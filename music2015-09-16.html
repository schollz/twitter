    var descriptionData = {"Brand New": "There are two artists with this name 1. A popular rock band 2. A funk group 1. Brand New is an American rock band that formed in 2000 in Merrick, New York. The band consists of Jesse Lacey (lead vocalist/guitarist/lyricist), Vincent Accardi (guitarist/lyricist),Garrett Tierney (bassist), Brian Lane (drummer), and Derrick Sherman (guitarist/keyboardist). Formation (2000-2001) Prior to Brand New&#x27;s official formation, in the late 1990s Jesse Lacey, Garrett Tierney, Brian Lane were all members of the post-hardcore band The Rookie Lot, along with Brandon Reilly and Alex Dunne of Crime in Stereo. After the band&#x27;s split and not playing together for a while, Lacey, Lane and Tierney started to rehearse again. They then recruited guitarist Vincent Accardi, who had been playing in a band called One Last Goodbye, since Reilly had joined The Movielife. All four members had backgrounds linking into their local Long Island independent and hardcore music scenes, but with influences from an array of artists ranging from Buddy Rich to The Archers of Loaf. They eventually formed Brand New in 2000, in a basement in Merrick, New York. Their initial intention was always to &quot;move outside of whatever notions they felt inclined to when they were making music as younger people. &quot; The band gained exposure in the local scene through playing shows with alternative rock contemporaries Midtown and post-hardcore bands like Glassjaw, whilst also self-releasing a four-song demo. They signed to Triple Crown Records just after their second-ever show. Your Favorite Weapon (2001-2002) Brand New&#x27;s debut studio album Your Favorite Weapon was produced by friend and practical fifth member of the band Mike Sapone. The album has been described as being &quot;bitter about ex-girlfriends&quot;, with an excessive concentration on &quot;post-breakup angst&quot;, receiving relatively positive reviews, with Allmusic awarding it three out of five and Popmatters also being favourable. It became a moderate success, selling over 50,000 copies. The record deal gave Brand New the opportunity to tour, playing alongside the likes of Taking Back Sunday and touring the UK in support of Finch, to a &quot;great response&quot; from the crowds. The only single released from Your Favorite Weapon was Jude Law and a Semester Abroad. The song has been described by Allmusic as a &quot;semi-hit&quot;, after it received airplay on both MTV2 and Fuse. Deja Entendu (2003-2004) Brand New&#x27;s second studio album was written in &quot;the year and-a-half or two years&quot; that they were touring the material off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, &quot;Jesse wrote a lot of the lyrics about different things than &#x27;I just broke up with my girlfriend&#x27; for the new record,&quot; as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, &quot;All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that all of us were listening to. For the first we weren&#x27;t in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that has a lot to do with it. &quot; Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album. The band released Deja Entendu through Razor &amp; Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, with it being issued in Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album&#x27;s title, Deja Entendu, is French for &quot;already heard. &quot; It was explained as &quot;very tongue-in-cheek,&quot; by singer Lacey. Elaborating on the title&#x27;s meaning, he told MTV, &quot;No matter who you are or what your band is about, you can&#x27;t put a record out without people saying it&#x27;s derivative of something else. So by saying the record&#x27;s already been heard, it&#x27;s kind of like saying, &#x27;Yeah, you&#x27;re right. We&#x27;re doing something that&#x27;s already been done before. We&#x27;re not trying to break new ground in music. We&#x27;re just trying to make good music. &quot; The album was described as a &quot;stylistic leap&quot; from Your Favorite Weapon, with a &quot;decidedly matured&quot; sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem like we&#x27;re departing from anything, really. I think we always knew that we had a lot of potential and there&#x27;s a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where we were going to go from there. &quot; Deja Entendu debuted at number 63 on the Billboard 200. After just seven weeks, the album&#x27;s sales were at more than 51,000 copies, already closing in on the total figure of its predecessor, Your Favorite Weapon. In May 2007, four years after its release, it was certified gold for surpassing 500,000 sales in the United States, by the Recording Industry Association of America . Deja Entendu&#x27;s first single, The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows, impacted radio airplay in July 2003, a month after the album&#x27;s release. The song was said to be about regret, or &quot;How there can be problems in a relationship and they get ignored. And how that often ends up as a broken home or some kind of bad situation down the road. It&#x27;s kind of something that if it wasn&#x27;t overlooked in the first place, you can kind of get through it. &quot; The song&#x27;s music video chronicles the moments after a severe car accident, where a mortally wounded Lacey cannot depart for the next world until he knows that his girlfriend, also injured in the crash, is safe in this one. He says it &quot;is about death or losing someone and it&#x27;s those moments that you kind of look back on your life and realize all the regrets that you had, and all the things you wish you could change&quot;. They also made a music video for the second single, Sic Transit Gloria&#8230; Glory Fades, where Lacey acts like a human voodoo doll; discovering that when he moves a particular body part, it is mimicked by the target of his action. &quot;Since the song is about taking advantage of someone else,&quot; he said, &quot;there&#x27;s a pretty strong correlation between the video and the song. &quot; Both music videos gave the band exposure in the mainstream where Your Favorite Weapon went &quot;virtually unnoticed&quot;, with the videos finding &quot;constant&quot; airplay on MTV and the band making its live television debut on The Jimmy Kimmel Show. Furthermore, both singles entered the top 40 on the UK Singles Chart, whilst The Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows peaked at number 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. Three shows of the band&#x27;s 24-date headlining US tour with Moneen, Senses Fail, and The Beautiful Mistake had sold out prior to even having released a single, with much of the buzz surrounding the band being produced by just word of mouth, touring and Internet message boards. Deja Entendu&#x27;s success also earned them tours alongside New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, Dashboard Confessional, and Blink-182. The band went on to headline The Bamboozle festival with My Chemical Romance, Alkaline Trio, Thrice, The Starting Line, Fall Out Boy, The Bouncing Souls, Straylight Run and Flogging Molly. They also made their second trip to the UK in 2004, their first as the headline act, the tour completely sold out. After being pegged as an act to watch in Rolling Stone&#x27;s annual &quot;Hot Issue&quot;, topping punk critics&#x27; year-end lists with the &quot;genre-defying&quot; Deja Entendu, with it also becoming a &quot;landmark album of so-called &#x27;emo-punk&#x27; and the band&#x27;s notable underground following; Brand New found itself in the middle of a bidding war from record labels. At the time, Lane protested the label of &quot;bidding war&quot;, but conceded, &quot;There&#x27;s a few labels that are definitely interested. We&#x27;ve been talking to a lot of people for a while and we&#x27;re narrowing it down. &quot; The band eventually signed with DreamWorks Records, which was then taken over by Interscope Records. The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me (2005-2008) Following their signing to Interscope, Brand New stopped touring to work on their third album and major label debut. In this time, little to no interviews or updates came from the band. In 2004, Jesse Lacey told Chart magazine that he had written a &quot;few songs&quot; for the next album, commenting that &quot;the other guys love it already&quot;. He made mention of the pressure he felt with the &quot;loads of anticipation building up on my shoulders,&quot; saying that he even felt depressed because of this; &quot;I&#x27;m getting depressed with all of the anxiety about the album and they say I write my best stuff when I&#x27;m in that state. Great, I&#x27;ll spend the next six months all depressed and the rest of band will be excited, so that some good (material) might come out. And then I have to contend with how it&#x27;s received. &quot; Lacey also said that the album would &quot;move into new territory for Brand New&quot;. In late 2005, Brand New started recording their highly-anticipated third album in Oxford, Mississippi with producer Dennis Herring, but later dropped him in favor of Mike Sapone with whom they had worked on their first album. In January 2006, nine untitled demos recorded for the album were leaked to the Internet. In response to the leak, Garrett Tierney stated &quot;I would say it did it in a good way &#x27;cause so many people were curious to hear what we have been doing&ndash;and for the most part, the record tracks don&#x27;t sound anything like the leaked demos. &quot; However, Lacey was not so upbeat when asked, saying, &quot;For me it was different. It had me pretty down for a while. No one likes to show their creation in mid-process, and those songs weren&#x27;t done. They were like blueprints. Just the plan, right? It put me in a state where I was under the impression that those songs had been wasted or something--that we had to go and write new things because those had been heard. Now, in retrospect, I want those songs to be on the album and many of them aren&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m probably more to blame for that than anyone. This record already feels incomplete to me without those tracks and probably will forever. &quot; In the following months, with Brand New doing their first tour dates in over 18 months, a few songs from the demos were performed with a full band, some were fleshed out and had new lyrics. New songs had their debut as well during the summer tour dates. Brand New began their first tour in years on June 20, 2006, where Lacey stated that the album had been completed the previous day. Alternative Press published a preliminary date of October 10, 2006, as the album&#x27;s release date, this was later corrected on the band&#x27;s official website ( http://www. fightoffyourdemons. com/ ), when it was announced that the new album would be released on November 21, 2006 in North America, and the day before in Europe. Soon after, a track listing and cover art were revealed, as well as new information regarding the release of the first single - Sowing Season. Having previously been leaked as a demo, the completed song began airing on radio on October 19, 2006, and appeared on their MySpace page a day later. According to Lacey in a radio interview with BBC Radio 1s Zane Lowe, the title The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me is taken from a conversation he had with his friend about the musician Daniel Johnston, who has bipolar disorder. In late December 2006, an unusual video was released for the instrumental track Untitled, also known as &quot;-&quot;, which mainly consists of a man spray painting a wall with &quot;evil and good are raging Inside me&quot; and correcting it to give the album title. On January 16, 2007, Jesus Christ was announced as being the official first single from the album. On January 19, the band performed the song on Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien. They performed it again on February 26 on the Late Show with David Letterman. From January to June 2007, the band toured the United States, Europe, Canada, and Australia, including a headline slot on the UK&#x27;s Give It A Name festival and playing the main stage at The Bamboozle festival. Despite the band&#x27;s reluctance towards the press around the time of the release of the album, they were featured in Alternative Press, a cover story for Rock Sound, Kerrang!, and NME. The band went on tour for the fall of 2007, with openers Thrice and MewithoutYou. In early 2008, Brand New toured Australia and New Zealand on the Big Day Out festival. In October 2007, the band announced via their official website that a new song, entitled Fork and Knife, would be released online on October 23, 2007. Fork and Knife, a rerecorded version of the track formerly known as &quot;Untitled 7&quot; from the leaked demos, was released as a non-album digital download. In March 2008, Brand New started their own record label, named Procrastinate! Music Traitors. The first act signed to the new label was longtime friend Kevin Devine. The first release from the label was a reissue of the 2006 Kevin Devine album, Put Your Ghost to Rest, in April 2008. Daisy (2008-present) In October 2008, it was stated that Brand New was in the studio winding down their new record and were currently recording vocals. Then in December, an update on Brand New&#x27;s website announced that they had been in and out of the studio since about March, with roughly fifteen tracks to choose from. The album was recorded over a 12 month period from March 2008, with the band announcing in April 2009 that they had commenced mixing with Dave Sardy and that they hoped to release their fourth studio album in the summer of 2009, with potentially, a summer tour to follow. The release date was then delayed to October 2009, which was announced during a live performance at the 2009 Glastonbury Festival, where Brand New played two new songs, tentatively titled &quot;Bride&quot; and &quot;Gasoline&quot;. In June 2009, UK music magazine Rock Sound, claimed on their website that they had received a copy of the upcoming album, though it was, according to an image later posted by the editor, &quot;incomplete&quot;. The site published a &quot;tentative&quot; track listing and reported the incomplete version that they had received to be roughly 30 minutes long. In an interview with Kerrang!, Jesse Lacey commented on the upcoming album&#x27;s content, &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty exhausting record. It&#x27;s quite dense and I think some of the decisions we made don&#x27;t always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking a lot more about what we&#x27;d want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you&#x27;d want to hear on a record. &quot; He then questioned the future of the band, saying, &quot;I think a lot of the record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it&#x27;s time to put something away and move on. &quot; On July 7, it was announced that the album would be titled And One Head Can Never Die (to be typeset and one head can never die) and would be released through Interscope Records on September 22, 2009. However, on July 9 it was announced on the band&#x27;s website that the album title had been changed to Daisy, still being released on the same day. The album&#x27;s first single, At the Bottom, was released through digital outlets on 11 August 2009. Daisy saw vocalist Jesse Lacey step back from songwriting and giving the role to guitarist Vincent Accardi along with the other members of the band. Daisy debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 in the US, selling 46,000 records in what was their first top 20 entrance on the chart after The Devil and God Are Raging Inside Me had reached number 31. When asked if rumours were true that Daisy would be the band&#x27;s final release, Lacey replied &quot;I don&#x27;t think that will be true. It might be our last full-length record for a little while, but we&#x27;ve got a lot of things lined up that we want to record, so I think that will happen pretty soon. &quot; In early 2010, drummer Brian Lane stated that Brand New were unsure about how they plan to release music in the future with technology being a factor; &quot;I don't know if there's a point to releasing records if they're not physical releases, if we&#x27;re going to release a lot of things digitally then I don't see why we couldn't release a song a week or a song a month or just put out what we like from whenever we record. &quot; Lane also discussed the way the band may release their records in the future, &quot;We're talking about recording another album but we don't know whether it's going to come out on a label or whether we just release songs in batches. &quot; On April 28, 2010, at their show in Clifton Park, NY, it was announced that the band is no longer signed to Interscope Records. In mid February, 2011, Brand New updated their website with a background change, along with releasing 5 new tour dates from their Facebook feed. This is the first public activity shown from the band since the early days after the release of their album, Daisy. On April 26, Lacey announced at their Baltimore show that they have been writing material but have had difficulties as they are &quot;tired of bumming you guys out. We're trying to write something happy. &quot; 2. Brand New was a funk group active during the 1970&#x27;s. ", "Beyonce": "Beyonce (born Beyonce Giselle Knowles , September 4, 1981) is an American pop/RnB singer, songwriter, record producer, actress and model. Beyonce was named Billboard&#x27;s Top Female Artist of the 2000s in February 2009 as well as their Artist of the Millennium in May 2011. She was the RIAA&#x27;s top certified and best-selling overall artist of the decade and the NRJ Music Awards also awarded her as their Artist of the Decade in France. She is one of the most influential artists of the century with record sales surpassing 130 million. She holds the record for the most viewed female viral video of all time with Single Ladies (Put A Ring On it) which has views of 600+ million. Born and raised in Houston, Texas, Beyonce began performing in local competitions at age 7, eventually forming the group Girl&#x27;s Tyme in 1990 with help from her parents. Girl&#x27;s Tyme became Destiny&#x27;s Child in 1997. During the hiatus of Destiny&#x27;s Child in 2003, Beyonce released her debut solo album, Dangerously in Love, which became one of the most successful albums of that year, and signaled her viability as a solo artist. The disbanding of Destiny&#x27;s Child in 2005 facilitated her continued success: her sophomore solo album B&#x27;Day, released in 2006, debuted at number one on the Billboard charts. Her third solo album, I Am. . . Sasha Fierce, was released in November 2008, and in 2009 she received 10 Grammy Awards nominations. On January 31, 2010, she won 6 Grammy Awards, breaking the record for most Grammy awards won by a female artist in one night; she previously held the record of five awards with 5 other artists. Following a career hiatus, Beyonce released her fourth studio album entitled &quot;4&quot; on June 24, 2011, which debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200. 2013 - 5th Album - Beyonce&quot; On December 12, 2013, Beyonce unexpectedly released her fifth and self-titled album in the iTunes Store. Beyonce called it a &quot;visual album&quot; as it includes 14 songs and 18 videos - with each track having a music video together with additional bonus videos. The album has a list of collaborators including Drake, Frank Ocean and her husband, Jay-Z, and daughter, Blue Ivy. 2015 In February 2015 at the 57th Grammy Awards, Beyonce won 3 Grammys (and was nominated for 6 Grammy awards) - Best R&amp;B Song for &quot;Drunk in Love&quot;, Best R&amp;B Performance and Best Surround Sound Album for Beyonce. On April 4th, 2015, Beyonce surprised her fans with the release of a new single and accompanying video, released exclusively on the streaming service &quot;Tidal&quot; which she co-owns with a number of other big name starts including Arcade Fire, Daft Punk, Jack White, Kanye West, Madonna, Rihanna and Usher. The track, &quot;Die With You&quot; is a stripped down ballad, with Beyonce sitting at a piano with pigtail braids: the song celebrates the seventh anniversary of her marriage to Jay-Z. Beyonce began her acting career in 2001, appearing in the musical film Carmen: A Hip Hopera. In 2006, she starred in the lead role in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls, for which she earned two Golden Globe nominations. On April 4, 2008, Beyonce and Jay-Z were married in a small, private ceremony in New York. On January 7, 2012, Beyonce gave birth to a daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York. Beyonce launched her family&#x27;s fashion line, House of Dereon, in 2004, and has endorsed such brands as Pepsi, Tommy Hilfiger, Armani and L&#x27;Oreal. In 2009, Forbes listed Beyonce fourth on its list of the 100 Most Powerful and Influential Celebrities in the world, third on its list of the top-grossing musicians, and number one on the list of top Best-Paid Celebs Under 30 with over $87 million dollars in earnings between 2008 and 2009. Beyonce has attained five Hot 100 number one singles, becoming one of the two female artists--joint with Rihanna--with the most number ones attained within the 2000s, excluding her three Hot 100 number one singles with Destiny&#x27;s Child. ", "Girlpool": "Cleo and Harmony from Los Angeles, CA. http://girlpoolmusic. com/ https://girlpoool. bandcamp. com/ https://www. facebook. com/GIRLPOOOL http://instagram. com/girlpoool https://twitter. com/girlpoolband", "The Weeknd": "The Weeknd, the stage name for Abel Tesfaye, is a Canadian singer-songwriter and producer. The Scarborough, Toronto-born singer, songwriter, and producer doesn&#x27;t say much outside of his lyrics or personal messages through his social networking sites. Ever since appearing on the scene in late 2010, he&#x27;s been shrouded in mystery, cultivating a mystique that baffles our gossip-obsessed pop culture. With that said, the 25-year-old alternative R&amp;B phenomenon is an enigma in more ways than one. For him, it&#x27;s not about becoming famous. It&#x27;s not about becoming rich. It&#x27;s not about pleasing anyone. It&#x27;s about being honest, staying true to his art, and diving headfirst into the deep end. History&#x27;s most impactful artists from Van Gogh and Charles Bukowski to Miles Davis and John Lennon faced both the abyss and the heavens. They knew about sex, drugs, pain, joy, and love, and they weren&#x27;t afraid to talk about them openly. On his three-disc debut for XO/Republic Records, Trilogy, The Weeknd is an open book, revealing everything and nothing at the same time. There are moments of ecstatic electronic bliss like the irresistible &quot;High for This&quot;, and then there&#x27;s the propulsive poetic paranoia of &quot;House of Balloons&quot;, which twists a sample Siouxsie and the Banshees&#x27; Happy House into a frenetic danceable coup. With an inimitable and divine voice, he sings of hazy nights that turned into hazier mornings and tumultuous trysts that spiraled into eternal longing. However, you can take whatever you want from it. After all, it is art. His trip officially began with the release of the nine-song free album House of Balloons in March 2011. It was the first in a series of three-including Thursday and Echoes of Silence-and it immediately set the blog-o-sphere ablaze. Soon after the initial instalment impacted the net, Drake quoted lyrics from the effort on Twitter and linked to the music, becoming the first of many A-list artists to champion it. The two quickly forged a tight friendship and fertile artistic partnership that extended to Drake&#x27;s team. As they grew closer, the superstar MC even enlisted his talents for several tracks on the chart-topping, platinum-selling and Grammy Award winning album Take Care. Most notably, The Weeknd co-wrote, co-produced, and performed on &quot;Crew Love&quot;, a bona fide hit single from the record. Further collaborating, Drake dropped a transfixing verse on &quot;The Zone&quot; from Thursday. The artist hit the road for his first sold out headline tour that summer, and the world began to embrace him with open arms from underground bloggers to taste-making music supervisors. &quot;High for This&quot; even served as the soundtrack to the trailer for the final season of HBO&#x27;s long-running series, Entourage, a symbol of his infiltration into the zeitgeist. Meanwhile, critics and gatekeepers also fell under his spell. Complex dubbed House of Balloons the &quot;best album of 2011&quot;, and Pitchfork honored it as &quot;Best New Music&quot;. It conquered year-end lists, including Stereogum, The A. V. Club, The Guardian (UK), and Spin. MTV, BET, Rolling Stone, XXL, and others exalted it with equally high praise, while The Source called him the &quot;Songbird of his generation&quot;. In the midst of everything, other marquee artists began to personally seek out his unique talent, and that was the highest compliment. He created the first formal remix for FLORENCE + THE MACHINE&#x27;s &quot;Shake It Out&quot;, and he put his stamp on LADY GAGA&#x27;s &quot;Marry the Night&quot;, yielding a seductive and sensual take on the single for Born This Way: The Remixes. The Weeknd also personally cooked up &quot;Remember You&quot; the second single for WIZ KHALIFA&#x27;s anxiously awaited sophomore effort, O. N. I. F. C. In the summer of 2012, a groundbreaking strategic alliance between XO, creative collective visionary behind The Weeknd and Republic Records was established. Under this banner, Trilogy compiled House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence in one expansive collection, properly mixed, mastered, and finished for the very first time. The 27 original tracks remain, but there&#x27;s also a myriad of new material as well to please both the initiated and uninitiated alike. The doorway officially opens into his world with this effort. The first single &quot;Wicked Games&quot; bleeds brilliantly with a stark and vivid admission that&#x27;s utterly enthralling. Keyboards resound through airy production as the vocals exude a dark sensuality. The singer admits, &quot;I love to watch you dance, take you down another level and get you dancing with the devil&quot;, before the unforgettable, unbridled hook, &quot;Let me motherfucking love you&quot;. You&#x27;re going to motherfucking love him. Live audiences continue to as well. In addition to surprise appearances on DRAKE&#x27;s Club Paradise tour and a stint supporting FLORENCE + THE MACHINE, he dazzled crowds at the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella, Primavera Sound Festival, and the Wireless Festival in London and on a seemingly endless run of sold out headline gigs. The next chapter has begun though. Coming together, Republic Records and the Canadian XO are paving the way for a revolution. Already, XO has progressed from an intimate Toronto operation into an international player. Everything stems from the music though, and it always will. THE WEEKND addressed fans in an open letter online, &quot;You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. No matter what an artist&#x27;s ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. &quot; He released his second album, &quot;Kiss Land&quot;, on September 10, 2013. ", "Queens of the Stone Age": "Queens of the Stone Age is a rock band from Palm Desert, California, United States. The band is frequently labeled stoner rock, although they reject the label. They developed a style of riff-oriented, heavy music which the band&#x27;s founder and mastermind Josh Homme described as &quot;robot rock&quot;, saying that he &quot;wanted to create a heavy sound based on a solid jam, just pound it into your head&quot;. Since then, their sound has evolved to incorporate a variety of different styles and influences. While in high school, Homme got together with locals Brant Bjork, Chris Cockrell (later replaced by Nick Oliveri) and John Garcia resulting in the formation of Kyuss (firstly known as &quot;Sons of Kyuss&quot;). Queens of the Stone Age formed in 1997, rising from the ashes of Kyuss and began playing together during the now legendary Desert Sessions. Homme has drawn all of the members from that diverse group of musicians for Queens of the Stone Age. The band originally formed under the name Gamma Ray, but almost faced a lawsuit from the European metal band of the same name. Queens of the Stone Age have gone through many line-up changes since first breaking into the hard rock scene. Their most recent line-up includes: Josh Homme (guitar, vocals), Troy Van Leeuwen (guitar, lap steel, keyboards, backing vocals), Jon Theodore (drums, percussion), Michael Shuman (bass, backing vocals), and Dean Fertita (keyboards, guitar, backing vocals). Former core members include Joey Castillo, Alain Johannes, Natasha Shneider, Mark Lanegan, and Nick Oliveri, among other members and contributors. In 2002, regarding the band line-up, Homme said: &quot;It really is more of a musical experiment. . . It keeps moving and reinventing itself. That way we never get painted into a corner. &quot; Dave Grohl recorded drums, percussion and backing vocals on Songs for the Deaf and toured in support of the album in 2002 before returning to the Foo Fighters. Grohl also made a live appearance in 2007, to play Make It wit Chu , and recorded tracks on . . . Like Clockwork , following Joey Castillo&#x27;s departure. Mark Lanegan has long been an on/off vocalist for the band, toured from 2001 to 2005 and made live appearances in 2007 and 2010. He has recorded with the band on all albums except for their self-titled debut album. Lanegan has also played keyboards in live performances during the tour preceding the release of Lullabies to Paralyze , before Natasha Shneider joined the band. Josh Homme and Nick Oliveri were seen as the only two consistent Queens of the Stone Age members. Oliveri had previously played alongside Homme in the band Kyuss and joined Queens of the Stone Age as its permanent bass guitarist and co-lead vocalist, in 1998, upon the release of its debut album, Queens of the Stone Age . Being friends since childhood, the two meshed well together. Oliveri&#x27;s punk background brought an element of danger and attitude to the Queens&#x27; live shows. As the band&#x27;s two core members, the duo recorded the breakthrough albums, Rated R and Songs for the Deaf , together. Oliveri&#x27;s unique &quot;howling&quot; singing style made him easily distinguishable on songs such as Six Shooter from the album Songs for the Deaf ; he also displays a more melodic singing style in Rated R songs such as Auto Pilot . However, Homme fired Oliveri in 2004 for excessive partying and an alleged incident of domestic abuse (an accusation which Oliveri strongly denies). The duo repaired their friendship shortly afterwards. Oliveri, however, did not return to the band. In 2013, upon hearing that former contributor Dave Grohl was recording drums for the band&#x27;s sixth studio album, . . . Like Clockwork , Oliveri asked Homme if he too could return on bass guitar. Homme ultimately did not grant Oliveri&#x27;s request. He does, however, appear on backing vocals on the album track, If I Had a Tail .

Since the release of their fourth album, Morgan Nicholls has also appeared with the band at live performances to provide keyboards, samples/synth, and backing vocals. Their sound is a blend of alternative rock, classical music, electronica, metal, spanish guitars, and progressive rock. Usually they use the bass line as the driving force, often with the guitar providing only an extra layer to the song rather than carrying the melody, the bass has distortion and other effects applied to it to achieve a greater weight, allowing the guitar to digress from the main tune and play higher notes. Another peculiarity is Muse's piano style in many of their songs; their music has been inspired by the works of Romantic pianist-composers such as Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky and Liszt, and has thus resulted in a fusion of Romantic style with modern rock. The band are known for their energetic live performances and front man Matthew Bellamy&#x27;s eccentric and avid interests in global conspiracy, extraterrestrial life, theology and the apocalypse (as much as in Space and theoretical physics). Their lyrical themes involve madcap conspiracy theory, revolutionary rabble-rousing, weird stuff about aliens (or Zetas, if you please), religions and other such classic Muse concerns. In general their music and lyrics gaze on helplessly at the subjugation of humanity by corrupt world leaders and encroaching environmental or galactic disasters (and certainly their fourth album &#x27;Black Holes And Revelations&#x27; has its fair share of climate change/oil crisis/global inflagration paranoia). In October 1999, Muse released their first full length LP; &#x27; Showbiz &#x27;. The album received mixed reviews among critics, and music fans, labeling the band as &#x27;Radiohead copycats&#x27;. This, however, did not stop the album from selling over 700,000 copies, with success coming from singles; Unintended and Muscle Museum . The album also earned Muse a nomination at the 2000 BRIT Awards, for Best New Act. 2001, with John Leckie behind the desk again, saw the release of Origin of Symmetry along with Top 20 entries for Plug in Baby and New Born . The album went unreleased in the United States until 2005 because their record label at the time, Madonna&#x27;s Maverick , allegedly thought the falsetto vocals would discourage radio play and wanted the band to re-record alternate vocals. The band refused, and terminated its contract with Maverick. Muse followed up with a b-side/live CD/DVD named Hullabaloo Soundtrack , showcasing the band&#x27;s concert from France in late 2001. To promote the album, Muse also released the Dead Star/In Your World EP, which charted high in the UK charts and proving Muse could also write &quot;radio-friendly&quot; rock tunes, as well as the 7 minute long epics on Origin of Symmetry. Muse polished off their impressive year by winning Best Live Band at the 2002 Kerrang! Awards. In 2003, Muse asked Rich Costey to step behind the desk to help create Absolution . The album had very strong sales all over the world, and helped the band achieve their first UK number 1 album. Its release was preceded by a download-only single and online video for the song Stockholm Syndrome . Followed by the singles Time is Running Out and Hysteria , which charted well in the UK charts and helped Muse secure a headline spot at the 2004 Glastonbury Festival. Glastonbury saw Muse storm troop onto the high table of classic Glastonbury headline acts and prove themselves a formidable force in British rock. Although many had their doubts at putting Muse on the bill with names such as Paul McCartney, Muse proved them all wrong and played what Bellamy described as &quot;the best gig of our lives. &quot; It was only with that triumph fresh in their throats, they claim, that they realised they&#x27;d &#x27;made it&#x27;. However tragedy struck just shortly after Muse came off stage when Dom Howard&#x27;s father (a big Muse fan) collapsed after witnessing his son play and died on the site. Later that year, Muse toured the US, promoting Absolution, before returning home to play two sell-out gigs at London&#x27;s Earls Court at the end of the year. In 2006 and after a long and exhaustive tour, the band returned to the studio, and released Black Holes and Revelations . Interview with Dominic 2006 With the LP, the band secured their second UK album chart number one, whilst reaching the top spot in several other countries, as well as a Top 10 in the US billboard chart. The controversial single Supermassive Black Hole became Muse&#x27;s highest UK entry in the charts, reaching number four, and also scored high entries in other countries. The album&#x27;s second single, Starlight , reached number 13 in the UK charts in September 2006. The 3rd UK single was fan-favourite Knights of Cydonia , released on November 27th, and it reached number 10 in the UK charts. The 4th single from Black Holes &amp; Revelations was Invincible , and was released April 15th 2007. It entered the UK singles chart at 21st place, and was the first single from the new album not to enter in the Top 20. On November 2, 2006, the band won an award for Best Alternative Act at the annual MTV EMA in Copenhagen. Muse were also named &#x27;Best Live Act&#x27; at the Brit Awards in 2006 and have retained the title in 2007. Two of the album&#x27;s singles reached the highest US Modern Rock chart positions in the band&#x27;s career during 2007: Starlight reached #2 in February 2007, and the all-falsetto Supermassive Black Hole reached #6 in October. 2007 also saw the band play to sellouts at Madison Square Garden and the Forum in Los Angeles, as well as headlining Austin City Limits Festival and Lollapalooza . Even when the band says they do not see themselves as a massive stadium band, their headline concert on June 16th 2007, at the rebuilt Wembley Stadium, sold out in 45 minutes six months before the gig and the band had to add a second show on June 17, where they proved to be more than worthy of stadium gigs. The Wembley gigs became two of the biggest hyped concerts of 2007. Already the gigs have been compared by music journalists to Live Aid and Queen gigs, also performed on the &quot;Hallowed Ground. &quot; The band&#x27;s next release, HAARP: Live from Wembley , is expected to be made up of footage from the June 17th show. In July 2007, Bellamy confirmed that he had begun to work on a new studio album and new songs, some more in line with electronic or &quot;dance&quot; music and others more with classical or symphonic music. In January 2008 the song &quot;Knights of Cydonia&quot; was voted number 1 on the Triple J Hottest 100, Australia&#x27;s biggest annual alternative music countdown. In 2009, the band released The Resistance , which contained the successful single &quot;Uprising&quot;, the band&#x27;s first Top 40 pop hit in the United States (achieving this with very little radio airplay) and their first #1 on the Billboard Modern Rock Chart. Followup singles &quot;Resistance&quot; and &quot;Undisclosed Desires&quot; also proved successful. The band&#x27;s sixth album, The 2nd Law , was released on 1 October 2012. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Survival&quot;, is the official song of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The second single, &quot;Madness&quot; was released on 20 August 2012. The third single, &quot;Follow Me&quot; was released on 7 December 2012, with an accompanying lyrics video released on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel on 1 November 2012. The album has recieved generally positive reviews, with Allmusic noting &quot;their excursions into dubstep and dance music on tracks like &quot;Madness&quot; and &quot;Follow Me&quot; feel more like remixes than original songs. &quot; Their latest album Drones was released on June 5 2015", "Deerhunter": "Deerhunter is a band which formed in 2001 in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. The band consists of Bradford Cox (vocals, guitar, piano), Moses Archuleta (drums, synths), Lockett Pundt (guitar, organ, vocals), Josh McKay (bass, vocals) and Frankie Broyles (guitar, vocals). The group began with the ambition of fusing the lulling hypnotic states induced by ambient and minimalist music with the klang and propulsion of garage rock. The band has weathered chaotic line-up changes and the death of a member. Cryptograms was the second full-length offering from Deerhunter, and their first for Kranky. The album took almost two years to finish and was the product of emotional, physical, and financial strain on the group. The result is an album that finds the band shifting from discordant catharsis, and forming a sonic identity that completely expresses the place from which they have arrived. The first half of the album was recorded first unsuccessfully in 2005. These recordings were a blur at best, wordless and bordering on psychological atrophy. The sessions failed to provide anything tangible, and were racked with technical and personal problems, including out-of-tune pianos, panic attacks, and a tape machine that seemed to fail to capture the full spectrum of ambience the band was exploring. The band returned home, having failed, and considered giving up. The idea arose to give it one last shot and exactly one year from the date of the recording of their first self-titled LP at a small studio in rural Georgia, they returned to that same studio and plugged in. The session resulted in the first half of the record which was recorded in one day and completely filled the reel of tape they brought with them. Cryptograms' first side begins with an introduction leading to the title track, and ends with the tape literally spinning off the end of the reel in the middle of a drone layered with bells and accordion (Red Ink). The second half of the record, also recorded in one day, in November of 2005, represents the band in an entirely different state. Spring Hall Convert opens with the line, \". . . so I woke up. . . \" and introduces a set of focused psych-pop songs fixating on adolescence, illness, and failing connections. On May 8, 2007, the group released the Fluorescent Grey EP, which was recorded in July 2006. This EP also garnered the title of &quot;Best New Music&quot; from Pitchfork Media. In the same month, the band released the Whirlyball 7&quot; single, which was available at only one store in Atlanta, Georgia: Criminal Records. The single also acted as a ticket to a show, which featured the band along with The Carbonas, Selmanaires and The Coathangers. The single was available online for a limited time after the show due to popular demand, but only 200 copies were pressed, with 100 on black vinyl and 100 on clear vinyl. The quartet&#x27;s third album, Microcastle, came out in October of 2008 after being leaked accidentally in May. The physical release was accompanied by an album entitled Weird Era Cont. . They were both well-received, scoring a 9. 2 and &quot;best new music&quot; on Pitchfork and taking the #1 slot for Tiny Mix Tapes&#x27; annual favorite albums list for 2008. The band added guitarist Whitney Petty, a former sailor and high school friend of Cox&#x27;s, to replace the departing Colin Mee in May 2008. She in turn left the band in February 2009. The band followed up the critically acclaimed Microcastle/Weird Era Cont. set in May 2009 with an EP - Rainwater Cassette Exchange. In September 2010, Deerhunter released Halcyon Digest on the label 4AD. The album received broad critical acclaim, including being rated #20 on the NME &quot;50 Best Albums of 2010. &quot; Deerhunter made their US broadcast television debut on Conan, December 2, 2010, where they performed Helicopter. Deerhunter are set to release their sixth album, Monomania, in May 2013. It will be their first album without bassist Josh Fauver, with Frankie Broyles and Josh McKay being added to the group. The Black Lips described the album as the &quot;most punk album of the last 30 years&quot;. http://deerhuntertheband. blogspot. com", "Porcupine Tree": "Porcupine Tree is a British rock band formed in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, United Kingdom in 1987. During the course of the band&#x27;s history, it has at times incorporated psychedelic rock, alternative, ambient, electronic, and, most recently, metal and post-rock into its unique style of progressive rock. Porcupine Tree started out as a &quot;fake&quot; band, the only real member being multi-instrumentalist Steven Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s first two releases, Tarquin&#x27;s Seaweed Farm (1989) and The Nostalgia Factory (1990), were both released on cassette tapes. In addition to the band&#x27;s trademark psychedelic sound, these two tapes also contained heavy ambient and pop influences. Wilson&#x27;s favorite tracks were then compiled into the CD On the Sunday of Life&#8230; (1991), while the more ambient-leaning tracks were also collected in Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape (1994). The first of these two featured many new versions of songs. Wilson then went on to release Voyage 34 (1992) and Up the Downstair (1993), which refined the sound of the previous albums and removed the pop influences. Both of these were later re-released, the first as Voyage 34: The Complete Trip (2000), which included an extra two remixes (a total of four), while Up the Downstair was remastered at 2005 with real drums added in place of the drum-machine beats. The Sky Moves Sideways (1995), often considered the band&#x27;s best album by long-time fans, largely uses the spacey nature of previous albums. By the time of Signify (1996) Wilson had a full band at his disposal: Chris Maitland (drums), Colin Edwin (bass), and Richard Barbieri, formerly of Japan, on keyboards. The band&#x27;s next two albums, Stupid Dream (1999) and Lightbulb Sun (2000), saw them take on a more alternative rock-oriented sound, while still drawing influence from as far back as Up the Downstair . During this period, the band garnered increasing recognition, both in their home country and abroad. Finally, they were signed to Lava Records (a major American record label) in time for the release of In Absentia , with Gavin Harrison replacing Chris Maitland on drums. This album shows high metal influences, due in part to Wilson&#x27;s work with Opeth on their album Blackwater Park . The band continued this sound for their 2005 release, Deadwing , which has the heaviest and most noticable metal influences. In April 2007, the band released their album Fear of a Blank Planet . an album clearly influenced by the post-rock genre, but also sees them expanding the metal side of their music, yet still remaining true to older facets of the band&#x27;s sound. In April, 2007, the band embarked on a six-month world tour in support of Fear of a Blank Planet , one that included Europe, the U. S. , Japan, and Australia. The new album was featured, and the show featured the films and projections by the band's long-time visualist Lasse Hoile. Fear of a Blank Planet is already the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful album of the band&#x27;s career, charting high in most countries (even giving the band their first top-forty album in their home country). Porcupine Tree spent most of 2007 on tour promoting the album, and a new EP Nil Recurring containing material left over from the album-writing sessions was released on the band&#x27;s own label Transmission in September. The band started recording their tenth studio album-- The Incident . --in February 2009. This was confirmed by the band, posting this message on their official website: &quot;Writing for the next PT studio record is well underway, with the band recently spending two weeks scheduled in the English countryside working on new tracks. Recording of these pieces and a new 35 minute SW song cycle were due to start in February&#8230;&quot; A tour was announced on the band&#x27;s website and MySpace, along with dates, following release of the new album. Around March and April, Wilson commented the 35-minute song kept evolving and now it has become a 55-minute song, occupying the entire disc. On 20 May 2010, Porcupine Tree released their second live concert film on DVD and Blu-Ray titled Anesthetize , it was recorded live on 15 and 16 October 2008 in the Netherlands at the 013 Tilburg venue. On 17 June, the band announced on their website that a new live album titled Atlanta, recorded during the tour of Fear Of A Blank Planet at the Roxy theatre, Atlanta, on 29 October 2007, would be released in a near future. This album was released via online distribution only, without any class of physical format; all the sale proceeds were donated to Mick Karn for his treatment against cancer. ", "Ludwig van Beethoven": "Ludwig van Beethoven (16 December 1770 - 26 March 1827) was a composer of the transitional period between the late Classical and early Romantic eras. He was born in Bonn, Germany. Beethoven is widely regarded as one of the greatest masters of musical construction, sometimes sketching the architecture of a movement before he had decided upon the subject matter. He was one of the first composers to systematically and consistently use interlocking thematic devices, or \"germ-motives\", to achieve unity between movements in long compositions. (Some insight into the meaning of the germ-motive device is given at the end of this bio. ) Equally remarkable was his use of \"source-motives\", which recurred in many different compositions and lent some unity to his life's work. He made innovations in almost every form of music he touched. For example, he diversified even the well-crystallised form the rondo, making it more elastic and spacious, which brought it closer to sonata form. He was mostly inspired by the natural course of nature, and liked to write songs describing nature. Beethoven composed in a great variety of genres, including symphonies, concerti, piano sonatas, other instrumental sonatas (including for violin), string quartets and other chamber music, masses, lieder, and one opera. Beethoven&#x27;s compositional career is usually divided into Early , Middle , and Late periods: In the Early (Classical) period, he is seen as emulating his great predecessors Haydn and Mozart, while concurrently exploring new directions and gradually expanding the scope and ambition of his work. Some important pieces from the Early period are the first and second symphonies, the first six string quartets, the first three piano concertos, and the first twenty piano sonatas, including the famous &quot;Pathetique&quot; and &quot;Moonlight&quot; sonatas. The Middle (Heroic) period began shortly after Beethoven&#x27;s personal crisis centering around his encroaching deafness. The period is noted for large-scale works expressing heroism and struggle; these include many of the most famous works of classical music. Middle period works include six symphonies (numbers 3 to 8), the fourth and fifth piano concertos, the triple concerto and violin concerto, five string quartets (numbers 7 to 11), the next seven piano sonatas (including the &quot;Waldstein&quot; and the &quot;Appassionata&quot;), and Beethoven&#x27;s only opera, Fidelio . Beethoven&#x27;s Late (Romantic) period began around 1816. The Late-period works are characterised by intellectual depth, intense and highly personal expression, and formal innovation (for example, the Op. 131 string quartet has seven linked movements, and the Ninth Symphony adds choral forces to the orchestra in the last movement). Many people in his time period do not think these works measured up to his first few symphonies, and his works with J. Reinhold were frowned upon. Works of this period also include the Missa Solemnis , the last five string quartets, and the last five piano sonatas. Destructuring the sonata form, both in the overall schema (movements, tempos) and in the micro-form, Beethoven began to use germinal ideas propelling the whole melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic progression. In the first quartet of the group (E flat major, Op. 127 - February 1825), the Adagio has five variations (in this case, a source-theme becomes the backbone of the tempo). That same year, in July, Quartet in A minor, Op. 132, features a first movement with the traditional two themes, but without contrast; they display and disseminate sub-sections and 'germs' in a circular frame, interlocking with each other. Beethoven&#x27;s germ-motive is like a Bach choral, summoning the other voices around itself. The last quartet, Op. 135 in F major, was composed in a downplayed form, going back to a more traditional four-tempo structure. But internally one finds the same frozen micro-structure: the first movement is harmonically ambiguous, whereas the scherzo sounds like Bartok, and in the finale, the canon 'Es muss sein' plays a joyful role. A terrible grave comes in afterward, to dissolve into a soft pizzicato: adieu music, adieu life . It was never heard by the now deaf Beethoven, and he died shortly afterward. ", "The Wonder Years": "The Wonder Years is an American pop punk band from Lansdale, Pennsylvania, United States that formed in June 2005. Since their conception, they have released four full-length albums, two EPs, and several splits/compilations. The group is currently signed to Hopeless Records.

The band formed in Aberdeen, Washington in 1987, and it was part of the Seattle grunge scene of the late 80s, alongside bands like Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden. As their popularity rose, alternative rock became a dominant genre on American and Canadian radio and music television during the early-to-mid &#x27;90s. In late 1987, Cobain and Novoselic recruited drummer Aaron Burckhard (1987-1988). The three practiced material from Cobain&#x27;s Fecal Matter tape. After losing contact with Burckhard, the pair instead practised with Dale Crover of the Melvins, and Nirvana recorded its first demos in January 1988. Their first single, a cover version of &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, a song by Dutch group &#x27;Shocking Blue&#x27;, was released in November 1988 on the Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. Their debut album, &#x27;Bleach&#x27; , was produced by Jack Endino and released in June 1989. Later that year, the band recorded the &#x27;Blew EP&#x27; with producer Steve Fisk. At the start of the new decade, the band commenced their first recording sessions to the follow-up album with producer Butch Vig, substituted their drummer by Dave Grohl and signed to DGC Records. The result, &#x27;Nevermind&#x27; , would eventually sell over seven million copies in the United States, and over 30 million worldwide. In early 1993, Nirvana released &quot;Puss&quot;/&quot;Oh, the Guilt&quot;, a split single with The Jesus Lizard, on the independent label Touch &amp; Go. Meanwhile, the group chose Steve Albini as the producer to record its third album. &#x27;In Utero&#x27; debuted at number one on the Billboard album chart in September the same year. As Nirvana &#x27;s frontman, Cobain found himself referred to in the media as the &quot;spokesman of a generation&quot;, with Nirvana the &quot;flagship band&quot; of &quot;Generation X&quot;, their third studio album &#x27;In Utero&#x27; was considered to be a conscious attempt to shed their audience. While Nirvana &#x27;s mainstream popularity waned in the months following its release, their core audience cherished the band&#x27;s dark interior, particularly after their 1993 performance on MTV Unplugged with the Meat Puppets, a band that Cobain had always idolised, performing with them the songs Oh, Me, Plateau and Lake of Fire. It was later released and topped the charts in 1994. Nirvana &#x27;s brief run ended with the suicide of Cobain in 1994, but the band&#x27;s popularity expanded in the years that followed. Eight years after Cobain&#x27;s death, &quot;You Know You&#x27;re Right&quot;, an unfinished demo that the band recorded two months prior to Cobain&#x27;s death, topped radio playlists around the world. Since their debut, the band has sold more than fifty million albums worldwide, including more than ten million copies of Nevermind in the US alone. Nirvana remains a consistent presence on radio stations worldwide. In 2004, the box set &quot;With the Lights Out&quot;, a collection of radio sessions, home demos, studio demos and outtakes, was released. A year later, &quot;Sliver: The Best Of The Box&quot; was released, a compilation of selected &quot;WTLO&quot; tracks, but with 3 new tracks including a track from the famous &quot;Fecal Matter&quot; demo. Band members : Kurt Cobain - vocals, guitar (1987-1994), Krist Novoselic - bass (1987-1994) Dave Grohl - drums, vocals (1990-1994) Prior members :Aaron Burckhard - drums (1987-1988), Dale Crover - drums (1988, 1990), Dave Foster - drums (1988), Chad Channing - drums (1988-1990), Jason Everman - guitar (1989), Dan Peters - drums (1990) Touring members : Pat Smear - guitar (1993-1994), Lori Goldston - cello (1993-1994), Melora Creager - cello (1994) &mdash; 2) Nirvana is a UK-based progressive rock band formed in 1967, primarily active in the late 1960s and early 1970s - and still sporadically active to the present day. The band was formed in the summer of 1967 in an era when melodic pop/rock music with baroque and chamber arrangements and instrumentation was highly-prized. The band, consisted of two songwriter/performers - Greek-born Alex Spyropoulos and Irish-born Patrick Campbell-Lyons who met in London. They produced a number of singles (notably &quot;Rainbow Chaser&quot;, &quot;Pentecost Hotel&quot;, and &quot;Tiny Goddess&quot;) for the fledgling Island Records label. The band was signed by Island Records&#x27; founder Chris Blackwell in the era when he also signed the bands Traffic and Free. In October 1967 the band released its first album - a concept album produced by Blackwell titled The Story of Simon Simopath. The album was probably the first narrative concept album ever released - predating story-driven concept albums such as The Pretty Things&#x27; S. F. Sorrow (December 1968), The Who&#x27;s Tommy (April 1969) and The Kinks&#x27; Arthur (September 1969). Musically, the group blended myriad musical styles including rock, pop, folk, jazz, Latin rhythms and classical music - primarily augmented by baroque chamber-style arrangements to create a unique entity. The next year 1968 their follow-up album, All Of Us, featured a similar broad range of musical styles. Their third album To Markos III was released on the Pye label in 1969. In 1971 the duo amicably separated for a while, with Campbell-Lyons the primary contributor to the next two Nirvana albums, Local Anaesthetic 1971, and Songs Of Love And Praise 1972. Campbell-Lyons subsequently worked as a solo artist and issued further albums: Me And My Friend 1973, Electric Plough 1981, and The Hero I Might Have Been 1983 though these did not enjoy commercial success. The band reunited in 1985, successfully touring Europe and releasing a compilation album Black Flower 1987 containing some new material. (Black Flower had been the provisional title of their third album. ) In the 1990s two further albums were released. Secret Theatre 1994 compiled rare tracks and demos, while Orange And Blue 1996 contained previously unreleased material including a tongue-in-cheek cover of the song &quot;Lithium&quot; originally recorded by the American grunge band Nirvana who released its first album in 1989, and who the band had successfully sued over use of the name Nirvana. The undisclosed terms of the settlement has apparently allowed the original Nirvana to continue using its name and issuing new recordings. In 1999 the band released a three-disc CD anthology titled &quot;Chemistry&quot; including several previously-unreleased tracks and some new material. Top musicians who played on Nirvana sessions include: Lesley Duncan, Herbie Flowers, Billy Bremner (later of Rockpile/Dave Edmunds fame), Luther Grosvenor, Wynder K. Frogg, Clem Cattini and the full lineup of rock band Spooky Tooth. The group was in the school of baroque-flavored, melodic pop-rock music typified by The Beatles of &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot;, The Beach Boys of Pet Sounds and God Only Knows, the Zombies of Odessey and Oracle and Time Of The Season, the Procol Harum of A Whiter Shade Of Pale, the Moody Blues of Days of Future Passed and Nights In White Satin and The Kinks of Waterloo Sunset. The majority of the tracks on Nirvana &#x27;s albums fall into that broad genre of contemporary popular music - not easily categorized - but perhaps best described as the baroque or chamber strand of &quot;progressive rock, soft rock or &quot;orchestral pop&quot;. Their first three albums were reissued on CD by Universal in 2003 and received critical acclaim. In 2005 Universal (Japan) reissued Local Anaesthetic and Songs Of Love And Praise. As of late 2005 the founding members Alex Spyropoulos and Patrick Campbell-Lyons are still sporadically writing and recording. &mdash; 3) Nirvana was a short-lived Finnish punk band formed in 1980, whose sole release was a 7&quot; vinyl with tracks &quot;Kielletyt leikit&quot; and &quot;Kuljen kaupungilla&quot; with 200 pressings. &mdash; 4) Nirvana was a Dutch pop group, formed in 1985 by producers Bernard Oattes and Rob van Schaik.

The group split up in 1987. &mdash; 5) Nirvana is a side project of The Skaters&#x27; James Ferraro.

They appear on several collections (YU Record Collector Dream, Boom Festival 72). ", "Olafur Arnalds": "Born 1986 in the suburban Icelandic town of Mosfellsbaer, a few kilometers outside of Reykjavik, composer/performer Olafur Arnalds has always enjoyed pushing boundaries with both his studio work and live-shows. Since the release of his debut album &quot;Eulogy for Evolution&quot; in 2007 he has built up a dedicated international following and is well established for his genre-crossing compositions blending classical, pop and ambient/electronica influences to a unique musical language. Starting out as drummer for several hardcore/metal bands, Olafur was asked to write instrumental intros and outros for the album &quot;Antigone&quot; of German metal band Heaven Shall Burn. This led to more work in the field of neo-classical strings and piano based music, and ultimately to the release of Eulogy for Evolution and the beginning of Olafur&#x27;s partnership with Berlin based label Erased Tapes. In 2008 he embarked on a tour with fellow Icelanders Sigur Ros. In 2009 he started a week-long project of composing one track by day, making it immediately available online to his fans. The collection was later officially released under the title Found Songs. He repeated the same experiment in 2011 under the title Living Room Songs. Also in 2009 the ballet Dyad 1909 premiered with a score composed by Olafur. Choreographed by Wayne McGregor and performed by Wayne McGregor Random Dance, the ballet was inspired by Ernest Shackleton's Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole in 1909. That year he also started Kiasmos, together with Janus Rasmussen. Kiasmos is a minimal techno based project. Their self titled debut album was released in 2014, preceded by the Thrown EP. In April 2010 Olafur released his second full-length album entitled &#8230;And They Have Escaped The Weight Of Darkness, which was backed up with an extensive tour, including his first trip to China. His third album, and the first to be released under his new partnership with Universal Music&#x27;s Mercury Classics imprint, is titled For Now I Am Winter and planned for international release in February 2013. Expanding on his previous work the new album features a full orchestra and - for the first time - introduces vocals to his soundworld. Icelandic singer Arnor Dan is to be heard on four tracks of the album. More recently Olafur has been venturing into the world of films, writing his first Hollywood film score to Another Happy Day. He also had music in the hit film The Hunger Games and has been featured several times on popular American television show So You Think You Can Dance. For 2013 his scores include the music to the new ITV thriller series Broadchurch, starring David Tennant and Olivia Colman, as well as to the film Gimme Shelter, directed by Ron Krauss and starring Vanessa Hudgens and Brendan Fraser. In 2014 Arnalds won the prestigious BAFTA Television Craft Award for his score to the BBC&#x27;s hit detective series &#x27;Broadchurch&#x27;. (2) Olafur Arnalds is a multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer who started as a drummer for a series of metal bands in his native Iceland. His entry into the neo-classical field was somewhat accidental. After German band Heaven Shall Burn heard some solo demo material, they asked him to provide piano-and-string pieces for their 2004 album Antigone. The Erased Tapes label heard the album, was impressed with Arnalds&#x27; contributions, and contacted him about recording a full album of material in that vein. The life-cycle concept album Eulogy for Evolution, released in 2007, was the result, with Arnalds &ndash; primarily on piano &ndash; supported by a string quartet. A trio of EPs followed in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, Arnalds provided the scores for the 13-minute short Blinky TM and the feature-length Oroi (Jitters), and he also released . . . And They Have Escaped the Weight of Darkness, his second proper album. His score for Sam Levinson&#x27;s Another Happy Day (2011) greatly increased his profile, as he continued to release works like Stare (2012) &ndash; a collaborative EP with Nils Frahm &ndash; and For Now I Am Winter (2013). Later that year, Arnaulds&#x27; scored the BBC television series Broadchurch, which produced its own soundtrack. A digital download of the composer&#x27;s score for Ronald Krauss&#x27; film Gimme Shelter was released in February of 2014, followed by a physical release in April. ~ Andy Kellman, Rovi", "Massive Attack": "Massive Attack are a trip-hop group which formed in Bristol, England in 1988. The group currently consists of Robert &quot;3D&quot; Del Naja and Grant &quot;Daddy G&quot; Marshall. Third member Andy &quot;Mushroom&quot; Vowles left the group in 1999. To date, the band has released five albums: &quot;Blue Lines&quot; (1991), &quot;Protection&quot; (1994), &quot;Mezzanine&quot; (1998), &quot;100th Window&quot; (2003), and &quot;Heligoland&quot; (2010). The group are considered to be progenitors of the trip hop genre. Their debut album, Blue Lines was released in 1991, with the single &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; reaching the charts and later being voted the 10th greatest song of all time in a poll by The Guardian. 1998&#x27;s Mezzanine, containing &quot;Teardrop&quot;, and 2003&#x27;s 100th Window charted in the UK at number 1. Both Blue Lines and Mezzanine feature in Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. The group has won numerous music awards throughout their career, including a Brit Award--winning Best British Dance Act, two MTV Europe Music Awards, and two Q Awards They have released 5 studio albums that have sold over 11 million copies worldwide. In the nineties, the trio became known for often not being able to easily get along with one another and working increasingly separately. Andy Vowles (Mushroom), who had once thought of himself as the trio&#x27;s musical director, acrimoniously left Massive Attack in late 1999, after an ultimatum from the other two members to end the group immediately if he did not. Despite having taken Del Naja&#x27;s side in the effective firing of Vowles and then participating in a show-of-unity webcast as a duo the following year, Grant Marshall (G) had also effectively left by 2001 in that he abandoned the studio altogether. Marshall returned to a studio role in 2005, having joined the touring line-up in 2003/4. The two later worked together again in the 2008 Damon Albarn sessions for the fifth proper studio album.

WAVE is now credited for iamamiwhoami&#x27;s recent visuals. ", "Thee Oh Sees": "Thee Oh Sees are a band from San Francisco, California, USA. The group began as an outlet for John Dwyer to release his instrumental, experimental home recordings, and over the course of several albums evolved into a full band. The band is noted for both its prolific album releases, energetic live shows, and their whimsical visual aesthetic that juxtaposes cartoon imagery and horror. The band has changed its name several times, being known as Orinoka Crash Suite, OCS, Orange County Sound, and The Ohsees. Some say John Dwyer (of Coachwhips, Pink &amp; Brown, OCS, Landed, Yikes, Burmese, The Hospitals, Sword &amp; Sandals, Superpit, The Drums, The Trawgs, Zeigenbock Kopf and Dig That Body Up It&#x27;s Alive!) is in Thee Oh Sees and he seems to be making this band the most serious project. He&#x27;s done everything from noise to death metal to punk and now Thee Oh Sees. Thee Oh Sees are no doubt the lightest of his excursions, but in contrast to the rest of his resume one could surmise that there are significant reasons for the change. Thee Oh Sees have a lo-fi electric-acoustic sound that&#x27;s usually soaked in reverb, making it as if you can hear and see the exact room they recorded in. It creates a very distinct mood that seems to fit their style, lyrics, and melodies. What most people focus on is that Mr. Dwyer is in the band. While it&#x27;s certainly a notable quality, the recent band members bring so much more to the table. The earliest recordings are Dwyer&#x27;s solo recordings, mostly single instrument/vocal ditties that you can hear him working out. They&#x27;re an intimate portrait of John, but without the recent material, the portrait would simply be incomplete. Thee Oh Sees don&#x27;t subscribe to any one style. With the addition of Brigid Dawson, Petey Dammit, and a rotating cast of drummers, the sound has grown into the landscape that one man couldn&#x27;t create alone. Brigid&#x27;s soprano voice brings an almost hauntingly sensitive aspect to the lyrics and melodies, while Petey and Mike&#x27;s pounding and insistent backline (and additional drums from Lars Finberg of The Intelligence on recent recordings) complete the frame in its entirety. Their energetic, sweat-laden shows coupled with their prolific recording schedule has garnered them a growing, dedicated fan base. The catalog that this band has put together is growing and growing, albeit under several different monikers, and several different labels. ", "Tamaryn": "Tamaryn are a duo formed in 2008 from San Francisco, California, United States fronted by Tamaryn, who is originally from New Zealand. Tender New Signs is the kind of record that exists where experiences connect to the senses, where memories emerge and bring with them all the feeling and imagery that had been resting just below the surface of consciousness. It&#x27;s the title of Tamaryn&#x27;s second album, in partnership with her longtime collaborator and San Francisco native Rex John Shelverton. Informing the layers and textures found on their debut full length The Waves, this new opus takes a bold step forward in structure and form. With it&#x27;s skygazing pop songs and impressionistic sketches of once well-guarded emotions, Tamaryn and Rex have created a defining work. The roots of this musical partnership started growing over a decade ago. \"Rex and I met in New York City where I was living in the early '00s,\" says Tamaryn. &quot;We bonded instantly and over time started sharing ideas for songs. Eventually we began to collaborate on some recordings, traveling between coasts until the project inspired me to move to California indefinitely. \" These activities culminated in a slew of singles and the Led Astray, Washed Ashore EP. In 2010, Mexican Summer released Tamaryn&#x27;s critically acclaimed LP The Waves, a collision of hypnotic psychedelia and bittersweet dream pop. Tender New Signs&#x27; nine songs showcase stadium-sized guitars, surging with softly-lit, languid melodies and a familiar sense of purpose anchored by Tamaryn's intimate vocal delivery and unmistakable presence. The choice to continue self production seems to be key in persevering their sound. Tamaryn explains how the writing process is intrinsically linked to the recording process, &quot;Rex finds that getting in the studio and taking things apart to adjust the subtleties of their sonics inspires him to want to play guitar more in general, and therefore is probably the biggest influence on how we make music. We like the idea of seeing how far we can take what we have, and we work best together without too many other distractions. The Waves found us in this 'minimal wall of sound,' so we took that style and applied it to these more defined song structures. \" Tracks like &quot;Heavenly Bodies&quot; are anthems of surrender and reflection, while &quot;The Garden&quot; evokes those tiny moments of change when numbness gives way to feeling, and projects them into gigantic rock and roll epiphanies. Tender New Signs creates its own hope and transforms it into something sublime. \"In making this record, I hoped to transcend the mundane world, by living in a new one of my own creation, &quot; Tamaryn says, &quot;now it&#x27;s time to invite everyone else in it with me. \" www. myspace. com/imagesmusic", "The Prodigy": "The Prodigy are a Braintree, Essex, UK, electronic music group (aka Prodigy ), formed by Liam Howlett (composition, keyboards), in 1990. They have sold over 20 million records worldwide, which is almost unequalled in dance music history. Their music consists of various styles ranging from rave and breakbeat hardcore in the early 90s to alternative rock and big beat, with punk vocal elements in later times. Other current band members include: Keith Flint (dancing, vocals), Maxim (MCing, vocals) and live guitarist Rob Holliday (Marilyn Manson, Gary Numan, Curve, Sulpher). Leeroy Thornhill (dancing, occasional live keyboards), was a member of the band from 1990 to 2000, as well was a female dancer / vocalist Sharky , who left the band during their early period. Other notable former live members include: Gizz Butt (guitar - English Dogs, Janus Stark, Sabbat) - toured with the band for three years throughout the late &#x27;90s, Kieron Pepper (drum - Realtv, Happy Gilmore) - played for the group from 1997 to 2007 (also contributing to the solo projects of Maxim and Flint &#x27;s band, Flint), as well as Jim Davies (guitar - Pitchshifter), who also performed in Flint. The Prodigy first emerged on the underground rave scene in the early 1990, releasing their debut LP Experience (1992) and have since then achieved immense popularity and worldwide renown. Some of their most popular songs include &quot; Charly &quot;, &quot; Out of Space &quot;, &quot; No Good (Start the Dance) &quot;, &quot; Voodoo People &quot;, &quot; Firestarter &quot;, &quot; Breathe &quot; and &quot; Smack My Bitch Up &quot;. The name displayed on album covers changed from &#x27; The Prodigy &#x27; to &#x27; Prodigy &#x27; between Music for the Jilted Generation and The Fat of the Land (1997) and back again with the release of Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned (2004). However, Howlett has attested the title has always been &#x27; The Prodigy &#x27; and the change was made only to fit within the displayed logo. Maxim originally began as an MC for the band before doing vocals on &quot; Poison &quot;, a track on their second album Music for the Jilted Generation and then several others on The Fat of the Land . He remains a member, MCing at the live shows. Flint began as a dancer for the band before moving on to become a vocalist initially on the track &quot; Firestarter &quot; but then for several others on the third album The Fat of the Land . Flint is probably the most visually recognisable member of the band and considered by many to be the front-man though he has very little input to writing the songs. He still sings with the live show but has virtually no input on the albums however, he did write the single &quot; Baby&#x27;s Got a Temper &quot;. Following the relative commercial and critical failure of 2004&#x27;s Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned the band released a greatest hits Their Law: The Singles 1990-2005 before 2009&#x27;s return to form Invaders Must Die . After the release and success of The Fat of the Land , Howlett was feeling down as he could not produce any songs up to standard up until one of his friends showed him the program Reason from Propellerhead Software. This program inspired him who instantly went to the studio and started producing tracks using it; he decided he did not want to use it for baselines though, as he prefers the analogue sound. ", "Joni Mitchell": "Joni Mitchell , CC, (born Roberta Joan Anderson on November 7, 1943 in Fort Macleod, Alberta, Canada) is a Canadian musician, singer-songwriter, poet and painter. A highly influential artist, she has received eight Grammy Awards during her career, with the first coming in 1969 and the most recent in 2008. She received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2002, with the citation describing her as &quot;one of the most important female recording artists of the rock era&quot; and &quot;a powerful influence on all artists who embrace diversity, imagination and integrity. &quot; She was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1981 and received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2000. In November 2006, her album &quot; Blue &quot; was listed by TIME magazine as among the &quot;All-Time 100 Albums&quot;. Mitchell began singing in small nightclubs in her native Western Canada and then busking on the streets of Toronto. Her writing and art talent emerged before her exposure as a gifted musician performing in Western Canada, including Winnipeg, where she met Neil Young. She then associated with the burgeoning folk music scene of the mid-1960s in New York City. Recording her debut album in 1968 and achieving fame first as a songwriter (&quot;Urge for Going&quot;, &quot;Chelsea Morning&quot;, &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;, &quot;Woodstock&quot;) and then as a singer in her own right. Finally settling in Southern California, Mitchell played a key part in the folk rock movement then sweeping the musical landscape. Blue, her starkly personal 1971 album, is regarded as one of the strongest and most influential records of the time. Mitchell also had pop hits such as &quot;Big Yellow Taxi&quot;, &quot;Free Man in Paris&quot;, and &quot;Help Me&quot;, the last two from 1974&#x27;s best-selling Court and Spark. In 1975 Joni released &quot;The Hissing of Summer Lawns&quot; which can be seen as an artistic turning point, and the beginning of her unique blend of folk, jazz and rock. It was intended as a concept album of sorts, with the &quot;concept&quot; being the contrast being freedom and slavery, and the idea that wealth and status sometimes ironically place a great many constraints on people&#x27;s behavior. Mitchell is also an accomplished visual artist. She has, through photography or painting, created the artwork for each of her albums, and has described herself as a &quot;painter derailed by circumstance&quot;. A blunt critic of the music industry, Mitchell has stopped recording over the last several years, and now focuses mainly on her visual art.

The band was formed by ex-busker and blues man Dave Brock in Ladbroke Grove, London, who intended to marry simple three-chord rock with experimental electronic music. He cites his influences for the band at the time as The Moody Blues, Steve Miller Band and the krautrock scene of Kraftwerk, Neu! and particularly Can. The band was formed in 1969 by visionary Dave Brock and although it has been subject to numerous line-up changes it is still led by him. The early line-up featured Dave Brock on vocals and rhythm guitar, Huw Lloyd-Langton on lead guitar, Terry Ollis on drums, Thomas Crimble on bass, Nik Turner on Saxophone and Dik Mik on synthesizer. The band became established as a space-rock underground band with their renowned concert at the Glastonbury Rock Festival 1970 when they set up in an alternative field and played a free concert, pulling crowds away from the main event. Their debut album, the self titled 'HAWKWIND', was released by EMI and to this day still sells steadily. In 1970 they appeared at the Isle of Wight Festival where Jimi Hendrix was spotted in the audience. He was asked to get up and join the band and he replied 'No I don't want to spoil it!' Huw Lloyd-Langton remained with them until late 1971. The band shot to fame in 1972 with their hit record 'Silver Machine' featuring Lemmy (now of Motorhead fame) on vocals. (This record featured in the soundtrack of a recent TV Mazda advert in the UK). In 1973 Simon House (Electric Violin) joined, and throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s, the renowned World famous Sci-fi author, Michael Moorcock often recorded and appeared with them. Lemmy was sacked from the band in 1975 after a drugs bust in USA, and went on to form 'MOTORHEAD', named after the last track he wrote for the band, a slang term for speed freak. Huw Lloyd-Langton joined Leo Sayer in 1974 and then in 1975 went on to form supergroup 'WIDOWMAKER' WITH Steve Ellis (Love Affair), Luther Grosvenor (Mott The Hoople), Paul Nicholls (Lindisfarne) and Bob Daisley (Ozzy Osborne). In 1977, Simon House joined David Bowie. Dave Brock and poet Bob Calvert tour as 'HAWKLORDS', performing the stage show 'METROPOLIS'. Throughout the 70&#x27;s, Hawkwind released a series of classic albums; 'IN SEARCH OF SPACE', 'DOREMI FASOL LATIDO', 'SPACE RITUAL', 'HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN GRILL', 'WARRIOR ON THE EDGE OF TIME', 'ASTOUNDING SOUNDS, AMAZING MUSIC', 'QUARK STRANGENESS &amp; CHARM' and 'PXR 5'. In 1979, Dave formed another nucleus with Huw Lloyd-Langton on lead guitar, Simon King on drums, Harvey Bainbridge (from Hawklords) on bass and Tim Blake from 'Gong' on keyboards. Their live album 'LIVE 79' went straight into the national top ten charts chart. In 1980 Ginger Baker replaced Simon King on drums and they recorded their classic album 'LEVITATION'. Once again, the release went straight into national top ten album chart. Tim Blake and Ginger Baker remaied with the band until after the Christmas Tour 1980. From 1979 to 1985 the band's singles and albums were never out of the national, independent and heavy metal charts, with albums such as 'SONIC ATTACK, 'CHURCH OF HAWKWIND&#x27;, &#x27;CHRONICLE OF THE BLACK SWORD, &#x27;LIVE CHRONICLES&#x27; AND &#x27;XENON CODEX&#x27;. Nik Turner who left the band in 1975 briefly rejoined the band 1982-1983 for the 'CHOOSE YOUR MASQUES' tour. In 1984 Alan Davey replaces Harvey Bainbridge on bass and Harvey moved over to keyboards and synths. In 1985 the band tour with the spectacular 'CHRONICLES OF THE BLACK SWORD', a stageshow portraying music and images based on Michael Moorcock's epic saga, 'ELRIC'. During this period the band reached a new audience with the emergence of ambient acts such as The Orb openly acknowledging Hawkwind's influence. Huw Lloyd-Langton remained with the band throughout the end of the 80s, departing in 1989 followed shortly after by Harvey Bainbridge. The band continued to perform live throughout the nineties, and had some noteable album releases such as, &#x27;SPACE BANDITS&#x27;, &#x27;PALACE SPRINGS&#x27;, &#x27;ELECTRIC TEPEE&#x27;, &#x27;IT IS THE BUSINESS OF THE FUTURE TO BE DANGEROUS&#x27;, &#x27;THE BUSINESS TRIP&#x27;, &#x27;ALIEN 4&#x27;, &#x27;LOVE IN SPACE&#x27; and &#x27;DISTANT HORIZONS&#x27;. During their entire existence the band have performed numerous free concerts, notably STONEHENGE and have supported various charities, which include SHELTER, when in 1977 at the Blackheath Concert Halls they raised thousands of pounds for the homeless, and even released a charity single version of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; with Samantha Fox guesting on vocals. N. A. S. A. in the USA have also used sound tracks from the 'LOVE IN SPACE release. In 1997 they headlined the '1ST SPACEROCK FESTIVAL USA'. In 2000, the band staged the highly successful 'HAWKESTRA' event at the London Brixton Academy, which saw many past members reunited on stage with a nucleus of Dave Brock, Ron Tree, Jerry Richards, Hugh Lloyd-Langton, Simon House, Richard Chadwick, Alan Davey and Tim Blake. In 2001 they were voted the 8th top progressive band in the country on Channel 4 TV. The band have recently released a double live cd recording of their Xmas 2000 &#x27;Yule Ritual&#x27; show at the London Astoria, as well as the Arthur Brown helmed &#x27;Out of the Shadows&#x27; in 2007. The concept of a Hawkestra, a reunion event featuring appearances from all past and present members, had originally been intended to coincide with the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary and the release of the career spanning Epocheclipse - 30 Year Anthology set, but logistical problems delayed it until 21 October 2000. It took place at the Brixton Academy with about 20 members taking part in a 3+ hour set which was filmed and recorded. Guests included Samantha Fox who sang Master of the Universe. However, arguments and disputes over financial recompense and musical input resulted in the prospect of the event being restaged unlikely, and any album or DVD release being indefinitely shelved. The Hawkestra had set a template for Brock to assemble a core band of Tree, Brock, Richards, Davey, Chadwick and for the use of former members as guests on live shows and studio recordings. The 2000 Christmas Astoria show was recorded with contributions from House, Blake, Rizz, Moorcock, Jez Huggett and Keith Kniveton and released as Yule Ritual the following year. In 2001, Davey agreed to rejoin the band permanently, but only afiter the departure of Tree and Richards. Meanwhile, having rekindled relationships with old friends at the Hawkestra, Turner organised further Hawkestra gigs resulting in the formation of xhawkwind. com, a band consisting mainly of ex-Hawkwind members and playing old Hawkwind songs. An appearance at Guilfest in 2002 led to confusion as to whether this actually was Hawkwind, sufficiently irking Brock into taking legal action to prohibit Turner from trading under the name Hawkwind. Turner lost the case and the band now perform as Space Ritual. An appearance at the Canterbury Sound Festival in August 2001, resulting in another live album Canterbury Fayre 2001, saw guest appearances from Lloyd-Langton, House, Kniveton with Arthur Brown on &quot;Silver Machine&quot;. The band organised the first of their own weekend festivals, named Hawkfest, in Devon in the summer of 2002. Brown joined the band in 2002 for a Winter tour which featured some Kingdom Come songs and saw appearances from Blake and Lloyd-Langton, the Newcastle show being released on DVD as Out of the Shadows and the London show on CD as Spaced Out in London. In 2005 the long anticipated new album Take Me to Your Leader was released. Recorded by the core band of Brock/Davey/Chadwick, contributors included new keyboardist Jason Stuart, Arthur Brown, tabloid writer and TV personality Matthew Wright, 1970s New Wave singer Lene Lovich, Simon House and Jez Huggett. This was followed in 2006 by the CD/DVD disc Take Me to Your Future. The band were the subject of an hour-long television documentary entitled Hawkwind: Do Not Panic that aired on BBC Four as part of the Originals series. It was broadcast on 30 March 2007 and repeated on 10 August 2007. Although Brock participated in its making he did not appear in the programme, it is alleged that he requested all footage of himself be removed after he was denied any artistic control over the documentary. . In one of the documentary&#x27;s opening narratives regarding Brock, it is stated that he declined to be interviewed for the programme because of Nik Turner&#x27;s involvement, indicating that the two men have still not been reconciled over the xhawkwind. com incident. June 2007 saw the departure of Alan Davey, who left to perform and record with two new bands: Gunslinger and Thunor. He was replaced by &quot;Mr Dibs&quot;, a long-standing member of the road crew and bassist for the bands Spacehead and Krel (who had supported Hawkwind during 1992). The band performed at their annual Hawkfest festival and headlined the US festival NEARfest and played gigs in PA and NY. At the end of 2007, Tim Blake once again joined the band filling the lead role playing keyboards and theremin. The band played 5 Christmas dates, the London show being released as an audio CD and video DVD under the title Knights of Space. The band&#x27;s official Website is to be found at www. hawkwind. com HAWKWIND and solo projects: Dave Brock, Nik Turner, Inner City Unit, Lemmy, Motorhead, Huw Lloyd Langton Group, Robert Calvert, Alan Davey, Bedouin, Michael Moorcock Deep Fix, Harvey Bainbridge, Agents Of Chaos ,Space Ritual, Spiral Realms,ect. A truly prolific act !", "The Beatles": "The Beatles were an iconic rock group from Liverpool, England. They are frequently cited as the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed band in modern history, with innovative music, a cultural impact that helped define the 1960s and an enormous influence on music that is still felt today. Currently, The Beatles are one of the two musical acts to sell more than 1 billion records, with only Elvis Presley having been able to achieve the same feat.  After conquering Europe, with successful tours to Germany and Sweden, the Beatles led the mid-1960s musical &#x27;British Invasion&#x27; into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored a great variety of musical styles including Psychedelic Rock, Experimental, Ballads, Western and Indian Classical among others. Their clothes, hairstyles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s.  Early on, the band consisted of George Harrison, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Stuart Sutcliffe, and Pete Best. The band got its first major break playing in Hamburg, Germany, at some rather seedy nightclubs, beginning in 1960. While in Germany, they also met Klaus Voormann, who would later design the cover of the group&#x27;s 1966 album Revolver. Sutcliffe remained in Germany when the others returned to England and became engaged to fellow artist Astrid Kirchherr, only to die a few years later of a brain hemorrhage. In 1961, Brian Epstein heard their sound and was thrilled enough to sign on as their manager, even though he had no previous experience in that field. After Decca Records rejected the band with the famous comment &quot;guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein&quot;, his efforts eventually led, in 1962, to an audition with EMI producer George Martin, who signed them to EMI&#x27;s Parlaphone label. Later, due in part to Martin&#x27;s refusal to use him on recordings, Pete Best was replaced by Ringo Starr, the drummer from another big Liverpool band known as Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. Ringo was supposed to play on their first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, but George Martin had Alan White, a session drummer, play instead (Ringo can be heard on the album version of the song).  In 1963, The Beatles initiated a craze known as &quot;Beatlemania&quot; in the UK with the song &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Their first album of the same title was recorded in just one day. This fame spread internationally and, in February of 1964, they arrived in the United States. Their first appearance in the States was on the Ed Sullivan Show, following &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; going #1 in the States. With this success, the Beatles released two feature length films within the space of two years: A Hard Day&#x27;s Night and Help! . The songs from both films were penned by Lennon and McCartney, and albums followed their release. In Help! , the Beatles were given greater creative freedom, deciding for example to head to the exotic location of the Bahamas simply to shoot one scene.   The Beatles were comprised of four members in the long run: John Lennon (vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Paul McCartney (vocals, bass guitar, piano, guitar), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals), and Ringo Starr (percussion, vocals). Lennon and McCartney were the main songwriters and singers, although songs penned by George started showing up more frequently on later albums. Ringo traditionally sang one song on each record. George Martin produced most of the Beatles&#x27; records, and was a highly influential part of the band&#x27;s sound on most of their records. He also played the renowned solo on &quot;In My Life&quot; (Rubber Soul).  For years, The Beatles showed an amazing talent for writing hit after hit. In 1966, they ceased performing in concert (apparently they grew weary of the constant screaming from the fans, which always got so loud they could never hear themselves play; another contributing factor was the extraordinary lengths they had to go to for security reasons before and after each performance) and began exploring new sounds in the studio. This is especially apparent in albums such as Rubber Soul , Revolver , Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band and The Beatles , sometimes known as &quot;The White Album&quot;. The White Album is considered the band&#x27;s most experimental. The novel sounds featured are due to the growing presence of Yoko Ono (Lennon&#x27;s wife), as demonstrated by the song &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, and the band&#x27;s increasing use of drugs. The song &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; (from Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s) was rumored to be an ode to LSD, although the band vehemently denied any link; they instead insisted that it described a drawing made by John Lennon&#x27;s son, Julian Lennon. After the death of Brian Epstein, the Beatles began to unravel at the seams. The Beatles officially split at the dawn of 1970; Lennon had unofficially quit the previous year and the band had maintained the front of being together to protect their business interests. McCartney, who was the first to announce that he had officially &quot;quit&quot; the band and that they no longer existed, was often blamed for the band&#x27;s ending although by the end he was the only one willing to carry on and was, by stating the group no longer existed, admitting to the facts.   The Beatles never reunited properly in the 1970s as they never fully recovered from the acrimony associated with their breakup. They did, however, make two new records in 1994, despite Lennon&#x27;s 1980 death, for the Anthology project. &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Real Love&quot; were based on demo tapes made by Lennon and sent to McCartney by his widow Yoko Ono. They charted in the UK at #2 and #4 respectively. The Beatles also created some of the first music videos, having filmed promotional films in 1965 for broadcasters to show across the US and Europe rather than have to appear live. Their 1967 film promos for &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; and &quot;Penny Lane&quot; have even more similarity to modern music videos, with each one created for just the individual song, and without the appearance of being a recording of a live performance. The Beatles were also the source of a number of controversies and conspiracy theories. John Lennon was quoted in 1966 as saying the Beatles were &quot;more popular than Jesus Christ&quot;, causing protests in many parts of the USA; although he publicly apologized for the statement, he also later claimed it was a contributing factor in the Beatles ending touring. A widespread urban legend that started in 1969 claimed that Paul McCartney was dead and had been replaced by a lookalike. The rumor was referred to by members of the Beatles a number of times, including John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot;.  George Harrison passed away in 2001. His death was marked by a large concert event in the Albert Hall. The Concert for George took place a year to the day of George&#x27;s death. Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney continue to make music. Ringo released Choose Love and Paul released Chaos and Creation in the Backyard both in 2005. Paul&#x27;s latest release is 2007&#x27;s Memory Almost Full . Also in 2008 Ringo released Liverpool 8. George Harrison once said \"The Beatles will exist without us. \" Deftly short and simple, this quote surmises their legacy, showing how The Beatles as an entity transcends not only the music or entertainment industry, but even the members themselves.  In 2006, a collaboration between Apple Corps, and Cirque du Soleil, culminated in a show called Love , showing only in Las Vegas. Starr, McCartney, Ono and Harrison&#x27;s widow, Olivia, all were involved in the production. The accompanying album is composed of new takes on original Beatles recordings, spliced together and creating new feels for several of their songs. The project was put together by renowned Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles.   The tracks in &quot;Love&quot; contain parts from original Beatles demo recordings, and George Martin created a new orchestral arrangement for an acoustic demo version of Harrison&#x27;s &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. In October 2007, Across the Universe , a musical film which incorporated Beatles songs into its narrative, was released in cinemas to mixed reviews. The film incorporates, and indeed appears to be built around, various songs throughout the Beatles&#x27; career, sung by the principles. Songs such as &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; actually tell the story at hand, while songs such as &quot;Let it Be&quot; and &quot;Across the Universe&quot; seem instead to provide a background or atmosphere around which the story is built. ", "Erykah Badu": "Erykah Badu (born Erica Abi Wright on February 26, 1971 in Dallas, Texas) is an American R&#x27;n&#x27;B/neo-soul artist whose work crosses over into jazz. She is best known for her singles You Got Me her collaboration with The Roots, as well as her own songs Tyrone, Love of My Life, On &amp; On, Bag Lady, The Healer, Honey and Soldier. Her lyrics are highly personal urban philosophy which throw emotional challenges in the face of the listener. She weaves unusual musical influences together creating a rich texture of sound. Some music journalists have labeled her Nu soul, nouvelle-soul or neo soul, often comparing her to Billie Holiday in lyrical delivery and grouping her with Maxwell and D&#x27;Angelo in musical genre. Baduizm, Badu&#x27;s highly acclaimed debut album, was released in early 1997 and debuted at #2 on the Billboard charts. Lead single On &amp; On reached #12 on the singles charts in both the U. S. and UK. Badu received notice for her introspective lyrics and jazzy, bass-heavy sound, and was hailed as one of the leading lights of the burgeoning neo soul genre. Her sophisticated style of singing drew many comparisons to Billie Holiday. Baduizm eventually went triple platinum and, along with On &amp; On, won Grammy Awards at the 1998 ceremonies. During that year, Badu became involved with rapper Andre 3000 of OutKast, with whom she had a child, Seven, who was born in 1997. Their relationship ended sometime in the late 90s. Badu recorded her first live album, Live, while pregnant with Seven, and the release of the recording coincided with the birth to her child. Live reached #4 on the Billboard charts, selling double platinum, and spawned another R&amp;B hit single in Tyrone a song chiding a selfish, cheap, and inattentive boyfriend. Badu also collaborated with The Roots (who had previously handled production duties on a number of tracks on Baduizm) on their breakthrough 1999 release, Things Fall Apart. She was featured on the song You Got Me co-written by Jill Scott, which hit the top 40 and won a Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. After taking some time off to raise her child, Badu returned in 2000 with Mama&#x27;s Gun, an album more organic in sound than her previous studio album, and primarily produced by the Soulquarians and noted bassist Pino Palladino. A remix of one of the album&#x27;s songs, Bag Lady was issued as the first single and topped the R&amp;B charts for seven weeks. The album was well-received, with the lyrical content winning notices from many publications who found some of her lyrics hard to decipher on her initial releases. Despite not charting as high as her first two albums, Mama&#x27;s Gun was another platinum-selling success, and Bag Lady was nominated for a Grammy. By 2000, Badu was in a romantic relationship with fellow Soulquarian Common, and Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop) was released as a collaboration between the two on the Brown Sugar soundtrack. Love of My Life hit #9 on the pop charts, topped the R&amp;B listings, and Badu was awarded her fourth Grammy for the song in 2003. After the release of Mama&#x27;s Gun and Love of My Life, Badu went through a period of writer&#x27;s block. She hit the road throughout 2002 and much of 2003 on what she dubbed the &quot;Frustrated Artist Tour,&quot; in search of inspiration to write and perform new material. The conclusion of the tour saw Badu head back to the studio with new material, and in September of 2003, the Worldwide Underground was released. More jam-oriented than any of her prior releases, Badu was quoted as saying that the release was designed to serve as one continuous groove. Worldwide Underground reached #3 on the Billboard charts and was certified gold not long after its release, and Badu received four further Grammy nominations for the EP. After almost four years and the birth of a daughter, Puma, it was revealed in 2007 that Badu had three albums in the works over the course of 2007 and 2008. Honey, a new single produced by 9th Wonder, was leaked online in November 2007, and the new album, titled New Amerykah Part One (4th World War), was released on February 26, 2008. On August 23, 2008, Badu joined the rock band My Morning Jacket on stage at their show in Dallas, Texas to perform her song Tyrone. Her surprise appearance was met with an enthusiastic reaction from the audience. On February 1, 2009 Badu gave birth to her third child, a girl named Mars Merkaba with her boyfriend Jay Electronica . Her album New Amerykah Part Two (Return of the Ankh) was released on March 30, 2010. ", "Andrew Jackson Jihad": "Andrew Jackson Jihad is an American folk/punk/rock group from Phoenix, Arizona, formed in 2004. They have been classified as everything from indie rock to anti-folk to Americana. Andrew Jackson Jihad was formed after its original drummer, Justin James White, approached Sean Bonnette and Ben Gallaty, who had just left Rodan (not the Rodan of Kentucky fame) and The Sub-Standards. Since then, many significant Arizona musicians have sat in with the remaining duo of Sean and Ben, including John De La Cruz of Fatigo and Asleep In The Sea&#x27;s Owen Evans. Dylan Cook also plays mandolin regularly with the band. According to Songfacts , Bonnette, who is also the lyricist of the band (with upright bass player Ben Gallant handling most of the production and some vocals as well) volunteered at a suicide prevention hotline for teenagers for eight years, and worked with homeless men and women in the Phoenix, Arizona area. These experiences gave him a sometimes bleak, but at moments, hopeful outlook on life, often reflected in the band&#x27;s lyrics. On Halloween 2005, Andrew Jackson Jihad covered Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s In the Aeroplane Over the Sea album in its entirety at CounterCulture Cafe. Their biggest performance to date has been in their hometown with Flogging Molly and Authority Zero on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day 2006. On April 15, 2006, the band played as part of the 2006 New Times Music Showcase, nominated for Best Americana Band, and won a 2006 Best of Phoenix later that year. Besides their local shows, where they have become arguably the most prominent representative in Arizona of the DIY ethic, they have also toured in clubs and basements across the Western United States, appearing at such venues as the Knitting Factory in Los Angeles, CA. One show in Kimberly, Idaho saw the band in a cowboy bar and leaving the premises as soon as possible after the show.

It has peaked at #1 in Austrailia, Ireland, New Zealand and the UK. It has also reached #2 in Brazil and the USA, making it their most successful album to date. It was so far been certified Gold in Austrailia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the USA. The first single, titled Ignorance, was released on July 7th 2009 for digital download and on September 14th 2009 in the UK. It has peaked at #1 on the UK Rock Chart, #14 in the UK singles chart, #35 in Austrailia, #67 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #96 in Canada. Brick by Boring Brick was the second single from the album, released November 23rd, 2009, and peaked at #2 on the UK Rock chart, #28 on the US Billboard Rock Songs, #29 in New Zealand and #85 in Austrailia. The third single is scheduled for release on April 19, 2010 and is titled The Only Exception. ", "Krewella": "Krewella is an electro group from Chicago, USA, comprised of sisters Jahan and Yasmine Yousaf, formerly joined by producer Rain Man.

", "Lana Del Rey": "Elizabeth &quot;Lizzy&quot; Grant (born 21 June 1986), better known as Lana Del Rey, is a singer-songwriter from Lake Placid, New York, United States. Del Rey is known for embellishing her songs and music videos with an eerily nostalgic vibe heavy on Americana themes, including images of surfing, Coney Island, Frank Sinatra, and Marilyn Monroe. She has also listed a large number of her artistic influences, including Allen Ginsberg, Elvis Presley, Britney Spears, Nina Simone, Nirvana, Leonard Cohen, Bob Dylan, The Beach Boys, Antony and the Johnsons, actor and filmmaker John Waters, artists Mark Ryden and Marilyn Minter, and photographers Juergen Teller and Philip-Lorca diCorcia. Grant released her first professionally produced body of work in 2010, an EP entitled Kill Kill , as Lizzy Grant via Five Points Records with producer David Kahne. It was available for purchase on iTunes for a brief period before being withdrawn for unknown reasons. Soon after, Del Rey released a self-titled collection of songs, Lana Del Rey , for electronic download. In June 2011, Del Rey was signed with Stranger Records and issued the \"Video Games\" single, and in October 2011 she signed with Interscope Records. Her next album, Born to Die , is set to be released worldwide on 31 January 2012 under Interscope. The second single and title track, &quot;Born to Die,&quot; is set for release on 22 January 2012. ", "Super Furry Animals": "Super Furry Animals (also known as &quot;SFA&quot;, the &quot;Furries&quot; and the &quot;Super Furries&quot;) are a critically acclaimed Welsh alternative rock band, with leanings towards psychedelic rock, punk, britpop and electronic experimentation. They formed in Cardiff, Wales in 1993 by Gruff Rhys (lead vocals, guitar), Huw Bunford (guitar, vocals), Guto Pryce (bass), Cian Ciaran (keyboards, electronics, vocals) and Dafydd Ieuan (drums, vocals) and have released nine full length albums and numerous EPs. The most recent release is 2009&#x27;s &quot;Dark Days/Light Years&quot;. -Early years- The band formed in Cardiff after being in various other Welsh bands and techno outfits in the area, among them Ffa Coffi Pawb. Lead vocalist/guitarist Gruff Rhys, drummer/vocalist Dafydd Ieuan and bassist Guto Pryce had been together since the early 1990s and had toured the north coast of France as a techno group. The other two members of the band are lead guitarist/vocalist Huw Bunford and keyboardist/vocalist Cian Ciaran; the latter is Ieuan&#x27;s younger brother. They then got to work on writing some songs, and in 1995 ended up signing to Ankst, the famous Welsh Indie rock label. The band are considered to be part of the renaissance of Welsh music (and art, and literature) in the 1990s: other Welsh bands of the time include Catatonia, Gorky&#x27;s Zygotic Mynci and the Manic Street Preachers. The actor Rhys Ifans was briefly lead vocalist of the band, before they found national success. The name of the band came from T-shirts being printed by Gruff&#x27;s sister. She was making Super Furry Animals T-shirts for the fashion and music collective and a side project of Cian&#x27;s, Acid Casuals (variants of whose name have appeared throughout SFA&#x27;s career - for example, in their song &quot;The Placid Casual&quot; and in their record label Placid Casual). The earliest SFA track to be commercially available is Dim Brys Dim Chwys, recorded in 1994 for Radio Cymru: an ambient piece, the track shows the band&#x27;s techno roots. However, by the time it was released on the &quot;Triskaphilia&quot; compilation album in August 1995, the band had already put out their debut EP on the Ankst label. The Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyndrobwllantysiliogogogochynygofod (in space) EP appeared in June 1995 to general critical acclaim and has been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as having the longest-ever title for an EP. The Moog Droog EP followed in October 1995, named after the synthesizer manufacturer Robert Moog and the Nadsat term for &quot;friend&quot; in &#x27;A Clockwork Orange&#x27; - (droog, itself though derived from the Russian word drug). The EP&#x27;s title is also a pun on the Welsh term Mwg Drwg, meaning &quot;wacky baccy&quot; (slang for cannabis, more literally &quot;bad smoke&quot;). The lyrics on all the tracks on both EPs were in Welsh, except for God! Show Me Magic. -Commercial breakthrough on a major label- After gigging in London in late 1995, they were noticed by Creation Records boss Alan McGee at the Camden Monarch club (only their second gig outside Wales), who signed them to his label. Creation was also home to the likes of Primal Scream and Teenage Fanclub, and had recently found massive commercial success with Oasis. The band have said that having watched their gig, McGee asked them if they could sing in English rather than Welsh in future shows. In fact, by this stage they were singing in English, but McGee didn&#x27;t realise, because their Welsh accents were so strong. In February 1996, the band&#x27;s debut on Creation, Hometown Unicorn, became NME&#x27;s Single Of The Week, chosen by guest reviewers Pulp, and the first SFA single to chart in the UK Top 50, peaking at #47. The follow-up, a re-recording of &quot;God! Show Me Magic&quot;, charted at #33 upon release in April 1996 and also became NME single of the week. Rawer than the &quot;Moog Droog&quot; version, it clocks in at only 1 min 50 secs. In May, their debut album Fuzzy Logic was released, again to wide critical acclaim. Sales were slow, with the album peaking at #23 in the charts, but it garnered a little more interest when next single Something 4 The Weekend (a reworked, more mellow version of the album track) was given considerable radio airplay and charted at #18 in July 1996. The final single from the album, If You Don&#x27;t Want Me To Destroy You, was to have been backed by a track called &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck&quot;. However, there were problems in clearing a sample from &quot;Showbiz Kids&quot; by Steely Dan which formed the basis of the chorus, and it was switched for a different track. The single charted at #18. However, SFA regarded The Man Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck as one of their best songs to date and continued their efforts to clear the sample. When they managed this, there was no upcoming release to attach it to - so it came out as a limited edition single in its own right, in December 1996. This ultimately cemented its legendary status and did much to establish SFA as cult heroes, as the song contained the word &quot;fuck&quot; over 50 times and was therefore received practically no airplay. However, it hit #22 in the charts and became SFA&#x27;s standard closing number when they played live. In early 1997, SFA embarked on the NME Brats Tour and completed work on a speedy follow-up to &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;. Two singles preceded the new album, Hermann Loves Pauline in May and The International Language Of Screaming in July, hitting #26 and #24 respectively: these releases were the first to feature cover art from Pete Fowler, who has designed the sleeves of all their releases since. The album, Radiator, hit shelves in August. The reviews were, if anything, better than those for &quot;Fuzzy Logic&quot;, and it sold more quickly than its predecessor, reaching a peak of #8: however, Creation did not serve the album particularly well by releasing it just four days after the long-awaited new effort from Oasis, &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. Two further singles, Play It Cool (released September 1997) and Demons (released November 1997) both hit #27 in the charts, suggesting that SFA had hit a commercial ceiling though which they were struggling to break. However, they had established themselves as favourites in the music press, a cut above the majority of their Britpop peers. After a chance to think about their music and their direction, SFA decided to recorded a new EP in early 1998 at Gorwel Owen&#x27;s house and released it in May. This was the Ice Hockey Hair EP, widely held as one of their finest moments. (&quot;Ice hockey hair&quot; is a slang term for a mullet - the haircut). Featuring four tracks, the EP presented SFA&#x27;s unmistakable songwriting skills alongside fresh-sounding beats and a loop sampled from Black Uhuru. The title track, a melodic and very moving epic, gained airplay while Smokin&#x27; became another favourite with the fans. Its &quot;I just want to smoke it&quot; refrain won instant appeal and approval. In a Melody Maker interview, SFA said the &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot; part referred to smoking haddock, or to truck drivers&#x27; tyres when they&#x27;re &quot;burnin&#x27; the roads&quot;. It became their most successful single up to this point, hitting #12 in the charts and leading to a memorable appearance on Top Of The Pops. In November 1998, the album Out Spaced was released. This was a collection of songs from the 1995 Ankst releases (including &quot;Dim Brys: Dim Chwys&quot;), the band&#x27;s favourite B-sides, plus &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck&quot; and &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot;. A limited edition appeared in a comedy rubber sleeve, shaped like a nipple. Many saw the collection as drawing a line under SFA&#x27;s initial phase, in preparation for more ambitious work to come. 1999 proved to be a big year for SFA. NME readers named them Best New Band in January. In May, the single Northern Lites was released and made #11 in the charts. A dense production, with steel drums clattering out a calypso rhythm whilst Gruff sang an irreverent lyric about Jesus, it was an apt taster for the new album, Guerrilla. Recorded at the Real World Studios, the album retained SFA&#x27;s pop melodies but took a less guitar-centric approach to their execution and was their most experimental work to date. Layers of samples over brass, percussion and Gruff&#x27;s melodic singing produced an album which took the freewheeling approach of 1960s groups such as The Beatles, The Beach Boys and The Velvet Underground and updated it to the late 1990s. The album swung from glam and garage rock inspired songs (Night Vision and The Teacher) to novelty techno (Wherever I Lay My Phone (That&#x27;s My Home)), ambient indietronica (Some Things Come From Nothing) and upbeat drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass (The Door To This House Remains Open). For the cover art, Pete Fowler created the band&#x27;s first three-dimensional models, rather than the paintings he had supplied for the &quot;Radiator&quot; album and singles. After playing several of the summer festivals, SFA released Fire In My Heart, the most soulful track from &quot;Guerrilla&quot;, in August and saw it chart at #25. They then embarked on a US and UK tour. SFA finished their UK tour at the Cardiff International Arena, where they showcased the first ever concert in surround sound and broadcast it on the Internet. -Creating their own label and singing in Welsh once again- January 2000 involved a series of changes for SFA. The last single from &quot;Guerrilla&quot;, &quot;Do Or Die&quot;, was released and made #20. It was also the last single SFA released on Creation Records, as founder Alan McGee set off to pursue other interests. It had always been SFA&#x27;s plan to release their next album on their own label, Placid Casual, as it would be a deliberate sidestep from their recent work: a largely acoustic album of Welsh language songs entitled Mwng. Meaning &quot;mane&quot;, its lilting melodies established that SFA&#x27;s songwriting did not have to fall back on head-spinning production tricks. A limited edition (of 3000) 7 inch record, Ysbeidiau Heulog (meaning &quot;Sunny Intervals&quot;) preceded &quot;Mwng&quot; in May 2000. It came backed with &quot;Change&quot;, a hard-rock jam recorded as a Peel Session for the BBC. The album, released the same month, sold remarkably well for a non-English LP - it made #11 in the charts - and received a rare distinction for a pop record, being commended in Parliament for its efforts in keeping the Welsh language alive. 2000 also saw the Furries nominated for a grammy, for their work on the sound collage &quot;Plastic Beatle&quot;. They undertook this remixing of unreleased Beatles recordings at the invitation of Paul McCartney, whom they had met at the NME Awards. -Back to one of the majors- With the demise of Creation, SFA needed to find a new label for their next album. Sony had long held a substantial stake in Creation and offered deals to many ex-Creation artists, including SFA, who signed with one of Sony&#x27;s subsidiaries, Epic. The band pushed for a deal which allowed them to take a new album elsewhere if the label wasn&#x27;t interested in releasing it - thereby allowing them to find a home for any esoteric project they might want to undertake in the future. The greater resources afforded them by Epic were apparent in their first album for the label, Rings around the World. Again the first single was a good indication of what was to come: Juxtapozed With U, released in July 2001, was a lush soul record which made #14 in the charts. The album followed in the same month and major label marketing muscle made it their biggest-seller to date, reaching #3 in the album charts. One of the tracks from the album, Receptacle For The Respectable featured Paul McCartney on &quot;carrot and celery rhythm track&quot; (a homage to his performance on the Beach Boys&#x27; Vegetables). SFA unleashed their experimental side on tracks such as Sidewalk Serfer Girl (which switches between light techno-pop and hardcore punk), &quot; (A) Touch Sensitive &quot; (gloomy trip-hop) and No Sympathy (which descends into chaotic drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass), but also apparent was an angrier edge to the lyrics: Run! Christian, Run! seemed to be an attack on the complacency of organised religion. &quot;Rings around the World&quot; is also remarkable for being the world&#x27;s first simultaneous release of an audio and DVD album. It was nominated for the Mercury Music Prize in 2001. The ceremony took place on the day after the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, and SFA&#x27;s performance of the album track It&#x27;s Not the End of the World? took on a somewhat bitter edge. It was released as a single in January 2002 (chart #30), following (Drawing) Rings around the World (chart #28): neither had that much impact but still received some airplay, notably on BBC Radio 2. The next album, Phantom Power, was released on CD and DVD in July 2003, preceded by a single, Golden Retriever, in June (chart #13). Although the reviews for the album were generally good and it sold well initially, charting at #4, the album broke little new ground by SFA&#x27;s standards and the band had fallen out of fashion, receiving little coverage in the music press. Another single, Hello Sunshine, hit #31 in October 2003 and was eventually featured on one of the soundtracks of &quot;The O. C. &quot; . Perhaps recognising that their approach to &quot;Phantom Power&quot; had been a little too straightforward, SFA followed it up in 2004 with a remix version, Phantom Phorce, with tracks reworked by the likes of Killa Kela, Four Tet and Brave Captain. They accompanied this with a download single, Slow Life, which also included the track Motherfokker, a collaboration with Goldie Lookin Chain. -Recent years, solo projects and other trivia- In October 2004 the band released a &quot;best of&quot; album, Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1, accompanied by a single - a live version of &quot;The Man Don&#x27;t Give A Fuck&quot; (chart #16). In early 2005, Gruff Rhys released a solo album Yr Atal Genhedlaeth, (&quot;The Stuttering Generation&quot;, and also a play on words as &quot;Atal Genhedlu&quot; means contraception), sung all in Welsh. Gruff played most of the instruments himself, mainly using guitars, drums and his own multi-tracked voice. The band also selected tracks for a volume in the &quot;Under the Influence&quot; series of compilations, in which artists present the songs that they feel have most contributed to their sound. Also in 2005 it was reported that SFA turned down a $1. 8 mio. advertising deal with Coca-Cola after visiting a Coca-Cola plantation in Colombia, where they heard of management directed killings of trade-union members. The company were asking for use of &quot;Hello Sunshine&quot; as part of their campaign. In a statement to British magazine Q, Coca-Cola denied the allegations, stating they had been &quot;an exemplary member of the business community&quot; in Colombia. In August 2005 SFA released the album Love Kraft, recorded in Brazil. This represented a departure from their previous working methods: Although all five members had always contributed to the development of the songs, Gruff had always been the main songwriter. On &quot;Love Kraft&quot; this was no longer the case, and all five members contributed songs and lead vocals. There was only one single from the album, Lazer Beam, released on 15 August (chart #28): the lack of subsequent singles is partly a reflection of the nature of &quot;Love Kraft&quot;, which is more of a coherent whole than their previous albums. The laid-back ambience recalls early-1970s The Beach Boys albums such as Surf&#x27;s Up (which SFA have referred to as their all-time favourite album), whilst the heavy use of strings suggests the likes of Scott Walker and Curtis Mayfield. The album&#x27;s cool commercial reception (it charted at just #19), suggests that they have returned to their familiar status of critically-acclaimed cult favourites. Cian&#x27;s side project Acid Casuals released their debut album Omni in January 2006 on the Placid Casual label. Daf is currently recording with his new band The Peth, which has been described by Gruff as &quot;Satanic Abba&quot;. In 2007 Gruff released his second solo effort, Candylion, which includes songs in English, Welsh and Spanish and collaborations with Lisa Jen and Sean O&#x27;Hagan of The High Llamas. Recording sessions took place in a chateau in the south of France in 2007 for the band&#x27;s first release for Rough Trade, Hey Venus!, which was released on August 27 that year. The record was a step back from Love Kraft, and is very much in the vein of the band&#x27;s late-90s&#x27; records. Gruff himself described the record as &quot;speaker blowing&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Show Your Hand&quot;, failed to enter the top 40, their first to do so since 1996&#x27;s &quot;Hometown Unicorn&quot;, despite modest airplay. The album itself faired much better, peaking at #11 and was a slight improvement from the sales of Love Kraft. The album became their first to enter the iTunes Music Store top 10 album charts, peaking no higher than #9. Over the 2007 christmas period SFA released the christmas single &quot;The Gift That Keeps Giving&quot; free from their website. For the album artwork for &quot;Hey Venus!&quot; the band tracked down the (in 2007) 82 year old Japanese artist Keiichi Tanaami to replace the album artwork of Pete Fowler&#x27;s with whom the band had had, what Gruff in an interview with Pitchfork called, &#x27;a blood pact&#x27; to make their cover sleeve artwork for 10 yeras. Although Gruff didn&#x27;t actually know if Tanaami was still alive, he had been a fan of his works for many years. Gruff also stated in the earlier mentioned interview that Tanaami apparently had been known to be one of the first people in Japan to take acid in the 60s, and that coincided with the first pizza parlor opening in Tokyo. So Tanaami used to go into this pizza parlor and look at all the different color combinations from the toppings and have a psychedelic experience. ", "Alabama Shakes": "Alabama Shakes is an American rock band formed in Athens, Alabama, United States in 2009. The group consists of lead singer Brittany Howard, guitarist Heath Fogg, bassist Zac Cockrell, and drummer Steve Johnson. Here is some background information on Alabama Shakes from the Hold On Songfacts : The R&amp;B-inspired Rock band Alabama Shakes originated when lead singer/guitarist Brittany Howard approached bassist Zac Cockrell during a high school psychology class in Athens, Alabama and the pair began meeting after school to write songs. Howard and Cockrell then approached Punk-Rock drummer Steve Johnson, who was working at a local music store, to join the band. The trio recorded some of their songs in a studio in Decatur, Alabama and subsequently recruited guitarist Heath Fogg on his return to Athens from college in Tuscaloosa. Originally christened &quot;The Shakes,&quot; the band later renamed themselves The Alabama Shakes in order to differentiate themselves from other bands with their original name. The Alabama foursome gained widespread media attention after releasing a self-titled four-song EP in September 2011 and Rough Trade Records in the United Kingdom and ATO Records in the United States signed them two months later. Hold On was released as the first single from their debut album, Boys &amp; Girls . ", "Graham Coxon": "Graham Coxon (born 12 March 1969), best known for his time in Blur (which he left in 2002 and re-united with in 2009), is a singer-guitarist whose sound is based in lo-fi and garage rock His first solo album,&#x27;The Sky is Too High&#x27;, was released in 1998 and has a very muted, uncommercial sound. &#x27;TSITH&#x27; was followed by &#x27;The Golden D&#x27; which features two covers of the band Mission Of Burma. The next album to come was &#x27;Crow Sit On Blood Tree&#x27;, which has some of his most ethereal tracks to date on, and is very lo-fi. Fourth album &#x27;The Kiss Of Morning&#x27; shows Graham developing as an artist in his own right and the songs take on a more fleshed out and accomplished form. However, it was not until the release of &#x27;Freakin&#x27; Out&#x27; in 2004 that Coxon had a solo mainstream hit. &#x27;Happiness In Magazines&#x27;, Graham&#x27;s fifth album, is largely considered to be his most accessible and complete work, featuring frantic, slick guitar-pop of the highest order. In 2006 Graham Coxon released his sixth solo album, &#x27;Love Travels at Illegal Speeds&#x27;, preceeded by the UK Top 20 single &#x27;Standing On My Own Again&#x27;. &#x27;Love Travels at Illegal Speeds&#x27; shows Coxon branching out to try his hand at some new sounds as well as tightening the punk-pop formula that is his hallmark. The album was released in two formats, with a DVD containing interviews and live tracks as an optional extra. It marks Coxon&#x27;s first album away from his now-defunct indie label &#x27;Transcopic&#x27;. Coxon also played guitar on Peter Doherty&#x27;s 2009 solo album Grace / Wastelands. 11th May 2009, Coxon released his 7th album &#x27;The Spinning Top&#x27;. 2009 will see Coxon embark on numerous gigs with Blur, including headlining Glastonbury Festival. ", "Red Hot Chili Peppers": "The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a funk rock band based in Hollywood, California and were formed in 1983, in Los Angeles, California. The band currently consists of founding members Anthony Kiedis (vocals) and Michael &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary (bass) along with a longtime member Chad Smith (drums). Guitarist John Frusciante quietly left the band on good terms in late 2008. On January 2, 2010, Josh Klinghoffer was announced as Frusciante&#x27;s replacement. The band initially formed for a one-off support act for a friend&#x27;s band, calling themselves Tony Flow And The Miraculously Majestic Masters Of Mayhem. Upon renaming themselves Red Hot Chili Peppers, they played a handful of small club venues in Los Angeles in 1983, before they were signed to EMI Records. Current members : Vocal : Anthony Kiedis (1983-present). Guitar : Josh Klinghoffer (2009-present). Bass : Michael Peter &quot;Flea&quot; Balzary (1983-present). Drums : Chad Smith, (1988-present). Previous members : Notable guitarists (in chronological order): Hillel Slovak (1983-1984), Jack Sherman (1984), Hillel Slovak (1985-1988), John Frusciante (1988-1992), Arik Marshall (1992-1993), Jesse Tobias (1993) Dave Navarro (1993-1998), John Frusciante (1998-2008) Notable drummers (in chronological order): Jack Irons (1983-1984), Cliff Martinez (1984-1987), Jack Irons (1987-1988), D. H. Peligro (1988), Chad Smith, (1988-present) The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; original founder and guitarist, Slovak, was replaced in 1984 by Jack Sherman, while Slovak and Irons recorded music with their band at the time, &quot;What Is This?&quot; Upon Slovak&#x27;s return, Sherman was fired from the band. Slovak did not actually appear on the self-titled debut album , despite performing and writing the content with the band prior to recording. He was replaced by Jack Sherman for the recording of the album, but returned to the band for second album, Freaky Styley . The third album, Uplift Mofo Party Plan , is in fact the only album to include all four founding members. After this, Slovak overdosed on heroin and was replaced on future albums ( Mother&#x27;s Milk , Blood Sugar Sex Magik - on which Frusciante provides guitars, One Hot Minute - Navarro, Californication and By the Way - Frusciante) Frusciante is also on 2006&#x27;s Stadium Arcadium . Following Slovak&#x27;s death of a heroin overdose, a young John Frusciante took over as guitarist in 1988. Frusciante, however, quit the band in 1992 due in part to his sadness at the band becoming so successful in such a short time; complex personal issues, involving an addiction to heroin, were also a factor. He was then replaced by Arik Marshall. Approximately a year later, Marshall left the band, to be replaced by former Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro. After the release of 1995&#x27;s One Hot Minute, Navarro&#x27;s escalating drug habits became a subject of conflict. In 1998, Navarro was fired from the band, to be taken over by none other than former guitarist, Frusciante, who remained in the band until 2008, when he quietly took his leave on good terms with the other members. Frusciante has also been making solo albums for a number of years. His new album with the band Ataxia came out May 2007, and is titled Automatic Writing II . In 2003 Flea played bass on The Mars Volta&#x27;s album Deloused In The Comatorium . Frusciante added guitar to tracks on Deloused and 2005&#x27;s Frances The Mute . He also played rhythm guitar on The Mars Volta&#x27;s Amputechture . Omar A. Rodriguez-Lopez, guitarist for The Mars Volta, appeared on Stadium Arcadium , playing the solo on &quot;Especially In Michigan&quot;. In 2011, the band released I&#x27;m With You , their tenth studio album, and their first with guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. A new era in the band&#x27;s history took place due Frusciante&#x27;s departure in 2009. He was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who had already played shows as a second guitarist with the band during their 2007 tour dates. ", "King Crimson": "(NOTE: Album covers and band images are not available due to certain legal restrictions imposed on last. fm by King Crimson&#x27;s Management. ) King Crimson are a progressive rock group from London, England, United Kingdom formed in 1968 by guitarist Robert Fripp and drummer Michael Giles. Though originally an all-British musical group, later members have included a number of Americans, most notably Adrian Belew, and Tony Levin. The name &quot;King Crimson&quot; was coined by Peter Sinfield as a synonym for Beelzebub, prince of demons. King Crimson&#x27;s debut album was In the Court of the Crimson King . The first major success of the new genre of progressive rock, many bands that would come to dominate &#x27;prog&#x27; in the 1970s first sought to emulate In the Court of the Crimson King , including Genesis, the Alan Parsons Project, and later Rush. The line-up of King Crimson has at times changed drastically from album to album. Original lead singer and bassist Greg Lake left the group - as did lyricist Peter Sinfield - and went on to fame with Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer in 1970, replaced by Gordon Haskell, Boz Burrell, and, briefly, Jon Anderson of Yes. Also from Yes came drummer Bill Bruford, who joined King Crimson in 1972 and became one of the more enduring members. For the next three years, Bruford and Fripp were joined by future Asia frontman John Wetton. With comparatively few additional musicians, these mid-1970s albums and performances showed a more raw and stylistically focused - though still improvisational - King Crimson. In 1974 the band split temporarily. In 1981, bassist Tony Levin and guitarist/singer Adrian Belew joined Fripp and Bruford in a band initially called Discipline. Changing the name back to King Crimson, the four released a trio of studio albums which preserved the classic heavy and improvisational sound, but also embraced 1980s musical influences and technologies. In 1984 the band split up again, then re-formed in 1994 with former Mr. Mister drummer Pat Mastelotto joining forces with and later replacing Bruford. This lineup included bassist Trey Gunn - playing warr guitar and chapman stick - forming a &quot;double trio&quot; of two guitarists, two bassists and two drummers. In between KC commitments, various combinations of the members convened in different &quot;ProjeKcts&quot;: ProjeKct One, ProjeKct Two, ProjeKct Three, ProjeKct Four, and ProjeKct X, with Robert Fripp describing them as &quot;fraKctals&quot; of the band with the purpose of &quot;research and development&quot;. 2000-2003 saw a new incarnation of King Crimson, without Bruford and Levin, which culminated in the album The Power to Believe and a concert tour. Trey Gunn left the group afterwards, but Fripp and Belew announced that they would meet in 2007 and think about future KC music. Tony Levin agreed to replace Gunn on bass/stick. A new King Crimson line-up was announced in late 2007 and scheduled for rehearsals in 2008, consisting of Fripp, Belew, Mastelotto, Levin, and Gavin Harrison of Porcupine Tree. In August 2008 the band set out on a brief four-city tour in preparation for King Crimson&#x27;s fortieth anniversary in 2009. A short time thereafter, on 20th August 2008, DGMLive (a web medium for Fripp to release live recordings) issued a download-only release of the August 7th, 2008 concert in Chicago. The show reveals a drum-centred direction but the set list, consistent with the rest of the tour, contains no new material or extended improvisation. However, many of the pieces from the back catalogue receive new arrangements, most notably the renditions of &quot;Neurotica,&quot; &quot;Sleepless&quot;, and &quot;Level Five&quot;, all of which are given percussion-heavy overhauls, presumably to highlight the return to the dual-drummer format. More recordings from the New York shows are scheduled for download soon as well. There has been talk of more King Crimson shows in 2009, but nothing definite has arisen yet. In 2008, Steven Wilson began remixing the studio catalogue into 5. 1 Surround Sound for possible future release. Despite its many changes, King Crimson has retained a consistent sound and atmosphere, largely as a result of Fripp&#x27;s signature guitar work. Though they have not had a commercial success since their first album, the band has one of the most devoted followings of any musical group. Their live albums outnumber studio albums by a wide margin (some of them being &quot;official&quot; bootlegs), and there are more than enough ex-members to fully staff the &#x27;classic&#x27; KC revival group known as 21st Century Schizoid Band. On 5 December 2010, Fripp wrote a diary entry on his DGM website outlining his current stage of involvement in the music industry. The diary entry suggested that the King Crimson &quot;switch&quot; had been set to &quot;off&quot; and detailed a number of reasons why he was not currently interested in performing or writing with the band. In spite of this, activity related to the band continues. A separate band based around Jakko Jakszyk and King Crimson alumni Robert Fripp and Mel Collins (who played last with King Crimson on Red) was announced in 2011 as being called &quot;A King Crimson ProjeKct&quot;. Fripp has also referred to it as &quot;P7&quot;. An album A Scarcity of Miracles features these three musicians, along with other Crimson alumni Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison. In an interview with Financial Times published on 3 August 2012, Fripp announced that he was retiring from the music industry, leaving the future of King Crimson uncertain. Fripp&#x27;s retirement lasted for just over a year. On 6 September 2013, Fripp announced King Crimson&#x27;s return to work with a new line-up, stating that &quot;this is a very different reformation to what has gone before: seven players, four English and three American, with three drummers. The Seven-Headed Beast of Crim is in Go! mode&quot;. The current band consists of Fripp, three musicians from the previous 2009 lineup (bassist Tony Levin, drummers Gavin Harrison and Pat Mastelotto) saxophonist/flute player Mel Collins (previously in King Crimson&#x27;s 1971 lineup); and two new recruits, Jakko Jakszyk (vocals, guitar) and Bill Rieflin (drums, ex-REM, Ministry and others). While this lineup has reunited the team which had assembled A Scarcity of Miracles (plus Rieflin), it has not yet been revealed whether the two projects will have much continuity. Fripp has provided some hints as to the musical approach which the new band will take - &quot;The Point Of Crim-Seeing was of a conventional backline - Gavin Harrison, Bill Rieflin, Tony Levin and Pat Mastelotto - reconfigured as the frontline, with Mel Collins, Jakko Jakszyk and myself as backline. &quot; Due to outstanding individual commitments, King Crimson will not be performing live until late 2014 (but will be rehearsing in both full- and small-group formations before then). Fripp has cited several reasons for King Crimson&#x27;s return, varying from the practical (the likely financial settling of his dispute with Universal Music Group, plus imminent completion of his Guitar Circle book and DU Reading Project) to the whimsical: &quot;I was becoming too happy. Time for a pointed stick. &quot;", "Paula Abdul": "Paula Julie Abdul (born June 19, 1962 in San Fernando Valley, California) is a Grammy Award-winning American pop singer, dancer, two-time Emmy Award-winning choreographer, actress, and television personality. In the 1980s, she rose from being a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Lakers NBA basketball team to being a sought-after choreographer at the height of the music video era, then to being a pop-rnb singer with a string of hits in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Notably, Abdul has released three studio albums so far: Forever Your Girl (1988), Spellbound (1991), and Head Over Heels (1995). Subsequent to that, she has for the most part been on a musical hiatus. After her initial period of success, Abdul suffered a series of setbacks in her professional and personal life, until she found renewed fame and success in the 2000s as a celebrity judge on the television series American Idol (2001-2009). In 2011, it was revealed that she would judge on the new show created by former partner in crime Simon Cowell, along with Island Def Jam owner L. A. Reid, and former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger. After the success of the show&#x27;s first season however, Abdul, Scherzinger, and their host Steve Jones were fired by the staff. In 2000, she co-wrote &quot;Spinning Around&quot;, a dance-pop track intended to be the lead single off her new album. The album never materialized and &quot;Spinning Around&quot; was given to Kylie Minogue as a single. The song became highly successful and re-launched Minogue&#x27;s career, as it was intended to do for Abdul, and reached #1 in numerous countries. According to her official website, Abdul is working on a new album that is reportedly scheduled for release by the end of 2008. Her first single from the album Dance Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow was released March 11, 2008 and is also featured as the opening track in the multi-artist compilation album Randy Jackson&#x27;s Music Club, Volume One . Official website: WWW. Paula. com", "The National": "The National is a Brooklyn-based alternative rock band formed in 1999, by friends from Cincinnati, Ohio, USA. The band&#x27;s lyrics are written and sung by Matt Berninger in a distinctive, deep baritone. The rest of the band is composed of two pairs of brothers: Aaron Dessner (guitar, bass, keyboards), Bryce Dessner (guitar), Scott Devendorf (bass, guitar) and Bryan Devendorf (drums). Their self-titled debut album&quot; The National &quot; ( Brassland 2001) was recorded and released before they had played even a single show. They cut the album with engineer Nick Lloyd and formed a label with writer Alec Bemis, so those recordings could be released. Kerrang! magazine gave it four Ks, calling it &quot;the stuff underground legends are made of. &quot; The National made a second album, &quot; Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers &quot; ( Brassland /Talitres 2003). The staff was the same, though Peter Katis, who produced &quot; Turn on The Bright Lights &quot; and &quot; Antics &quot; by Interpol, helped produce and mix, and Australian composer Padma Newsome from Clogs collaborated on arrangements and strings. Following the first session of several for Bernard Lenoir on France&#x27;s Radio Inter, an in-between EP was released, Cherry Tree, containing what would become the blueprint for the sound on their next record and the session of Sad Song&#x27;s standout Murder Me Rachael. After these accolades and being impressed by their live show, Roger Trust signed them to Beggars Banquet. A show at their favorite bar became a van ride to neighboring cities, became a plane ride to Europe, became two summers overseas. Their ties to those good jobs slackened. And they continue on their own path, moving out even further out in Brooklyn to Ditmas Park, where there is space and familiar suburban streets and even Geese on Beverly Road. Their album, &quot; Alligator &quot;, much of which was recorded at their homes in Ditmas Park, was engineered by Paul Mahajan, who has worked with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and TV on the Radio. Padma Newsome camped out for a month with the band, and Peter Katis added more production and mixed the record at his house in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Berninger&#x27;s potent baritone still intones about matters fraught and funny and sad; about record collections, missing persons and medium-sized American hearts. But the record&#x27;s not simply gothic or miserablist &ndash; more like the plays of Tennessee Williams, it&#x27;s full of peculiar intimacies and awkward grace. Alligator&#x27;s heroes are reckless and possessed seducers, but they are apologetic ones. In The National&#x27;s imaginings, in songs alternately lush and spare, there is something twighlit and dreamy worked out in the basement of our brains. &quot;Abel,&quot; &quot;Secret Meeting,&quot; and &quot;Lit Up&quot; were released as singles. On May 22, 2007, The National released their follow-up to Alligator , Boxer, on Beggars Banquet. Taking advantage of the fact that nobody had heard their first album and earliest demos, Matt proceeded to steal lyrics and melodies from them and give them the attention they deserved while keeping the intimacy that made them special. They even managed to convince new friend Sufjan Stevens to lay down some piano tracks for them, and recorded the album in a scant 6 months after coming off the long post-Alligator road. &quot;Mistaken for Strangers&quot;, &quot;Fake Empire&quot; and &quot;Apartment Story&quot; have been released as singles. The band have just finished touring North America and are on a large European autumn/winter tour after playing high slots at several large festivals. In their Dec. 07/Jan. 08 issue, Paste magazine named Boxer best record of 2007. The band&#x27;s fifth album, High Violet, was released on May 10, 2010 by 4AD Records. &quot;Bloodbuzz Ohio&quot;, &quot;Anyone&#x27;s Ghost&quot; and &quot;Terrible Love&quot; were released as singles.

He played in a variety of touring bands, from rock to jazz and classical, and took influence from each situation, learning from the successes and inevitable failures, discovering his musical likes and dislikes. He was finally drawn to study percussion at Boston&#x27;s prestigious Berklee College of Music. He took a keen interest in film, taking time to study it whenever he could to broaden his knowledge of independent and world cinema and filmscore. Through his interests in music and film, Keith developed a sense of space and restraint, which are evident in his musical projects. His primary musical venture is the solo project &#x27;Helios&#x27;, showcasing his skill in percussion, his delicate touch on the guitar, his measured and spacious songwriting, and his self-taught electro-acoustic production. Miami-based label Merck released his first album entitled &#x27;Unomia&#x27; which went on to receive international acclaim. Less than a year after Unomia had hit the shelves, another of Keith&#x27;s projects, &#x27;Goldmund&#x27;, saw the light of day with the release of &#x27;Corduroy Road&#x27;, a selection of solo piano recordings released on the young British label Type Records. This album was also well received internationally, and some of its tracks have been used in films and major television series. June 2006 marked Keith&#x27;s third full-length release on Type Records entitled &#x27;Eingya&#x27;, his most ambitious to date. Taking influence from his interest in cinema, and his extensive European travels, the resulting album is a stunning work of instrumental beauty. The brief but breathtaking &#x27;Ayres&#x27; EP released again on Type Records in 2007 introduces his timid, but very comfortable and intimate vocals for the first time, and marks the addition of yet another brilliant recording to his growing body of cathartic and haunting artistry. His third album Caesura, a return back to the musical landscapes of Eingya, was released on Type in 2008. Keith has also written music for Honda, MTV, Deutsche Telekom, Audi and others, and can be heard on a number of documentaries and films such as Harmony Korine&#x27;s film &quot;Mr. Lonely&quot;.

A synthpop group from the United Kingdom 3. A hardcore punk band from the United States 4. An electronic music group from France 1. Camera Obscura is an indie pop band which formed in 1996 in Glasgow, Scotland. Currently the band consists of Tracyanne Campbell (vocals, guitar), Kenny McKeeve (guitar), Carey Lander (keyboards), Gavin Dunbar (bass) and Lee Thomson (drums). The band was formed in 1996 by Tracyanne Campbell, John Henderson, and Gavin Dunbar and released their debut album Biggest Bluest Hi-Fi in 2001. Camera Obscura released a second album, Underachievers Please Try Harder , the following year, and in September, 2005, the band started recording their next album, named Let&#x27;s Get Out of This Country , with producer Jari Haapalainen. This album was released on June 06, 2006 and appeared high up in many critical lists of the &#x27;best albums of 2006&#x27;. In November 2008, the band announced that they have completed recording the follow-up to Let&#x27;s Get Out of This Country , and that the new album would be released in 2009. In February 2009, it was announced that the band had signed to the label 4AD, who released their fourth album, called My Maudlin Career , on April 20, 2009. http://www. camera-obscura. net/ 2. Camera Obscura comprised Nigel James and Peter Oldroyd, and hailed from the UK. The band formed in 1982 and soldiered through record label hardships until 1987, when they went on indefinite hiatus. 'Destitution' and 'Race in Athens' became the duo's first single on Small Wonder Records in the spring of 1983, followed by 'Village of Stars' b/w 'Insect' for the B-side, in London, at the Atmosphere studios on Wardour Street . These tracks were never released and sadly the masters have not survived. Camera played live extensively at this time and they soldiered on into 1985 with a 4-piece line up (Gary Scargill and Rob Gospel were added) and the Quartet formed Paradise Now in '86. Nigel left in '87 and was replaced by Steve Wright from \"Fiat Lux\". Sadly the band ended there. However, Camera Obscura never officially split up. In 2005, Nigel and Peter dusted off their old material and took to playing shows throughout Europe, finally releasing their lost classic Horizons of Suburbia . All recent Camera Obscura material has been released by German label Anna Louge Records. http://www. annaloguerecords. com/releases. htm http://clancamera. com/ 3. Camera Obscura is not pulling any punches: they&#x27;re out to rock you so hard you fall onto the dance floor. The band launches its aural attack using an arsenal comprised of Michelle Maskovich&#x27;s squealing keyboards, Duane Pitre&#x27;s mountains of guitar squiggle, William Lamb&#x27;s thunderous drums, and Russell White&#x27;s urgent-yet-muffled vocals. Like a dance party during a tornado watch, Camera Obscura throws caution and moderation out the window in favor of thrilling, adventurous sound combinations. Camera Obscura formed in &#x27;98 in San Diego, incorporating members of The Shortwave Channel, The Interstate Ten, and Spanakorzo. The band self-released a seven-inch (now in its fourth pressing on Three One G Records) in October &#x27;98 and went on its first U. S. tour in January &#x27;99. More touring and recording followed, leading up to the release of their first full-length, 2000&#x27;s To Change the Shape of an Envelope, on Troubleman Unlimited. http://www. epitonic. com/index. jsp?refer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww. epitonic. com%2Fartists%2Fcameraobscura. html 4. 1.

", "Justice Civilization": "", "Living Colour": "Living Colour is a funk metal group formed in New York city in 1984. They signed to Epic Records in 1987 and released their first album, Vivid , in 1988. Stylistically their music is a creative fusion influenced by guitar-based rock such as hardcore punk and heavy metal, and traditional African-American music such as jazz, funk, and hip-hop. They are linked to the funk metal/alternative metal movement of the late 1980s typified by bands such as Fishbone, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Primus, Faith No More, and 24-7 Spyz. They are best remembered for the hit Cult of Personality , which won a Grammy Award for best hard rock performance in 1989. They were also named Best New Artist at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards. The singer, Corey Glover, had a role in the movie &#x27;Platoon&#x27;, directed by Oliver Stone. The first two albums bassist Muzz Skillings contributed to the music, before leaving in 1992 due to creative differences. They were inactive from 1995-2000, and since their return have operated as a regular touring unit, as well as releasing one new studio release, Collide0scope , one compilation of b-sides &amp; rarities, and one live album from their early performances at the now mythical CBGB&#x27;s. All four have released solo albums and session work, Doug Wimbish and Will Calhoun also are in both Jungle Funk and Head&gt;&gt;Fake, Corey Glover is also doing musical theatre, Vernon Reid has several projects, and Wimbish also has returned to various projects related to his other longstanding collaborators Adrian Sherwood, Keith LeBlanc, and Skip McDonald. The band released their latest album, The Chair in the Doorway , on September 15, 2009, on Megaforce. ", "Yeah Yeah Yeahs": "Yeah Yeah Yeahs are an American indie rock/post-punk band formed in New York City, New York in the late summer of 2000 by Karen O, born Karen Lee Orzolek (vocals), Nick Zinner (guitar, keyboards) and Brian Chase (drums). The group&#x27;s music melds genres ranging from art punk and garage rock to electronic and new wave. Karen O is known for her screaming, bluesy vocals and energetic stage presence, complemented by her outrageously colorful costumes. Karen O and Brian Chase first met as students at Oberlin College in Ohio in the late 90s, where Chase was a jazz student at the conservatory. Karen then transferred to New York University, and while in New York met Zinner in a local bar, where they formed an &quot;instant connection&quot;. During this time they also shared a loft in Manhattan with future members of the band Metric. The two formed an acoustic duo called Unitard, but they went electric after being inspired by Ohio&#x27;s avant-punk scene. After the drummer they recruited initially bowed out, Chase joined the line-up and decided to form a punk band similar to the &quot;trashy, punky, grimy&quot; art student groups that Karen had left behind in Ohio. The newly band named Yeah Yeah Yeahs wrote a slew of songs at their first rehearsal and soon wound up supporting The Strokes and The White Stripes, earning a significant buzz for their arty and garage punk scene. In 9 July 2001, the band released their debut EP Yeah Yeah Yeahs , which they recorded with Boss Hog&#x27;s Jerry Teel, on their own Shifty label. In 5 November 2002, they released the second EP entitled Machine on Touch and Go label. In 29 April 2003, Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their debut album Fever To Tell on Interscope. This album peaked at #13 on UK albums chart, #55 on Billboard 200 and also received critical acclaim. Fever To Tell was produced by David Sitek (of TV on the Radio) and the band. Four singles were released from this album: &quot;Date with the Night&quot; (14 April 2003 in UK and 21 April 2003 in US; #16 UK), &quot;Pin&quot; (22 July 2003; #29 UK), &quot;Maps&quot; (10 February 2004; #26 UK) and &quot;Y Control&quot; (1 June 2004; #54 UK). &quot;Maps&quot; received significant airplay on alternative radio and it&#x27;s considered their signature song. Fever To Tell was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Music Album and was certified Gold in the UK. The New York Times chose Fever To Tell as the best album of the year. In June 2005, the album was ranked number 89 on Spin magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Albums, 1985-2005. It is also featured in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2009, the album was declared by Rolling Stone, Pitchfork Media, and NME, the 28th, 24th, and 5th best album of the decade, respectively. In October 2004, the group issued the DVD, &quot;Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow&quot; which included a concert filmed at The Fillmore in San Francisco, all of the band&#x27;s music videos to date, and various interviews. In 2005, Karen O collaborated with Kool Keith on the track &quot;Teaser&quot;. For the movie &quot;Jackass 2&quot;, she collaborated with Peaches and Johnny Knoxville to record a track entitled &quot;Backass&quot;. Nick Zinner also plays in Head Wound City, a hardcore supergroup with members of the Blood Brothers and The Locust, and has toured with Bright Eyes for his album, Digital Ash in a Digital Urn. Brian Chase has an active side project in the form of his improvisational band, The Seconds. In 27 March 2006, their sophomore album Show Your Bones , featuring acoustic guitars mixed with their trademark sound, was released on Interscope. This album produced by Squeak E. Clean, David Sitek, YYYs, reached #11 on UK albums chart and #11 on US Billboard 200. Three singles were issued: &quot;Gold Lion&quot; (21 March 2006; #18 UK , #14 Modern Rock), &quot;Turn Into&quot; (19 June 2006; #53 UK) and &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot; (11 September 2006). Show Your Bones was named the second best album of the year by NME magazine, as well as &quot;Cheated Hearts&quot; being voted the 10th best song. Rolling Stone magazine named this album as being the 44th best album of 2006, while Spin magazine ranked it # 31 on their Top 40 Best Albums of 2006. The album was also nominated for a 2007 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Alternative Music Album&quot;. In 2009 Show Your Bones ranked #32 on NME Top 100 Albums of the Decade. In 24 July 2007, Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their third EP, titled Is Is EP . This EP includes 5 songs written in 2004 during the Fever to Tell tour, including the single &quot;Down Boy&quot;. The band also made a live film to accompany the EP, recorded at the Glasslands Gallery in Brooklyn, NY. In 2008 Karen O had begun working on a small side project called Native Korean Rock with fellow NYC musicians. On the collaboration-project N. A. S. A. The Spirit of Apollo, she appears on the track &quot;Strange Enough&quot;, together with Ol&#x27; Dirty Bastard and Fatlip. In the same year, Nick Zinner and Karen O both appeared on the Tiny Masters of Today album, Bang Bang Boom Cake . Karen also directed the video for their song &quot;Hologram World&quot;. The third full-length album It&#x27;s Blitz! was released on Interscope on 9 March 2009 for the digital version and 31 March 2009 for the CD, with an 6 April 2009 release for the rest of the world. The album was produced by the band's long-term producer Dave Sitek, along with Nick Launay and it&#x27;s notable for its mix of indie rock and electronic sound. Three singles were released from this album: &quot;Zero&quot; (24 February 2009; #49 UK, #18 US alternative chart), &quot;Heads Will Roll&quot; (29 June 2009), and &quot;Skeletons&quot; (1 February 2010). It&#x27;s Blitz! was ranked as the third best album of the year 2009 by NME and second best by Spin. Both magazines also listed the song &quot;Zero&quot; as the best of the year. In 2009, Yeah Yeah Yeahs released the compilation iTunes Originals , that consists of live tracks, previously released studio tracks, and interview tracks. Also in 2009, Karen O wrote and performed with Nick Zinner, Brian Chase, Bradford Cox of Deerhunter and Yeah Yeah Yeahs associate Imaad Wasif on the soundtrack of the Spike Jonze&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, credited as Karen O and the Kids. &quot;Where the Wild Things Are OST&quot; was nominated for the &quot;Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media&quot;, a songwriter&#x27;s award, at the 2010 Grammy Awards. ", "Iron & Wine": "Iron &amp; Wine is the stage and recording name of folk rock singer and composer Sam Beam (born July 26, 1974). He currently resides in Dripping Springs, Texas, outside Austin. He has released four studio albums, several EPs and singles, as well as a few download-only releases, which include a live album (a recording of his 2005 Bonnaroo performance). The name Iron &amp; Wine is taken from a dietary supplement named &quot;Beef Iron &amp; Wine&quot; that he found in a general store. Beam was raised outside Columbia, South Carolina, United States where his father worked in land management and his mother was a schoolteacher. He graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree and the Florida State University Film School with an MFA degree. Until the first Iron &amp; Wine album, Beam&#x27;s main source of income was as a professor of film and cinematography at the University of Miami and Miami International University of Art &amp; Design. He had been writing songs for over seven years before a friend lent him a four-track recorder. His friends handed out copies of demos that he had made, and the owner of Sub Pop Records personally contacted Beam and proposed a deal. Beam released his first album, The Creek Drank the Cradle, on the Sub Pop label in 2002; Beam wrote, performed, recorded, and produced every track on the album by himself at a studio in his home. The album features acoustic guitars, banjo, and slide guitar; its music has been compared, variously, to that of Nick Drake, Simon and Garfunkel, Neil Young, Elliott Smith, and Ralph Stanley. In 2003 The Sea &amp; The Rhythm was released, an EP collecting other home-recorded tracks along the same lines as those on the debut. Beam&#x27;s second album, Our Endless Numbered Days (2004), was recorded in a professional studio with a significant increase in fidelity. The focus still lies on acoustic material, but the inclusion of other band members gives rise to a very different sound. Beam released an EP titled Woman King in February 2005, and the EP In the Reins, a collaboration with Calexico was released in September 2005. This joint work mostly features new full-band versions of previously recorded Iron and Wine rarities. One of his most famous songs is a cover, which was featured on a commercial for M&amp;M's candies and in the 2004 film \"Garden State\" (and on its popular soundtrack), of &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; by The Postal Service. &quot;Kiss Each Other Clean&quot; is the fourth studio album by Iron &amp; Wine, released January 25, 2011. The album&#x27;s title is taken from the lyrics of track 10, &quot;Your Fake Name Is Good Enough for Me&quot;. The album marks a further change in style - in an interview with SPIN magazine, Beam said \"It's more of a focused pop record. It sounds like the music people heard in their parent's car growing up. . . that early-to-mid-'70s FM, radio-friendly music. &quot; http://www. ironandwine. com/", "The Cure": "The Cure are a rock band which formed in 1976 in Crawley, England, United Kingdom. The band originally consisted of Robert Smith (vocals, guitar), Porl Thompson (guitar), Michael Dempsey (bass) and Lol Tolhurst (drums), with the band&#x27;s lineup overgoing several changes throughout the years and Smith remaining as the only constant member throughout the band&#x27;s history. The band currently consists of Smith (vocals, guitar), Simon Gallup (bass), Roger O&#x27;Donnell (keyboards), Jason Cooper (drums) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar). The Cure has released 13 studio albums and have sold 27 million albums worldwide and are considered a major influence on alternative rock, goth rock and new wave music. The Cure&#x27;s full lineup history is as follows: Robert Smith (vocals, guitar 1976-present), Lol Tolhurst (drums, keyboards 1976-1989), Michael Dempsey (bass 1976-1979), Porl Thompson (guitar, keyboards 1976-1978, 1983-1992, 2005 -2010), Simon Gallup (bass, keyboards 1979-1982, 1985-present), Matthieu Hartley (keyboards 1979 -1980), Andy Anderson (drums 1983-1984), Phil Thornalley (bass 1983-1984), Boris Williams (drums 1984-1994), Roger O&#x27;Donnell (keyboards 1987 -1990, 1995-2005, 2011-present), Perry Bamonte (guitar, keyboards 1990-2005), Jason Cooper drums 1995-present) and Reeves Gabrels (guitar 2012-present) Just as the group&#x27;s lineup has changed, the band&#x27;s sound has evolved throughout the years, starting off as a post-punk band similar to Wire and Gang of Four before morphing into a gothic rock band in the early 80&#x27;s, to a synthpop group in the mid-80&#x27;s and a power-pop-alternative band in the early 90&#x27;s. The Cure has always been an alternative and very independent band which was evident from the early days. Shunning the anarchistic tendencies of many punk bands after their formation in 1976 , The Cure &#x27;s first release was Killing an Arab, based on material from French writer Albert Camus&#x27; &quot;L&#x27;Etranger&quot; (translated into English as The Stranger or The Outsider ). This track courted controversy because of its theme (misinterpreted as racist, it was in fact, about the futility of killing any ethnicity), but it started to secure a small following, which grew following the release of debut album Three Imaginary Boys and non-LP single Boys Don&#x27;t Cry in 1979, the latter of which would become one of The Cure &#x27;s most famous songs. At that time, The Cure embarked on tour as the support for Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees&#x27; Join Hands Tour. After the sudden departure of guitarist John McKay, Robert was recruited as guitarist for the Banshees as the band &#x27;felt he was the only person capable of taking on the task. &#x27; As a result, Robert completed the tour playing two sets a night with The Cure and Siouxsie and the Banshees. Following this, The Cure moved from their punk leanings into the portentous post-punk territory, releasing three albums of doom-laden rock in three years, Seventeen Seconds, Faith and Pornography, the latter of which charted inside the UK top 10, though the band were repeatedly dogged by the &quot;Second-class Joy Division&quot; tag. Following their third set of line-up changes, the group released Japanese Whispers, a compilation of three singles and their b-sides. Through their desire to escape the Joy Division description, the singles were a poppier effort, featuring danceable tracks like Let&#x27;s Go To Bed alongside pop songs like Love Cats. Following the commercial disappointment of follow-up album The Top in 1984, The Cure returned to form with 1985&#x27;s The Head On The Door. Featuring the singles In Between Days and Close To Me, The Head on the Door was distant from the band&#x27;s punk roots, having more in common with successful alternative bands like The Smiths and Echo &amp; The Bunnymen than their gloomier roots. Two years later, the eighth studio album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me was a more stadium-sized effort, though featuring audacious pop songs like Why Can&#x27;t I Be You, it was seemingly caught between two styles. However, it was the band&#x27;s ninth effort (following the departure of last surviving founder member other than Robert Smith, Lol Tolhurst), Disintegration, that would be their greatest success, both critically and commercially. Disintegration spawned hit singles like Lullaby (no. 5 in the UK), Love Song (an impressive no. 2 in the USA), Pictures of You, and Fascination Street. The album itself was a culmination of The Cure &#x27;s directions through the eighties, featuring the poppier side combined with the more tender aspects, as well as the gloomier facets. Following this, a remix compilation named Mixed Up was released in 1990, featuring one new track, Never Enough, and two years later tenth studio album Wish surfaced, which was a hit mainly from the momentum gained by Disintegration, though it also featured their most famous pop song, Friday I&#x27;m In Love (no. 6 in the UK and no. 18 in the US). During the years following this, the band became distracted and discouraged by the lawsuit launched by former member Lol Tolhurst, who felt he had been deprived of royalties. As a result, the 1996 album Wild Mood Swings felt unfocused, and was a critical and commercial failure, though the single Mint Car was a moderate hit. In 1997, The Cure released the compilation Galore, featuring new song Wrong Number. Three years later, at the release of original album Bloodflowers, Robert Smith announced it would be the last album for the band, the album itself being a return to the gloomier rock of Pornography and Faith. Resultantly, another hits compilation was released in 2001. However, in 2004, the band surprised all by returning with a self-titled album, their twelfth studio album, which was a surprise hit, reaching the US Top 10, its lead single - The End of the World - becoming a modest hit on Modern Rock radio, and receiving a relatively warm reception from the press. In May 2005, Smith fired Roger O&#x27;Donnell and Perry Bamonte from the band, along with Bamonte&#x27;s brother Daryl, who had been The Cure&#x27;s tour manager for many years. The remaining members of the band (Robert Smith, longtime bassist Simon Gallup and Jason Cooper) made a few appearances as a trio before it was announced that founding member Porl Thompson would be returning to The Cure . In early 2007 the band toured Asia and Oceania, but a planned North American tour in Autumn 2007 was delayed until Spring 2008 so the band could continue recording their next album. The band released their thirteenth album 4:13 Dream on 27 October 2008. Four singles and a remix EP called &quot;Hypnagogic States&quot; were releases on the 13th of each month preceding the album&#x27;s release. In 2009, Robert Smith won the Godlike Genius award at the NME Awards. On April 19, 2009, the band performed at the Coachella Festival in California. During 2010, Robert Smith contributed songs to the soundtrack of the Tim Burton film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and provided guest vocals on the songs &quot;Not in Love&quot; by Crystal Castles and &quot;Come to Me&quot; by 65daysofstatic. Between 31 May 2011 and 1 June 2011, the band performed three concerts at the Sydney Opera House performing the entirety of one of their first three albums on each night. Porl Thompson did not perform with the band at any of the concerts, but Roger O&#x27;Donnell performed with the band for the &quot;Seventeen Seconds&quot; and &quot;Faith&quot; concerts, and co-founding member Lol Tulhurst performed with the band for the first time since 1988 for the &quot;Faith&quot; concert. As of 2011, O&#x27;Donnell has returned to the lineup officially. In 2012, the band added former Tin Machine guitarist Reeves Gabrels to the lineup. In 2013 The Cure started The Great Circle Tour, headlinig festivals in Japn, South Korea and North America. In 2014 Robert Smith announced the upcoming release of a new album, to be called 4:14 Scream, featuring 14 songs recorded during the 4:13 Dream sessions and also an accompanying double album 4:26 Dream containing all the tracks from those sessions.

Born Ella McMahon, she grew up in West London. Eyre trained as a competitive swimmer before singing, and was discovered while at the BRIT school studying Performing Arts &amp; Technology. In July 2012, she published to Warner/Chappell and scored a record deal with Virgin/EMI shortly thereafter. Eyre became known for featuring on Rudimental&#x27;s UK #1 single Waiting All Night (feat.

", "Hurts": "There are multiple artists named &quot;Hurts&quot; Manchester, UK electro-pop duo Theo Hutchcraft and Adam Anderson. Formed in 2009, elegant and enigmatic HURTS have their sharp suits, slick hair and stark visuals. Theo and Adam present a striking contrast to the glow-in-the-dark pop stars who have run amok across the charts of late. Looking like they would rather be on the cover of Vogue Hommes than NME or Smash Hits, the pair resemble Tears For Fears as shot by Anton Corbijn. Hurts have recently released their first single &quot;Better Than Love&quot; and toured the UK and Europe during the summer of 2010. Before HURTS, singer Theo and synthesiser Adam were in bands Bureau and Daggers, the latter of which supported Gary Numan. However, on a trip to Italy, they discovered &quot;disco-lento&quot; (slow disco) and became fixed on a more austere, and stylish, European aesthetic and Hurts was born. Musically, they construct melancholic 1980s-inspired electro-pop with songs that they say are inspired by the British mentality of being &quot;not too bad&quot;. &quot;How are you doing? Not too bad. For a while you think that&#x27;s not very interesting,&quot; Theo once said. &quot;But it can be very interesting because it&#x27;s on a knife-edge of hope and despair. &quot; In August of 2010, Hurts&#x27; debut full-length album, Happiness, debuted at number four on the U. K. albums chart, selling over 25,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest selling album by a band in the U. K. that year. Featuring the singles &quot;Better Than Love,&quot; &quot;Wonderful Life,&quot; and &quot;Stay,&quot; among others, the album was huge success across Europe and Hurts&#x27; profile rose exponentially. Several accolades followed in 2010 including topping the BBC&#x27;s Sound of 2010 poll, winning a German BAMBI award, and garnering an MTV Europe Music Award nomination. The following year, Hurts earned more public support after a playing a high-profile slot at the Glastonbury Festival. The performance was well-received and was even voted best of the festival by NME readers. Also that year, the band headlined their first European tour which culminated with a concert at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy with special guest Kylie Minogue. In December of 2012, in anticipation of the band&#x27;s next album and in keeping with the band's tradition of releasing stylish, immaculately directed videos, Hurts released a long-form promotional video for the song &quot;The Road,&quot; which itself was inspired by Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel of the same name and J. G. Ballard&#x27;s novel Crash. Hurts followed up in 2013 by releasing their sophomore album, Exile. Featuring production from Hutchcraft and Anderson, along with Quant and Dan Grech-Marguerat, Exile showcased a nuanced, somewhat more contemporary sound that incorporated more orchestral and rock instrumentation, yet retained all of Hurts&#x27; core new wave and Krautrock influences. ", "Limp Bizkit": "Limp Bizkit is an American nu metal band from Jacksonville, Florida. The band&#x27;s line-up consists of Fred Durst (lead vocals), Wes Borland (guitar), Sam Rivers (bass), John Otto (drums) and DJ Lethal. Limp Bizkit has been nominated for three Grammy Awards and have won several other major awards. The band has sold an estimated 35 million albums worldwide. Formed in 1995, the band achieved mainstream success with their second studio album, Significant Other, released in 1999. Their third studio album, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water, released in 2000, continued the band&#x27;s success. The album sold 1. 05 million copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling rock album ever, breaking the record held for 7 years by Pearl Jam&#x27;s Vs. Mike Smith was brought in as a replacement guitarist, following the departure of Wes Borland in 2001, for the fourth studio album, Results May Vary, released in 2003. Borland rejoined the band in 2004 for the release of an EP, The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) but departed again. He rejoined the band in February 2009. With Borland, Limp Bizkit recorded their first full length album with their original line-up in ten years, Gold Cobra. Formation and early years (1995-1996) Limp Bizkit was founded in 1995 in Jacksonville, after Fred Durst met Sam Rivers. Rivers introduced Durst to his cousin, John Otto, a drummer in Keystone Heights, FL. The three got together for a jam session, and soon after started an early version of the band. The trio soon recruited guitarist Rob Waters and Limp Bizkit was established. The band&#x27;s first four-track demo, entitled Mental Aquaducts (which were remakes of previously written songs from Fred&#x27;s previous bands Split 26 and 10Ft Shindig), was recorded with Rob Waters but soon after he left the band. Otto suggested the group to consider Wes Borland, whom he had gone to school with, for the now vacant position. Durst noticed him playing in clubs and wanted to recruit him. Durst went to Philadelphia, and he instructed the other members to talk to Wes and see if he&#x27;d join the band. Wes accepted, and the very night Fred came back to Jacksonville, a show was scheduled. Fred and Wes met for the first time, practiced for a half hour, and then went and played the show. The band continued to play various shows, their most popular venue being at the Milkbar in Jacksonville. In 1995, Fred Durst met and talked to members of the band Korn when they played a show in the Jacksonville area. Durst, a tattoo artist, gave Korn bassist Reginald &quot;Fieldy&quot; Arvizu several tattoos and the two became friends. Durst gave Korn the band&#x27;s first demo tape with Rob Waters, and they shrugged it off as nothing special. Later, with Borland, a second demo was recorded and this time Korn were impressed. The demo included the tracks &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, &quot;Stuck&quot;, &quot;Stalemate&quot;, and &quot;Pollution&quot;, all of which would end up on the band&#x27;s debut album Three Dollar Bill, Yall$. The demo tape was passed onto Ross Robinson, who produced for Korn, and he was also impressed. Ross contacted Limp Bizkit, and stated his intent to produce for the band. At a Garbage concert, Durst had met Jordan Schur and played his demo tape for him in Schur&#x27;s car. He was impressed, and wanted to sign Limp Bizkit to his label, Flip Records. Around this time, the band was booked to tour with the bands Deftones and House of Pain, whose member DJ Lethal later joined Limp Bizkit. Limp Bizkit later signed with Mojo Records, but were later bought out by Schur and subsequently signed with Flip Records. Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all$ (1997-1998) The band&#x27;s first full length recording, Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, was released in 1997 on Interscope. The album fared poorly on the Billboard 200 at the time of its release, although it did sell steadily over time due to extensive touring. It wasn&#x27;t until the Family Values Tour, the Trail of Tears, and Ozzfest, which helped the album to peak at number 22 on the chart. At Ozzfest in particular, the band made a memorable impression on viewers due to the original set they played on, which consisted of a giant toilet. The band climbed out from the toilet at the beginning of the show, with Durst saying lines during the show such as &quot;We&#x27;re coming straight to you from the sewer&quot; and &quot;I am a piece of shit, and my band is a piece of shit&quot;. Borland&#x27;s outlandish makeup started making impressions on fans as well. Although their first released single was &quot;Counterfeit&quot;, they rose to fame through a cover of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot;. The song appeared on the soundtrack of Peter Berg&#x27;s 1998 movie &quot;Very Bad Things&quot; starring Cameron Diaz, Christian Slater and Jeremy Piven. Later that year, Fred lent his vocals to Korn&#x27;s third album on the song All in the Family, a rap-battle of sorts. The album featured a second disc, with four remixes of the demo for the song and multimedia featuring interviews between Durst, Borland and the rest of Korn. Another unique idea the band came up with was the Ladies Night in Cambodia tour. Fred had noticed that mostly young males went to their concerts, and wanted more women to come, so they let women in for free at this tour. The tour was a huge success, and many more women would appear at their future concerts. Significant Other (1999-2000) In 1999, Limp Bizkit found major worldwide success with their second album Significant Other, which debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 and received mostly positive reviews. The album sold 834,000 copies in its first week and has sold over 16 million copies worldwide. The first single &quot;Nookie&quot;, was an enormous hit on rock radio, reaching the top 10 in both rock and rap charts. The band followed-up the single with three simultaneously released singles - &quot;Break Stuff&quot;, &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; and &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; (featuring hip-hop artist Method Man). &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot; has been cited as an example of Fred Durst&#x27;s attempt to work for unity rather than rivalry between rock and hip-hop, blurring the distinction between the two genres of music. The album features the songs &quot;Nobody Like You&quot; with vocals by Jonathan Davis of Korn and Scott Weiland of Stone Temple Pilots and &quot;No Sex&quot; with vocals by Aaron Lewis of Staind. In the summer of 1999, Limp Bizkit played at the highly anticipated Woodstock &#x27;99 show in front of approximately 200,000 people. Violent action sprang up during and after their performance, including fans tearing plywood from the walls during a performance of the song &quot;Break Stuff&quot;. Several sexual assaults that included, but were not limited to, rapes were reported in the aftermath of the concert, with some examples of the latter being caught on tape, resulting in deliberately lit fires and looting when the Red Hot Chili Peppers played the next day. Some have blamed the band for this outbreak, although Fred Durst claimed that none of the instigations he had made at the concert were intended to cause damage. Along with this episode, controversies involving the band&#x27;s members began to arise. Durst particularly became involved in feuds with the metal band Slipknot , Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s guitarist Zakk Wylde and engaged in physical violence with Creed frontman Scott Stapp. The band feuded with rappers Eminem and Everlast, while Taproot released on their website an answering machine message that Durst had left on their lead singer&#x27;s phone as &quot;revenge&quot; for ending their record company contract with his record label. Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000-2001) Fifteen months later, Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water was released on October 17, 2000. In an interview with Guitar World, guitarist Wes Borland explained the meaning of the album&#x27;s strange title. He said that Durst was frequently referred to as an asshole and thus called himself the &quot;chocolate starfish&quot;. The other line in the album&#x27;s title, &quot;hot dog flavored water&quot; was derived from an inside joke about a gas station the band visited while on the road and witnessed varieties of flavored water on display. The album set a record for highest week-one sales of a rock album with just over one million copies sold in the U. S. in its first week of release, with 400,000 of those sales coming at its first day of release. &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; was certified Gold, Platinum and six times Multi-Platinum. The first two singles &quot;My Generation&quot; and &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; were released at the same time in promotion of the album. &quot;Take a Look Around&quot; was later added to the list as the theme song to the movie Mission: Impossible 2. A remix, &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Urban Assault Vehicle)&quot; featuring Method Man, Redman and DMX was a minor club hit and was featured in the movie The Fast and the Furious. The fourth single &quot;My Way&quot; was commissioned as the opening theme for the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s WrestleMania X-Seven, and &quot;Rollin&#x27; (Air Raid Vehicle)&quot; was used as the entrance music for wrestler &quot;The Undertaker&quot; from 2000-2002. The album received mixed reviews from many critics. Controversy continued with a death during a 2001 tour of Australia at the Big Day Out festival in Sydney. Teenager Jessica Michalik died of asphyxiation when fans rushed the stage in the mosh pit. It was claimed by security and witnesses that Fred Durst was urging the crowd on in a possibly violent manner, and that he failed to attempt to calm the crowd after the accident. Michalik was later rushed to Sydney&#x27;s Concord Hospital where she died six days later. Durst provided the courts with testimony. During the hearing he claimed, via a video connection from the U. S. , that he had warned the concert&#x27;s organizers Aaron Jackson, Will Pearce and Amar Tailor and promoter Vivian Lees of the potential dangers of such minimal security, even going so far as to say Limp Bizkit would &quot;pull out&quot; if the issue wasn&#x27;t properly addressed. Big Day Out attorneys attempted to pin the blame on Limp Bizkit because the band did not stop playing when they received news of the incident. Although the guitars, drums and bass ceased, DJ Lethal played a quiet computer-generated loop. While admitting that Lethal took it upon himself to play the interlude, Durst claimed that the quiet melody did have a soothing effect on the crowd. The Coroner&#x27;s Court decided that, while the band could have been more helpful in efforts to aid the girl, the security practices employed by festival organizers Creative Entertainment Australia bore the brunt of the blame. After viewing videotapes and hearing witness testimony, however, Milledge, the coroner, said it was evident that the density of the crowd was dangerous at the time Limp Bizkit took the stage- therefore they had to erect a cage around the band. In the fall of 2001, Wes Borland left Limp Bizkit for the first time. Strained relations between him and Durst contributed to his decision. His departure was interpreted as a major blow by fans and critics to the band. He was often cited as a vital creative force in the group, due in part to his eccentricity. The last known song the band was working on with Wes was &quot;Relax&quot;, a semi-cover take on Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s song, due to be on the Zoolander soundtrack. Results May Vary (2002-2004) With Borland&#x27;s absence, Limp Bizkit began a nation-wide audition for their new guitarist called Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is in 2002. Durst announced at the outset that he was interested in recruiting a female or more than one new member into the band. Thousands of hopefuls were said entered. Some controversy occurred when rumors surfaced that all contestants were required to sign a document giving Limp Bizkit the full ownership of any riffs they played. Each auditioner was allowed only sixty seconds in the first round. The final contestants were Monte Pittman, Anoush Saboktakin and Jonas Anderson of Fresno, California. On March 30, 2003, Limp Bizkit performed live for the first time in two years, at World Wrestling Entertainment&#x27;s WrestleMania XIX. They played &quot;Crack Addict&quot; and &quot;Rollin&quot; (The Undertaker&#x27;s theme song) at the show. They signed up for several live tours, despite their lack of a guitarist. It was revealed that the guitarists for the WrestleMania show were Head from Korn and Mike Smith from Snot. During this time, Durst spoke of many collaborations with guitarists, with a few rap guests sprinkled in on songs for the album. Among them were Rivers Cuomo of Weezer, Page Hamilton of Helmet, Al Jourgensen of Ministry, and Head of Korn as well as Jay-Z, Bubba Sparxxx, and Snoop Dogg. None of the songs with those guitarists would make it onto the album, except &quot;Build a Bridge&quot;, which was written with Welch, and &quot;Red Light - Green Light&quot;, which featured Snoop Dogg. The finalists from the &quot;Put Your Guitar Where Your Mouth Is&quot; contest were rejected in favor of former Snot guitarist Mike Smith. The band changed its logo to &quot;limpbizkit&quot; to promote their change of style. The band had already recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material for an upcoming release. But with Mike Smith now in the band, it was decided that they would go back in the studio and record another album&#x27;s worth of songs. The best of these tracks would make it onto the final release. Fred refers to the tracks recorded during this period that didn&#x27;t make it to the album as the &#x27;Off the Record&#x27; tracks, as if it were an album in itself. On September 23, 2003, Results May Vary, their fourth album, debuted at #3 with roughly 320,000 copies sold, breaking the group&#x27;s #1 spree on the Billboard 200. It received platinum certification (1 million copies sold) in the United States in 2008, almost 5 years after its release. In comparison, their previous work Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water sold more than one million albums in its first week. The album received almost uniformly poor reviews by critics. Although Rolling Stone&#x27;s review gave 3 out of 5 stars, Playlouder called it &#x27;fucking crap&#x27;, and Yahoo! Launch labeled it &#x27;a frightening insight into the vacuous state of 21st century culture&#x27;. Nevertheless, an acoustic cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot; was a moderate hit on mainstream radio, and its video featured actress Halle Berry. &quot;Eat You Alive&quot; was released as the first single off the album, cracking the top 20 of both American rock charts with an accompanying video that features actress Thora Birch being berated and actor Bill Paxton as her father who is looking for her. The album&#x27;s ballad &quot;Build a Bridge&quot; was the official theme song of WWE&#x27;s Survivor Series pay-per-view event in November 2003, although it was never released as an official single due to Mike Smith&#x27;s departure. Another song from the album, &quot;Almost Over&quot;, cracked the Rock Top 40. However it was never released as a single or video. In 2003, Limp Bizkit toured on the Summer Sanitarium Tour with headliners Metallica, along with Linkin Park, Deftones and Mudvayne to promote Metallica&#x27;s 2003 release, St. Anger. At the tour&#x27;s stop in Chicago, IL, attendees of the concert threw items at and heckled Durst from the moment he walked on stage. With the crowd chanting &quot;Fuck Fred Durst&quot; and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. Borland&#x27;s second departure, and hiatus (2004-2008) Throughout July 2004, various rumors began circulating claiming that guitarist Wes Borland had been playing with the band again. By July 8, a fan site released an official report that Borland was recording with the band in London. Photos appeared on the band&#x27;s official website of him playing with the band, and a live video of them playing a new song &quot;The Truth&quot; in studio was posted on the website. Durst said of Borland&#x27;s re-entry, &quot;We are very content with Mike being gone. We are the type of people that stay true to our family and our instincts and at any moment will act on intuition as a whole. Mike wasn&#x27;t the guy. We had fun playing with him, but always knew, in the back of our minds, that he wasn&#x27;t where we needed him to be mentally. &quot; At this stage, they reverted back to the use of their original logo. The band returned to the studio with producer Ross Robinson, who had worked with them on Three Dollar Bill, Yall$, to create a seven track EP titled The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1). Drummer John Otto was only able to contribute to one track on the album due to personal matters, with Sammy Siegler providing percussion on the remaining tracks. Durst promised fans before its release that it would be a return to the &#x27;rawer, more abrasive style&#x27; of their first album. The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) was released as a 7-track EP internationally on May 3, 2005 with little fanfare or advertising, debuting at number 24 on the Billboard 200 and selling only 37,000 copies in its first week. It has sold just slightly over 100,000 in the US. It received mediocre reviews, with some critics thinking that Durst was trying too hard to imitate Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s lead singer Zack de la Rocha. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s first greatest hits compilation was released on November 8, 2005. It contains material from the band&#x27;s first four albums. An additional DVD was released in conjunction with the compilation. The album and DVD were barely promoted by the band&#x27;s label, even to the point where Durst claimed he was being forced to do interviews about a compilation he wasn&#x27;t very excited about. The promotion did not pay off, with the album debuting at number 47. Wes Borland stated that the release was &quot;a piece of shit and a waste of money. &quot; After the release of Greatest Hitz and the departure of Wes Borland the band unofficially went into a hiatus. Durst began directing and acting in films such as Population 436 and The Longshots. Otto went into rehab and collaborated with other bands and artists, as did the rest of the band (Rivers, DJ Lethal). Rock im Park 2001 was released on March 31, 2008. The live album and DVD documented their 2001 performance at Rock im Park in 2001. It documents the band at the height of their popularity. Reunion and Unicorns N&#x27; Rainbows Tour (2008-2009) In mid-2008 rumors began to indicate that Limp Bizkit were planning a comeback tour, these rumors were later confirmed. Interviews with various members of the band had hinted that Terry Balsamo was to replace Wes Borland, but Balsamo was demanding a written contract, which the band was either unable or unwilling to give. Despite no official confirmation from the band, members of Limp Bizkit signed up on Twitter including Wes, with DJ Lethal confirming the accounts to be real, making Borland&#x27;s rejoining seem less like a rumor. In late 2008, bassist Sam Rivers hinted that the group was in the early stages of writing new material for the fifth full-length album, the bands first full-length album in 6 years. On February 11, 2009, Durst posted on his Twitter account the message &quot;1am pacific time- limpbizkit. com tonight&quot;. The site was up and running for the first time in years and confirmed the return of Wes. Through a blog post on the homepage, Fred Durst and Wes Borland issued a joint statement: \"We decided we were more disgusted and bored with the state of heavy popular music than we were with each other. Regardless of where our separate paths have taken us, we recognize there is a powerful and unique energy with this particular group of people we have not found anywhere else. This is why Limp Bizkit is back. \" On May 20, 2009 the original lineup of Limp Bizkit performed together for the first time in eight years, at their first show ever in Latvia. The band went on to play a European tour named Unicorns N&#x27; Rainbows Tour. They also played German festivals Rock Im Park and Rock Am Ring on June 5 and 7 respectively, headlining the latter. Five days later the band landed in the UK and played at Download Festival. On August 1, the band took stage for a sold-out show in London&#x27;s HMV Forum as part of Kerrang&#x27;s Week of Rock. Limp Bizkit was officially inducted into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame at the Kerrang! Awards, and the next day the band performed at the Sonisphere Festival, playing in between Machine Head and Nine Inch Nails. Less than two weeks later, Limp would again be playing alongside Nine Inch Nails, but also Keane in ETPFest, Korea, on August 15. August 24, 2009 marked the official first day of recording new material, as well as the first time the entire band had recorded together since 2000 (Results May Vary without Wes Borland, The Unquestionable Truth Part 1 without John Otto). Gold Cobra and recent events (2010-present) On November 30, 2009 Durst revealed in a Kerrang! article that the new album would be titled Gold Cobra and would be released early 2010 (though later delayed) through Interscope. Durst told Kerrang Magazine in December 2009 that the album will feature 10 songs with interludes/segues between the songs. In a series of radio interviews Fred revealed that Wes Borland came up with the album name &quot;Gold Cobra&quot;. Regarding the albums first single, Durst stated &quot;We are getting a little grief from the big wigs as to what single &quot;they&quot; want out first. Obviously &quot;we&quot; are pushing for &quot;Douchebag&quot;. If they choose to run with something else we will figure out a way to release it anyway. &quot; On March 29 Durst stated that eighteen songs are recorded and are currently in the process of being mixed, but noted that not all songs will make the album. Guest performances on the album include Mathematics, Raekwon (Wu-Tang Clan), Gene Simmons, and Paul Wall. After the recording of Gold Cobra, Limp Bizkit performed a number of U. S. concerts including 98 Rock Fest, Rock on the Range, Beale Street Music Festival, EdgeFest 20, and Buzzfest. On May 10 the band performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Following the festival shows, the band was scheduled to embark on a full U. S. tour in July, but was postponed to fall 2010 due to the bands desire to play arenas instead of amphitheaters. Starting in August and into the fall the band performed a full European tour. The band was also scheduled for a South American tour, but was canceled due to a neck injury sustained by Fred Durst while performing in Warsaw, Poland. On April 30, 2010, Durst posted the song &quot;Why Try&quot; via the band&#x27;s official website. Due to delays, Durst decided to post a second song on August 7, 2010 for fans waiting for Gold Cobra, titled &quot;Walking Away&quot; through a blog on their official site. On february 9th, Fred Durst posted on twitter: Limp Bizkit Gold Cobra should be mixed and ready to press by the end of February. The day after,on the band&#x27;s website,Durst wrote: &quot;As we head towards the end of February 2011 the realities of having a completed album to expose are finally here. Through thick and thin, the Gold Cobra has slivered its way through the corporate jungle and into the studio to be mixed by Dave Schiffman. My intentions are to keep as much &quot;polish&quot; off of this album as possible. I have had many discussions with Dave as he&#x27;s been on the cobra since the beginning and knows exactly the sound I am looking for regarding the mix. We are extremely excited to get this album into your eardrums. As some of you have noticed, we have and will take as much time as we need before putting this album out regardless of any pressure or impatience that is thrown our way. So, waste your breath if you like. Its your prerogative. -fd&quot; It was also announced on the 15th of February that Limp Bizkit will perform on the sunday at Sonisphere festival in Knebworth. http://www. limpbizkit. com Discography: 1. - Three Dollar Bill, Y&#x27;all$ (1997) 2. - Significant Other (1999) 3. - Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000) 4. - Results May Vary (2003) 5. - The Unquestionable Truth (Part 1) (2005) 6. - Gold Cobra (2011) 7. - Stampede of the Disco Elephants (2014)", "Metallica": "Metallica is an American metal band formed in 1981 in Los Angeles, California, United States when drummer Lars Ulrich posted an advertisement in The Recycler. Metallica's line-up originally consisted of Ulrich, rhythm guitarist and vocalist James Hetfield, and lead guitarist Dave Mustaine. Mustaine was later fired due to problems with alcoholism and drug addiction - he went on to form the band Megadeth. Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammett took his place. Metallica has been through several bassists, including Ron McGovney, Cliff Burton (who died in a bus crash while the band was on tour), and Jason Newsted. The current bassist is Robert Trujillo, who joined in 2003. Metallica's early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the \"big four\" of the thrash metal sub-genre alongside Slayer, Megadeth, and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community and critical acclaim, with the 1986 release Master of Puppets described as one of the most influential and \"heavy\" metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with Metallica (1991), which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. With this release the band expanded its musical direction resulting in an album that appealed to a more mainstream audience. In 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without the band members' consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger alienated many fans with the exclusion of guitar solos and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger. Metallica has released nine studio albums, two live albums, two EPs, twenty-two music videos, and forty-four singles. The band has won nine Grammy Awards, and has had five consecutive albums debut at number one on the Billboard 200, making Metallica the only band ever to do so. The band's 1991 album, Metallica, has sold over 15 million copies in the United States, and 22 million copies worldwide, which makes it the 25th-highest-selling album in the country. The band has sold an estimated 100 million records worldwide as of the release of their latest album Death Magnetic. As of September 2008, Metallica is the fourth highest-selling music artist since the SoundScan era began tracking sales on May 25, 1991, selling a total of 51,136,000 albums in the United States alone. Metallica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2009. Metallica organised a brand new festival. They called it Sonishpere. Several cities in Europe were chosen by the band. On June 15, 2011, Metallica announced that recording sessions with singer-songwriter Lou Reed had concluded. The album, titled Lulu, was recorded over several months, and resulted in ten songs based on Frank Wedekind&#x27;s &quot;Lulu&quot; plays, Earth Spirit and Pandora&#x27;s Box. The album was released on October 31, 2011. The recording of the album was problematic at times, with Lars Ulrich later stating Lou Reed challenged him to a &quot;street fight&quot;. On October 16, 2011, Robert Trujillo confirmed that the band was back in the studio and writing new material, stating, &quot;The writing process for the new Metallica album has begun. We&#x27;ve been in the studio with Rick Rubin, working on a couple of things, and we&#x27;re going to be recording during the most of next year. &quot; Current members: James Hetfield - lead vocals, rhythm guitar (1981-present) Lars Ulrich - drums, percussion (1981-present) Kirk Hammett - lead guitar, backing vocals (1983-present) Robert Trujillo - bass, backing vocals (2003-present). Former members: Ron McGovney- bass (1982) Dave Mustaine - lead guitar, backing vocals (1982-1983) Cliff Burton - bass, backing vocals (1982-1986) Jason Newsted - bass, backing vocals (1986-2001). ", "Amorphis": "Amorphis is a Finnish progressive/melodic metal band, and formerly death/doom band started by Jan Rechberger, Tomi Koivusaari and Esa Holopainen in Helsinki, Finland in 1990. Amorphis absorbed and incorporated influences from many metal genres, and with time passing their sound evolved dramatically. Initially, the band was a Death Metal act, but with time they have evolved into making music that is more classifiable as Doom Metal with folk influences, and, more recently, Progressive Metal and Hard Rock, utilizing increasingly complex arrangements and a less brutal sound. Amorphis is also well known for their use of the Finnish national epic, the Kalevala, as a source for their lyrics. In 1989 Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen played in a speed metal band Violent Solution, which Tomi Koivusaari had left the previous year to form the death metal band Abhorrence. Violent Solution slowly withered away as the musicians became interested in other things and styles of music. At this point, Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen had the idea of putting together a death metal band. In early 1990, Tomi Koivusaari was asked to be the vocalist and Oppu Laine to be their bassist. During that time the band asked Tomi to pick up the slot of rhythm guitarist as well as singing, which led to the band dumping all original compositions and starting again. With the band starting to move along, Tomi&#x27;s other band (Abhorrence) split up and he found himself with much more time to put into Amorphis. The band went into gear and started churning out new brutal music. Shortly after the band had recorded their first studio demo tape, Tomi got a letter from Relapse Records offering Abhorrence a recording contract. Since Abhorrence was no longer active, they quickly sent their own demo in the return mail and eventually got signed to a recording deal. The deal would later almost destroy the band, due a very long commitment and poor artist relations. They quickly released a death metal classic Karelian Isthmus and would later release the original demo as the Privilege Of Evil EP. The EP featured Abhorrence&#x27;s original vocalist, Jukka Kolehmainen, as a vocalist on the Abhorrence cover song Vulgar Necrolatry. The band quickly adopted new ways of making music and started incorporating different styles in with the original death metal aspect, creating a very unique and complex soundscape. Their musical growth has not stopped and the band consistently strives to excel in the creativity and unique soundscapes which has always been the band&#x27;s backbone. Eclipse, is the result of this uncompromising attitude and while the band sheds their musical skin, the fans can rest assured that the direction of the music is still in the same distant horizon as it was when they went in to studio to records Tales from the Thousand Lakes. Amorphis&#x27; eighth release was Silent Waters, which was released in 2007 and continued in similiar vein with Eclipse. Again based on Kalevala, the album tells the story of Lemminkainen. Skyforger was released in May 27 2009, and it contains 10 songs. The digipack version has one bonus song; Godlike Machine. Forging The Land Of Thousand Lakes was released in July 2010. It is available as a 2 DVD &amp; 2 CD package (2 digipacks in a box) or as a 2 DVD set. DVD 1, and the CDs, contain a live concert in Oulu (Finland) in 2009. The second DVD contains a shorter set from Summer Breeze Open Air 2009, a 60 minute documentary and all (most?) Amorphis videos plus a photo gallery. Magic &amp; Mayhem - Tales From The Early Years was released in September 2010. It contains 12 tracks from the first three albums plus a bonus track Light My Fire. They have all been re-recorded with the current line up. Some arrangements have changed - essentially they are the songs as they have evolved through many concert tours, recorded in a studio environment. In May 2011, The Beginning Of Times was released and went straight to number 1 in the Finnish album charts and number 16 in the German charts.

They formed in London, UK in 1982. Pet Shop Boys are one of the most commercially and critically acclaimed British music artists ever. They have achieved eight platinum, two gold and four silver albums in the UK alone. Their career has spanned 25 years and is now in its fourth decade. They have sold 50 million records worldwide and are listed as the most successful duo in UK music history by The Guinness Book of Records. Three-time Brit Award winners and six-time Grammy nominees, since 1986 they have achieved 42 Top 30 singles and 22 Top 10 hits in the UK Singles Chart, including four number ones: &quot;West End Girls&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Sin&quot;, &quot;Always on My Mind&quot; and &quot;Heart&quot;. At the 2009 BRIT Awards, Pet Shop Boys received an award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. The band&#x27;s eleventh studio album, titled Elysium (continuing their tradition of single word titles), was released in September 2012. http://petshopboys. co. uk", "Iggy Pop": "Iggy Pop (born James Newell Osterberg, Jr. ; April 21, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and actor. Though widely known as an innovator and &quot;godfather&quot; of punk rock, Pop&#x27;s music has encompassed a number of styles over the years, including pop, hard rock, jazz and blues. Pop became known as &#x27;Iggy&#x27; in high school, during which time he served as drummer for local blues band The Iguanas. He is vocalist of influential proto-punk band The Stooges (Pop and the other surviving members of the group reunited in 2003), having become known, since the late 1960s, for his outrageous and unpredictable stage antics. Though his popularity has fluctuated through the years, many of Pop&#x27;s songs have become well-known, including &quot;Lust for Life&quot;, &quot;The Passenger&quot;, &quot;Real Wild Child&quot;, &quot;Candy&quot; (a duet with Kate Pierson of The B-52&#x27;s), &quot;China Girl&quot;, &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;, &quot;Search and Destroy&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot;. In 2010, The Stooges were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Pop was the lead singer of The Stooges, a late 1960s/early 1970s band that featured brothers Ron and Scott Asheton and Dave Alexander and was highly influential in the development of hard rock. The debut album was produced by the Velvet Underground&#x27;s John Cale. The band&#x27;s &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog&quot; is a garage punk standard. Raw Power was first released in1973, perhaps the first record that could truly be called punk. It was the confluence of The Stooges ages, hormones, creativity, ability, experience, tastes, lack of supervision, contempt for authority and ambition that has made Raw Power one of the most influential albums of all time. The Stooges were infamous for performances in which Pop leapt off the stage (hence, the &quot;stage dive&quot;), smeared raw meat or peanut butter over his chest and cut himself with broken bottles. A glimpse of the vibrating intensity of Iggy live can be seen in the Ramones movie &quot;End of the Century. &quot; Guitarist James Williamson became a key collaborator, a partnership documented on the 1978 album Kill City. In 25 years as a solo artist, Pop&#x27;s best-known songs have included the thumping Lust for Life, to be heard on the soundtrack of the find-a-vein, shoot-it-up movie Trainspotting, I&#x27;m Bored and The Passenger (the latter based on a poem written by Jim Morrison). David Bowie played a key role in reinvigorating Pop&#x27;s post-Stooges career and was a collaborator on the albums Lust for Life and The Idiot. Iggy may be under-rated as a songwriter. Bowie and Tina Turner covered his &quot;Tonight&quot;. Bowie also put out his own version of &quot;China Girl,&quot; while Grace Jones covered the icey &quot;Nightclubbing&quot;. ", "Jair Naves": "Solo career of Jair Naves, ex-Ludovic&#x27;s frontman. His first EP, &quot;Araguari&quot;, has been released in 2010. www. myspace. com/jairnaves", "Disturbed": "There are 2 acts by the name of Disturbed; 1) Well-known American hard rock band with lead singer David Michael Draiman, formed in 1996, with several albums including The Sickness (Giant/Reprise 2000), Believe (Giant/Reprise 2002), Ten Thousand Fists (Reprise, 2005), Indestructible (Reprise, 2008) and Asylum (Reprise, 2010). 2) Late 80&#x27;s American Thrash band who released the album Disturbing the Peace in 1988; formed by Earl Root in 86/87 and disbanded in 92/93 before his death in 2008. 1) Disturbed was formed in 1996 when musicians Dan Donegan, Steve Kmak, and Mike Wengren hired singer David Draiman in Chicago, Illinois. They have sold over 11 million albums worldwide, and released four consecutive #1 debuts a feat achieved by only two other rock bands in the history of the chart: Metallica and Dave Matthews Band. Originally classified as a nu metal band, Disturbed is now regarded by some music critics as hard rock or heavy metal, although others now regard them as nu metal. However, the band&#x27;s genre is still being debated. When asked about die-hard metal fans not finding Disturbed heavy enough, frontman David Draiman stated: &quot;We probably have too much melody going on or we&#x27;re not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it&#x27;s not what we try to do. If we have to place things in context, we&#x27;re more hard rock than heavy metal these days. &quot; Early Days, The Sickness In their early years, Disturbed started recording several demos and played live shows. Not long after, in 2000, the band released their debut album, titled The Sickness, which launched the band into stardom. The song Down With the Sickness became extremely popular and was later used in many film soundtracks. Soon after the release of &quot;The Sickness&quot;, Disturbed released a revamped cover version of &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin&#x27;s theme music for WWF called &quot;Glass Shatters&quot;. Disturbed headlined the Ozzfest tour in 2001 alongside Black Sabbath, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Papa Roach, Linkin Park, Black Label Society, and Crazy Town. Afterward, the band started their own tour, called Music as a Weapon. The bands Adema, Drowning Pool, Stereomud, and Systematic were featured on the tour alongside Disturbed. Before joining Marilyn Manson&#x27;s 2001 European tour, Disturbed&#x27;s bassist Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle. Fuzz injured his ankle by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed&#x27;s rehearsal hall in Chicago a few days before Christmas. He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. After a successful operation, doctors highly recommended that he skip the tour to avoid more severe damage to his foot. Kmak did perform with the band on January 11th and 12th of 2001 in Chicago however. A bass player named Marty O&#x27;Brian was recruited and filled Fuzz&#x27;s spot until Fuzz was able to play again. On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a &quot;documentary&quot; about the band titled M. O. L. , which showed some of the bands more personal moments in the studio and during tours. Believe In September 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album titled Believe, which debuted at #1. The songs Prayer, Liberate and Remember all became singles and many fans were impressed with the new album, despite it being less aggressive than their debut. The music video for &quot;Prayer&quot; was pulled from most TV stations due to the similarities it had with the September 11, 2001 attacks. Disturbed&#x27;s front man, David Draiman, recorded the vocals for Forsaken, a track written and produced by Jonathan Davis of the band Korn for the Queen of the Damned soundtrack. In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon II. The bands Chevelle, Taproot, and Unloco toured with them. In early 2003, after Disturbed had finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, the band experienced the departure of bassist Fuzz, who was excused from the group due to &quot;personal differences. &quot; He was replaced with Matt Konopinski very briefly, and then John Moyer, who is now the current bass player. Ten Thousand Fists Disturbed toured with 10 Years and Ill Nino in support of their third album Ten Thousand Fists, released worldwide on September 20, 2005, which also debuted at #1 in North America. Ten Thousand Fists had five B-side tracks that were not released on the album, but rather on various singles and other albums. Currently the track &quot;Hell&quot; can be found on the &quot;Stricken&quot; single (a second version of this single has the studio version of the track &quot;Dehumanized&quot;, which was originally featured as a live track on the Music as a Weapon II live album and DVD). The track can also be heard on the band&#x27;s MySpace page. The track &quot;Monster&quot; was originally released as part of an iTunes pre-order package for the first people who pre-ordered Ten Thousand Fists. Afterwards, the track was very hard to find. But, it can now be found on the &quot;Tour Edition&quot; of Ten Thousand Fists (along with the track &quot;Two Worlds&quot;). The track &quot;Sickened&quot; can be found on the &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; single. The fifth and final track &quot;Criminal&quot; has been released on the band&#x27;s newest album Indestructible. A month after the release of Ten Thousand Fists, Disturbed headlined the Jagermeister tour along with the band Corrosion of Conformity. Disturbed supplied the song &quot;Stricken&quot; for WWE&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Revolution 2006. In April 2006, the band completed an Australian tour supporting KoRn and sharing the tour with 10 Years and Hatebreed. In mid 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved twice due to David Draiman having troubles with his voice. In late 2006, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice. It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with Ozzy Osbourne, System of a Down, Dragon Force, Avenged Sevenfold, Lacuna Coil, and Hatebreed. The band also went on the European tour that had been previously moved twice earlier in 2006. Disturbed headlined another one of their own tours named Music as a Weapon III; the bands Flyleaf, Stone Sour, and Nonpoint toured with them. Dave Draiman and RIAA Draiman became involved in the music file sharing controversy by publicly speaking out against the RIAA&#x27;s lawsuits against filesharing individuals, despite the fact his record label is a member of the RIAA. &quot;This is not rocket science. Instead of spending all this money litigating against kids who are the people they&#x27;re trying to sell things to in the first place, they have to learn how to effectively use the Internet. For the artists, my ass&#8230;I didn&#x27;t ask them to protect me, and I don&#x27;t want their protection. &quot; - Draiman. Draiman told NYRock: &quot;I&#x27;m Very positive about the internet, Napster. I think it&#x27;s a tremendous tool for reaching many more people than we ever could without it. When you release music you want it to be heard by people. Artists really want to have their music heard. They want to have their creation heard by people. Nothing is going to do that better than Napster. I can&#x27;t tell you how many kids have come up to me and said, &#x27;I downloaded a couple of tunes off Napster and I went out and bought the album. &#x27; Or they say, &#x27;I want to come see you play. &#x27; I don&#x27;t really make money off of record sales anyway. &quot; Indestructible to Present (2007 - 2009) Indestructible was released in the United States on June 3, 2008 and in Australia on June 7, 2008 and became the band&#x27;s third consecutive number-one debut on the Billboard 200. A special &quot;Internet Only&quot; limited edition of the album that includes the B-side track &quot;Run&quot;, a making-of DVD with instructional videos, wrap-around poster, VIP laminate, access to special Disturbed events, and a special website with exclusive video, rare audio and more was also released. The band toured in support of the &quot;Mayhem Festival&quot; alongside Slipknot, DragonForce, and Mastodon during summer of 2008. Disturbed also completed a tour of Australia and New Zealand through August and September 2008. The band began their Music as a Weapon IV tour in March 2009 and it ended in late May. The tour, also dubbed a &quot;festival&quot;, featured the bands Killswitch Engage, Lacuna Coil, and Chimaira on the main stage. Asylum (2010-2011) In an earlier interview, David Draiman briefly talked about the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, stating that the album will be as dark as their previous album, Indestructible, if not darker. Song-writing for the fifth studio album began in late 2009. In an earlier interview with Mike Wengren and John Moyer, it was stated that, judging by Draiman&#x27;s feelings on the last few years of his life, that Disturbed&#x27;s new album will be aggressive, angry, and &quot;hard-hitting&quot;, but will be similar musically to their album Believe. Wengren also said that the new album may be released in the spring or summer of 2010. Additionally, Draiman has confirmed that a DVD is in the works. A countdown clock appeared on the band&#x27;s website, which ended on January 12, 2010 at 5:00 p. m. EST, and a trailer for the upcoming DVD, titled Decade of Disturbed, was revealed. In a July 2009 interview with FaceCulture, Draiman stated that the upcoming DVD will be &quot;chronicling the past decade of Disturbed&#x27;s existence. It&#x27;s meant to show our growth over the course of the decade. &quot; He also talked more about the upcoming fifth album: &quot;A couple of them that Danny has come up with are really amazing. But they&#x27;re just little pieces&#8230;it&#x27;s not even in two-three part progression . &quot; A few months later on March 23, 2010, the band released a reissue of their debut album, The Sickness, with the B-side tracks God of the Mind and A Welcome Burden, as well as updated artwork. It will also be available for the first time in vinyl format. On February 8, 2010, it was announced that the band had entered the studio in Chicago, Illinois to begin recording their fifth album, tentatively set for a summer 2010 release. Guitarist Dan Donegan stated that the band has around 15 to 18 songs for the new album. On April 20, 2010, roughly two months after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and were ready to begin mixing it in Los Angeles, California. As they did with their last album Indestructible, Disturbed stated that they self-produced Asylum. The band announced that Asylum would be released on August 31, 2010. On July 9, 2010, the track listing was revealed on the band&#x27;s official website. Asylum debuted at number-one on the Billboard 200. The Lost Children and hiatus (2011-present) In July 2011, the band confirmed it would go on hiatus after finishing their US tour that year, and in an interview that same month, Draiman dismissed concerns that the upcoming hiatus was a result of conflict between the band members, saying, &quot;This is really not due to any animosity. I want to make that very clear. In fact, we just had dinner together last night. Believe me, it&#x27;s not like we can&#x27;t work with each other any more or we don&#x27;t get along. This isn&#x27;t a bad blood thing, and I don&#x27;t ever want people to get that impression of it. &quot; Disturbed went into hiatus in October 2011. Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled The Lost Children, on November 8, 2011. On February 8, 2012, it was announced that John Moyer is Heavy Metal supergroup Adrenaline Mob&#x27;s new bass player. John made his onstage debut with the group on March 12, at New York City's Hiro Ballroom, a day before the release of the band&#x27;s debut full-length album, Omerta. On April 21, 2012, to commemorate Record Store Day, Disturbed released &quot;The Collection&quot;. It is a box set featuring the band&#x27;s five full length studio albums in 140 gram vinyl LPs. In May 2012 Draiman announced his new project, an industrial metal band called Device. Draiman has released information regarding the future of Disturbed and his new project Device. He has stated that Device will release their self-titled debut album on April 9, 2013. The album will feature many guest musicians from various metal bands. Donegan, guitarist for Disturbed, also stated to a journalist for MTV that the future for Disturbed was unclear. &quot;I don&#x27;t have a clear answer , because I&#x27;m not sure where everybody&#x27;s head&#x27;s at at the moment other than we&#x27;re having a great time out on tour, we&#x27;re going out big, we&#x27;re carrying big production, we wanna end this on a big note,&quot; he said. &quot;I think we&#x27;re not ready to sit down and have the discussions of when we wanna get back together or if we&#x27;re gonna. So we&#x27;re kind of winging it. &quot; On April 25, 2013, it was announced that guitarist Dan Donegan and drummer Mike Wengren had begun a new project with Evans Blue singer Dan Chandler, Fight or Flight. Their debut album, Life by Design? has been set for release on July 23. Official site: http://www. disturbed1. com 2) Late 80&#x27;s Thrash band who released the album Disturbing the Peace in 1988. &quot;Cool crossover/thrash metal. The music takes off quite a few times, especially when it comes up with contrasting mixtures, like &quot;Comatose&quot;, which blends heavy doomy riffage with brutal death-tinged outbursts; there are also some undeveloped, but intriguing attempts at more technical thrash (the instrumental &quot;Brain Deth&quot;, the sophisticated technical &quot;Productive Intercourse Serial Killer&quot;), spiced with some jolly, rock&#x27;n roll hooks. The shorter numbers are pure unbridled hardcore (&quot;Kill &#x27;Em&quot;), but here come the laid-back, soft moments (&quot;Bought &amp; Sold&quot;, &quot;Die Die Die&quot;), and things are well balanced. &quot;Evil Sensations&quot; is a pleasant surprise near the end, being energetic thrash/crossover, with a nice technical twist, followed by the melodic, but interesting instrumental &quot;Astronomically&quot;, leaving very good impression, partially ruined by the aggressive hardcore closer &quot;What The Fuck&quot;. The band disliked the popularity that a novelty song like WTF produced, and it WAS a fan favorite but largely dropped from their live set in the 1990s. Due in part to the lyrics and how the band felt about the song. The band was formed in Minneapolis, MN but toured extensively all over, including the stomping grounds of the later Disturbed; Chicago! They played Jack Koshick&#x27;s Milwaukee MetalFest in it&#x27;s earliest days and supported Sepultura and Pestilence on tour, as well as Death and Sadus, and local legends IMPALER. Earl passed away in 2008, he is missed by all who knew him, and his MySpace page remains testament. ", "The Slits": "The Slits were formed in 1976 in London, England. The original members, all female, were: Arianna Forster (aka Ari Up, Ari-Up &amp; Madusa, vocals), Paloma Romera (aka Palmolive, drums), Kate Korus (guitar) &amp; Suzi Gutsy (bass). Viv Albertine &amp; Tessa Politt would later replace Kate &amp; Suzi. Pete Clarke (aka Budgie, formerly of Spitfire Boys &amp; later to join Siouxsie and the Banshees), was the drummer when Palmolive left to join The Raincoats - then later Bruce Smith. They released their first album &#x27;Cut&#x27; on Island Records in 1979, a Bootleg Retrospective on Rough Trade Y in 1980, and The Return Of The Giant Slits in 1981. Further releases since their initial split in 1981 are two sessions for the John Peel show released on Strange Fruit, In The Beginning: A Live Anthology 1977-1981, and Live At The Cibus Club. Ari Up, went on to help form, The New Age Steppers. The Slits have since reformed with original members Ari Up and Tessa Politt plus new members Hollie Cook on keybooards, and Anna Schulte on drums, and guitarist No. The band toured widely and released another album, Return of the Giant Slits before breaking up in early 1982. Ari Up and Tessa Pollitt reformed the band with new members in 2005. In October 2006 the EP Revenge Of The Killer Slits was issued and in October 2009 the well-received album Trapped Animal was released. On Wednesday October 20th 2010 John Lydon&#x27;s web site announced that, after a serious illness, Ari Up had died. Sites: Wikipedia , Discogs and MusicBrainz", "Fifth Harmony": "Fifth Harmony (commonly initialized as 5H ) is five-member American girl group formed on the second season of The X Factor in 2012. The group are from Miami, Florida, United States, the members consists of Ally Brooke, Normani Hamilton, Dinah Jane Hansen, Camila Cabello, and Lauren Jauregui. They signed a joint deal with Syco Music, owned by Simon Cowell, and Epic Records, L. A. Reid&#x27;s record label, after finishing in third place behind Tate Stevens and Carly Rose Sonenclar on the show. Fifth Harmony won MTV&#x27;s Artist To Watch award at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. In 2014, Fifth Harmony was labeled as the #1 most &#x27;Influential&#x27; X Factor USA contestant of all-time by FoxWeekly. Their debut EP, &quot;Better Together&quot; was released in 2013 with a first week position of No. 6 on the Billboard 200. Their debut studio album, &quot;Reflection&quot; will be released in January 2015. Fifth Harmony is composed of five singers who all successfully auditioned as soloists on The X Factor, but failed to progress individually to the Judges&#x27; Houses stage of the competition. They were later formed as a group at the end of bootcamp by Simon Cowell, thus qualifying for the &quot;Groups&quot; category. Originally, the group&#x27;s name was &quot;LYLAS&quot; (acronym for Love You Like a Sister), but another group called &quot;The Lylas&quot; (which consists of four of Bruno Mars&#x27; sisters) claimed that the show stole their name. Thereafter, LYLAS changed their name to &quot;1432&quot; (which stands for I Love You Too), which was announced on the first live show on October 31, 2012, during which 1432 performed &quot;We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together&quot; by Taylor Swift. Simon Cowell and L. A. Reid were critical of the new name, and Cowell suggested that the group be renamed again. During the first live results show on November 1, 2012, 1432 performed &quot;Skyscraper&quot; by Demi Lovato in a sing-off with Sister C. Cowell decided to send 1432 through to the Top 12 and he announced that they would be renamed by the viewers online. The name chosen by the public was announced: &quot;Fifth Harmony&quot;. ", "Kings of Leon": "Kings of Leon is an American rock band that formed in Nashville, Tennessee, United States in 1999, consisting of brothers Anthony &quot;Caleb&quot; Followill (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Ivan &quot;Nathan&quot; Followill (drums, percussion, backing vocals) and Michael &quot;Jared&quot; Followill (bass guitar, backing vocals), with their cousin Cameron &quot;Matthew&quot; Followill (lead guitar, backing vocals). Each member of the family group is known by their middle name (second given name) as opposed to their first given name. The band&#x27;s early music was an upbeat blend of southern rock and blues influences but the band has gradually expanded their sound to include a variety of genres, including alternative rock. Kings of Leon achieved initial success in the United Kingdom with nine Top 40 singles, two BRIT Awards in 2008, and all three of the band&#x27;s albums at the time peaking in the top five of the UK Albums Chart. Their third album Because of the Times also reached the number one spot. After the release of Only by the Night in 2008 they finally achieved chart success in their native United States. The singles Sex on Fire, Use Somebody and Notion peaked at number one on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, while the album itself was their first ever platinum-selling album in the US. Early years (1999-2002) The three Followill brothers spent much of their youth traveling around the Southern United States with their father, Ivan &quot;Leon&quot; Followill, a traveling Pentecostal Church preacher and their mother, Betty-Ann, who taught them when they were not in school. Caleb and Jared were both born in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, while Nathan and Matthew were born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. According to Rolling Stone magazine, &quot;While Leon preached at churches and tent revivals throughout the Deep South, the boys attended services and were occasionally enlisted to bang on some drums. They were either home-schooled or enrolled in small parochial schools at this time. Except for a five-year period when they settled in Jackson, Tennessee, the Followill&#x27;s childhoods were spent driving through the south in a purple 1988 Oldsmobile, decamping for a week or two wherever Leon was scheduled to preach. &quot; When the boys&#x27; father resigned from the church and divorced his wife in 1997, the boys relocated to Nashville and embraced the rock music and lifestyle they had previously been denied. While there, they met songwriter Angelo Petraglia, who helped the siblings hone their songwriting skills and introduced them to the musical influences of the Rolling Stones, The Clash, and Thin Lizzy in particular. Six months later, Nathan and Caleb signed with RCA Records, who insisted that the duo recruit more members for the band before launching their career. The band was formed when cousin Matthew and younger brother Jared were asked to join. They named themselves Kings of Leon in honor of Nathan, Caleb, and Jared&#x27;s father and grandfather, who were both named Leon. In an interview, Caleb admitted to &quot;kidnapping&quot; their cousin Matthew from his hometown in Mississippi in order for him to join the band. They told his mother that he was just staying for a week, but they consequently never allowed him to return home. Drummer Nathan added, &quot;When we signed the deal with RCA, it was just me and Caleb. The label told us they were going to put a band together, but we said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to buy our little brother a bass, he&#x27;s a freshman in high school. Caleb will teach himself the guitar. Our cousin Matthew played guitar when he was 10 and I&#x27;ll play drums. &#x27; The record label agreed,&quot;. Youth and Young Manhood and Aha Shake Heartbreak (2003 - 2005) Their first record, the Holy Roller Novocaine EP was released on February 18, 2003. At this stage, Jared was only 16 years old and had not yet learned to play the bass guitar. The release of Holy Roller Novocaine gave the Kings of Leon a significant amount of exposure prior to the release of their debut album, Youth and Young Manhood, receiving a 4/5 star rating from Rolling Stone magazine. Four of the five songs would later be released on Youth and Young Manhood, however the versions of Wasted Time and California Waiting on the EP differ, with the first having a more tense riff and different vocal style than the same track off Youth and Young Manhood, and the latter being recorded in a rush to finish the record. The EP contains the B-side Wicker Chair while another track titled Andrea, was discarded prior to its release. All the songs released on the EP were co-written by Angelo Petraglia who also produced the record. The band&#x27;s debut studio album, Youth and Young Manhood was released in the UK in July 2003, and in the United States in August of the same year. The album was recorded between Sound City Studios in Los Angeles and Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California, with producer Ethan Johns (son of producer Glyn Johns who most notably worked with the Rolling Stones and the Eagles). The album received some critical notice domestically, but became a sensation in the UK and Ireland, where NME declared it &quot;one of the best debut album of the last 10 years&quot;. Following the release of the album, Kings of Leon was chosen to tour with fellow American rock band The Strokes and U2. The band&#x27;s second album Aha Shake Heartbreak was released in the UK in October 2004 and in the United States in February 2005. Building on the southern-infused garage rock of their first album, the album broadened the band&#x27;s domestic and international audience. The album was again produced by Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns. The Bucket, Four Kicks, and King of the Rodeo were all released as singles, with the &quot;The Bucket&quot; rising into the Top 20 in Britain. Taper Jean Girl was also used in the 2007 movie Disturbia and the movie Cloverfield in 2008. The band garnered accolades from several of their rock peers, including Elvis Costello, and also toured with Bob Dylan and Pearl Jam during 2005 and 2006. Because of the Times (2006-07) In March 2006, Kings of Leon were back in the studio with their producers Angelo Petraglia and Ethan Johns, working on their third album. Guitarist Matthew told NME: &quot;Man, we&#x27;re sitting on a bunch of songs right now that we wish we could let the world hear&quot;. The band&#x27;s third album was titled Because of the Times, which may be a reference to a church ministers conference of the same name held at The Pentecostals of Alexandria church in Alexandria, Louisiana that the brothers often attended. The album showed a clear evolution from Kings of Leon&#x27;s previous work, as the band&#x27;s trademark dirty, southern-fried swagger was replaced with a more polished, clean-cut sound. The album was released on April 2, 2007 in the UK, and a day later in the United States, preceded by the single On Call, which became a hit in Britain and Ireland. It debuted at number one in Britain and Ireland and entered the European charts at number twenty-five, selling approximately 70,000 copies in its first week of release. NME said that the album &quot;cements Kings of Leon as one of the great American bands of our times. &quot; and Entertainment Weekly called Because of the Times &quot;an epic wide-screen movie of a CD and the band&#x27;s best to date. &quot; However, some critics found the album inferior to their previous efforts. Stylus Magazine rated it a C- and noted &quot;If they wanted us to take them serious this time around, they&#x27;d at least try to be right honest about their ascent into minor celebrity and not keep on with the yokel facade. Without cautionary yarns regarding life on the tour bus or banging supermodels, the bright-eyed, legs-stretched mood of the music rings just as hollow. &quot; Dave Hood of Artrocker gave the album one star out of five, finding that &quot;Kings of Leon are experimenting, learning, and getting a bit lost. &quot; Pitchfork Media contended that &quot;Because of the Times sounds suspiciously like a counterattack on womankind, launched from somewhere in the mid-1990s, deep inside a bruised, stadium-sized ego. &quot; In spite of the mixed recognition, the album spawned a number of hit singles in Europe, including Charmer and Fans, along with a number of crowd favorites such as Knocked Up and My Party. Only by the Night (2008-09) After recording throughout most of 2008, &quot;the all American long haired rockers&quot; (The Times), released their fourth studio album Only by the Night on September 19, which subsequently entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and remained there for one more week. Only By The Night also had two single week stints as the UK #1 album in 2009, one directly after the BRIT Awards. In the United States, the album reached number 5 on the Billboard Charts. Reception to the album was the most polarized yet, with the British press granting the album glowing reviews. Q Magazine named Only by the Night &quot;Album of the Year&quot; for 2008. In the United States, reactions to the album were more mixed. Spin, Rolling Stone, and All Music Guide gave the album positive reviews, while Pitchfork Media gave the album a virtual equivalent of 2 stars. The album was officially named as the UK&#x27;s third biggest selling album of 2008 and the biggest selling album of 2008 in Australia. Sex on Fire was the first single released for download in the UK on 8 September. The song became their most successful ever as it peaked at number one in the UK and in Ireland. It was also their first song to chart number one on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock chart. The second single to be released from the album on December 8, 2008 was Use Somebody which achieved worldwide chart success and consistency, such as peaking at number two in the UK Singles Chart, and also reaching top ten chart positions in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and the United States. The album&#x27;s popularity in Australia was confirmed with a total of four singles being voted into the world&#x27;s largest online music poll, the &quot;Triple J Hottest 100&quot;. The song Crawl came in at number 70, Closer was voted number 24 and &quot;Use Somebody&quot; finished number 3 in the poll. However, their biggest success from Only By The Night was &quot;Sex on Fire&quot; which was voted number 1 in the Hottest 100 poll for 2008 and number 90 in the Triple J Hottest 100 of All Time, 2009 poll. &quot;Sex on Fire&quot; also won the band a Grammy Award at the 51st Grammy Awards held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on February 8, 2009. They won Best International Band and Best International Album at the Brit Awards in 2009, where they also performed &quot;Use Somebody&quot; live. Kings of Leon also performed on 14 March 2009 at Sound Relief, a benefit concert, for the Victorian Bushfire Crisis. The song &quot;Crawl&quot; from this album was released as a free download on the band&#x27;s website on July 28. The third and fourth singles were Revelry, which peaked at number 19 in New Zealand and Notion, which peaked at number 24 in Belgian charts. Only By The Night was certified platinum in the United States by the RIAA for selling one million copies in less than a year after its release. In 2009, the band headlined a number of music festivals, including Reading &amp; Leeds, Rock Werchter, Oxegen, T In The Park, Gurtenfestival and Open&#x27;er Festival in Europe, along with Sasquatch, Lollapalooza, and Austin City Limits in the United States. That same year, the band won their first Grammy Award for the single &quot;Sex on Fire&quot;, as well as two BRIT Awards for &quot;Best International Group&quot; and &quot;Best International Album. &quot; The album Only by the Night also won an NME Award for &quot;Album of the Year. &quot; Future projects (2009-2011) The band has announced the release of a live DVD on November 10, 2009 and a remix album due for release in the coming months, though the latter is untitled and unscheduled at the moment. The DVD was filmed at London&#x27;s O2 Arena in July 2009. In an interview with Billboard. com drummer Nathan stated, &quot;England is really the first place we broke &#8230; We figured what better place to make a live DVD than where the fans have been the craziest for the longest?&quot; The show featured some choice rarities, and Nathan continued by saying &quot;we just put the cameras in the back of our minds and acted like they weren&#x27;t even there. &quot; The remix album came to life after Kings of Leon learned that other artists had started working on revisions of the band&#x27;s songs. Mark Ronson, Kenna, Lykke Li with her cover of &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, and Linkin Park are also contributing a remix to the album. On October 17, 2009, the night of the final show of the US tour in Nashville, Tennessee, Nathan Followill posted &quot;Now it&#x27;s time to start creating the next musical chapter in the novel that is Kings of Leon. Thanks again to all. Boomer fucking Sooner. &quot; on his personal Twitter page. Mechanical Bull (2012-present): Kings of Leon bassist Jared Followill confirmed that the band had finished recording their sixth LP, which should see release September 2013. The album title Mechanical Bull was revealed on June 7, and the album released on September 24. The album&#x27;s first single, entitled &quot;Supersoaker&quot;, was released on July 17, 2013. Controversy Kings of Leon caused controversy at the 2009 Reading Festival when Caleb Followill tried to get the crowd going by asking &quot;I thought this was supposed to be the loudest crowd in the world?&quot; Picking up on a perceived hostility towards the band, he announced &quot;we know you&#x27;re sick of Kings of Leon, so for all those who don&#x27;t give a fuck about us, I understand. But we&#x27;ve worked fucking hard to get here. So anyone that has anything to say to us, fuck you. We&#x27;re the goddamn Kings of Leon. &quot; The band later smashed their guitars in anger and made rude gestures before leaving the stage. Nathan Followill further criticized the Reading crowd on his twitter page, declaring &quot;Zero love for the kings. I know it was cold but holy shit, y&#x27;all were frozen. I can only hope Leeds is in better form. &quot;. At the Leeds Festival Caleb again bad-mouthed Reading while complimenting the Leeds crowd declaring &quot;We&#x27;re only five songs in and you&#x27;ve blown Reading to hell&quot;, while complimenting UK crowds in general stating &quot;It was the UK that made us feel like we could take on the world. &quot; Discography  * Youth and Young Manhood (2003)  * Aha Shake Heartbreak (2004)  * Because of the Times (2007)  * Only by the Night (2008)  * Come Around Sundown (2010)  * Mechanical Bull (2013)", "Marina   the Diamonds": "", "Black Mountain": "Black Mountain is a rock band from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The band is composed of Stephen McBean, Amber Webber, Matt Camirand, Jeremy Schmidt and Joshua Wells. Since forming in 2004, Black Mountain has released three LPs, Black Mountain (2005), In the Future (2008), and Wilderness Heart (2010), and two EPs, Druganaut (2004) and Bastards of Light (2008) on the Jagjaguwar label. A split single with Destroyer was released in Fall 2004 on Spirit of Orr Records. The &quot;Stormy High&quot; single was released in 2006 on Suicide Squeeze Records. A vinyl single was released in April 2007 named &quot;Surrender Sound Session: Unkle vs. Autolux/Black Mountain&quot; with a remix of &quot;No Hits&quot; on the B side. Their self-titled album was chosen as one of Amazon. com&#x27;s Top 100 Editor&#x27;s Picks of 2005. In the Future was a finalist for the 2008 Polaris Music Prize and was also nominated for &quot;Best Alternative Album&quot; in the 2009 Juno Awards. The song &quot;Stay Free&quot; from In the Future was featured on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack. In 2005 the band opened for Coldplay on their Twisted Logic Tour for three weeks, with their final opening in San Diego. In September 2010 Black Mountain performed in an amphitheater located in the woods of Oisterwijk at the Incubate (festival) in Tilburg, Netherlands. Leader Stephen McBean also heads another similarly named band, Pink Mountaintops, who are the more experimental side of McBean&#x27;s musical abilities. Black Mountain is the front line band for Black Mountain Army, a collective of musicians, artists and friends in Vancouver. In an interview the band said &quot;Black Mountain is just the five of us. The Black Mountain Army. . . which has kind of gotten blown out of proportion, it was kind of just a joke, because everybody thought we were this hippie collective, like we all lived in one house. But it's basically just our friends at home in Vancouver, just our extended family of creative people that we know. &quot; Several members of the band have, for as long as a decade, worked for organizations that meet the basic living requirements of the chronically poor, drug addicted and mentally ill in Vancouver&#x27;s Downtown Eastside neighborhood, such as Insite. In an interview, the band said: &quot;After work we all try not to think too hard about the effect it has on our lives. It keeps us grounded. &quot; Wilderness Heart was named as a longlisted nominee for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize. March 11, 2014 The Black Mountain song &quot;Wucan&quot; was featured on season 2 of the FOX drama &quot;The Following&quot; during the eighth episode entitled &quot;Messenger&quot;. The Black Mountain song &quot;Druganaut&quot; is featured in a June, 2014 Father&#x27;s Day commercial for J. C. Penney. ", "Michael Jackson": "Michael Joseph Jackson (born August 29, 1958 in Gary, Indiana, died June 25, 2009 in Los Angeles, California), often referred to as The King of Pop, is the biggest-selling solo artist of all time, with over 750,000,000 sales. Jackson is an inductee of the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and double inductee to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. His awards include 8 Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, and 26 Billboard Awards. He is also credited for popularizing many physically complicated dance moves, such as the robot and the moonwalk, and has influenced and spawned a whole generation of a wide variety of artists including Justin Timberlake, Mariah Carey and Usher, among others. Jackson&#x27;s musical career began in 1967 as lead singer of The Jackson 5, when the group made their first recording with a local label before signing up with Motown Records in 1968. He made his first solo recordings in 1971 while still a member of the group. But it was Off the Wall (1979) which marked the start of his full-fledged solo career, and he formally parted with his siblings in 1984. In his solo career, Jackson recorded and co-produced the best-selling album of all time, Thriller (with worldwide sales over 100 million), received thirteen Grammy awards and charted thirteen #1 singles in the U. S. Throughout his four-decade career, Michael Jackson has been awarded numerous honors, including the World Music Awards Best-selling Pop Male Artist of the Millennium. He is also a double-inductee into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1997, and in 2001 as a solo artist. He is also a member of the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In the mid-1980s, TIME magazine described Jackson as &quot;the hottest single phenomenon since Elvis Presley&quot;. He has had a notable impact on music and culture throughout the world while also tearing down racial barriers and paving the way for modern pop music. From 1988 to 2005, Jackson lived on his Neverland Ranch property, on which he built an amusement park and private zoo for the enjoyment of economically disadvantaged and terminally ill children. In 1993 and 2003, separate accusations of child molestation that allegedly occurred in Neverland were made against Jackson, which drew intense negative media coverage. While he was never charged for the first case, Jackson was tried and vindicated in 2005 of the latter allegation, but moved out of the US shortly thereafter. He later returned to Las Vegas in early 2007. Over the past few years Jackson has made numerous public appearances including MTV Japan&#x27;s VMA awards where he accepted the legends award; the World Music Awards where he accepted the Diamond Award for selling over 100 million records; James Brown&#x27;s funeral where he paid tribute and delivered his sermon; and a fan appreciation event in Tokyo, Japan, where he also greeted troops at US Army base Camp Zama. In early 2008, Jackson issued Thriller 25th Anniversary , a critical, and commercial success that is currently the second-biggest selling album of 2008 with over 2. 1 million copies sold worldwide. On June 25, 2009, Jackson collapsed at a rented home in Holmby Hills in Los Angeles, California. The cause of death is currently believed to be cardiac arrest. At the time of his death, Jackson was scheduled to perform 50 sold-out concerts to over one million people, at London&#x27;s O2 arena, from July 13, 2009, to March 6, 2010. During a publicity press conference, Jackson made suggestions of possible retirement. In the hours following Jackson&#x27;s death, his record sales increased dramatically. His seminal album Thriller climbed to number one on the American iTunes music chart, while another eight have made it into the top 40. In the UK, where Jackson would have performed less than three weeks after his death, fifteen of his albums occupied the top 15 spots on the Amazon music chart. Social music network website Last. fm also saw a dramatic increase in Michael Jackson plays per hour after the announcement of his death. On December 10, 2010, a compilation album of previously unreleased material, simply entitled Michael , was released posthumously. Featuring guest performances by Akon, 50 Cent and Lenny Kravitz, the album was certified Platinum in 18 countries but received mixed reviews from most critics. This was followed in November 2011 by Immortal , a remix album; in September 2012 by Bad 25 , a 25th anniversary reissue of Jackson&#x27;s 1987 hit album Bad ; and by Xscape , a second compilation album released in May 2014.

", "Foals": "Foals are an Indie Rock/British Rock band which formed in Oxford, England in 2005. They released their debut album Antidotes on 24 March 2008 in the UK (Transgressive), and 8 April 2008 in the US (sub pOp). The band&#x27;s second album, Total Life Forever, was released on 10 May 2010. Foals also released a mixtape named Tapes in July 2012 for !K7 Records. In November 2012, as an advance off their third album Holy Fire (February 2013), the band released Inhaler. Foals returned in June 2015 with What went down, also giving name to the August released fourth album &quot;What went down&quot;. In early 2007, the band released the limited edition 7&quot; singles Hummer and Mathletics, both produced by Gareth Parton. In the summer of 2007 Foals began working on their debut album in New York. It was produced by Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio, however, the band decided to mix the album themselves, stating that Sitek made the first master copy of the album sound like &quot;it was recorded in the Grand Canyon&quot;. Yannis has stated multiple times during various interviews that Foals and Dave Sitek are on good terms, even though the copy by Sitek was rejected by the band. Foals released their debut album, entitled Antidotes, on 24 March 2008 in the UK and 8 April 2008 in the US. The album was a commercial success in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 3 in the UK Albums Charts. The album was a minor success in other countries, charting in Japan, France and the Netherlands. Non-UK versions of the album include the early Parton produced singles. In August 2009, Foals started recording their second album at Svenska Grammofon Studion in Gothenburg, Sweden. The album, Total Life Forever, has been described by the band members as sounding like &quot;tropical prog&quot; and &quot;like the dream of an eagle dying&quot;. The band have described the album as being &quot;a lot less funk&quot; than they had originally planned. The album was produced by Luke Smith, formerly of Clor, and its title is named after an element of Ray Kurzweil&#x27;s theory of singularity. The band&#x27;s frontman Yannis Philippakis has professed a long time interest in futurology, with it informing numerous songs on Total Life Forever. On 1 March 2010, the promotional single &quot;Spanish Sahara&quot; was first played on Zane Lowe&#x27;s show Radio 1. Foals&#x27; new website was updated that night with the release of a video for the track directed by longtime collaborator Dave Ma. On 6 March, the Total Life Forever site was officially launched. Puzzles revealed images, lyrics and sound clips of songs from the album. The last clip appeared on 12 March, and resulted with a password entry for the Foals&#x27; new website. The site was opened on 13 March and presented the whole new art concept and media including samples of songs, photos and videos. Lead single &quot;This Orient&quot; was released on 3 May 2010. The album was finally released on 10 May 2010. &quot;Spanish Sahara&quot; was later released as a full physical single in September 2010, featuring an edited remix starring the strings of London Contemporary Orchestra. The album was nominated for the 2010 Mercury Prize. The lead singer of Youthmovies, Andrew Mears, originally formed the band Foals, playing as guitarist and lead vocalist. He was present on the band&#x27;s debut 7&quot; single &quot;Try This on Your Piano/Look at My Furrows of Worry&quot;, but left shortly afterwards to concentrate on Youthmovies&#x27; debut album Good Nature. Jack Bevan, Lina Simon and Yannis Philippakis were originally in cult math rock band The Edmund Fitzgerald, which did not gain much media interest. The group disbanded, claiming that things had become &quot;too serious&quot; and that they wanted to have more &quot;fun making their music&quot;. Walter Gervers and Jimmy Smith were part of a small Oxford band called Face Meets Grill. They met at and formed the band from members of Abingdon Boys School. They played gigs in and around Oxford, and recorded an EP in Hull. After playing Truck Festival in 2004 they separated to follow different paths and careers. Guitarist Jimmy Smith is the only one of the band members to have completed his degree, at Hull University: each of the band members quit their respective universities when the band signed to Transgressive Records by Ben Mackereth. The band likes to be self-sufficient, so the music videos &amp; the photography is done by their friend Dave Ma and all of the artwork (excluding cover art of Total Life Forever) is also done by their friend Tinhead. http://foals. co. uk", "Queen": "Queen were an English rock band originally consisting of four members: vocalist Freddie Mercury, guitarist Brian May, bass guitarist John Deacon, and drummer Roger Taylor. The band formed in London in 1970 after May and Taylor&#x27;s former band Smile split after having released an album and single. Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter&#x27;s departure from the original trio. There was much deliberation as to what the band&#x27;s name would be. May and Taylor had settled upon the Grand Dance, derived from a C. S. Lewis Trilogy of books Out Of The Silent Planet. Ultimately, the band went with Queen, a name that was entirely Freddie&#x27;s. Originally Roger and, especially, Brian did not like the name, though Mercury would eventually persuade them both that it was &quot;right&quot; for the band. &quot;Years ago I thought up the name Queen&#8230; It&#x27;s just a name, but it&#x27;s very regal, and it sounds splendid. It&#x27;s a strong name, very universal and immediate. It had a lot of visual potential and was open to all sorts of interpretations. I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it. &quot; - Freddie Mercury. Queen went through several bass players before a young electronics major by the name of John Deacon arrived on the scene in January of 1971. &quot;Until John, it had been exploding bass player syndrome. If they musically worked they&#x27;d look all wrong, and if they felt all right they couldn&#x27;t play. - Brian May. This quite shy guy turned up with his immaculate Rickenbacker bass and immaculate amplifier, plugged in, and as soon as he started playing we realized it was right. &quot; - Brian May. Later that year, the band was secured recording time at the newly built De Lane Lea studio, and used the opportunity to record several songs that would later appear on their debut album - Liar, Keep Yourself Alive, Jesus, and The Night Comes Down. The demo reel was passed around from producer to producer with little success, until a staff member of Trident records by the name of Roy Thomas Baker was introduced to the band by fellow Trident producer John Anthony. Baker dropped in to watch the band at work and, clearly liking what he heard, recommended Queen to his superiors. It was eventually agreed upon that the fledgling band could record at Trident studios, though after already-established artists had finished their work, such as the likes of Elton John and David Bowie. Relegated to the wee hours of the morning to record the remaining tracks of their first album, the band nonetheless stuck it out until they reached their ultimate goal of &quot;perfection&quot;. Queen&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in 1973 and received little attention from the general public. They quickly followed it a year later with a second album, &quot;Queen II&quot; which also failed to generate much interest from music fans in Britain, despite the success of the album&#x27;s single, Seven Seas of Rhye, which would reach #10 on the charts after the band&#x27;s mimed appearance on Top of the Pops . The band&#x27;s second album was recorded with a higher budget than the first, and the band threw everything they had into recording it. Queen II was somewhat of a &quot;concept album&quot;, split into &quot;White Side&quot; vs. &quot;Black Side&quot;. As was in their nature, the band pressed onward after the mediocre success of their first two albums, immersing themselves in a world-wide tour to promote Queen II. Queen played in America for the first time, as a support act for Mott the Hoople. Sheer Heart Attack would be released later that year, focusing more on being accessible to listeners, than the grand and complex ideas of the previous two albums. The recording of their third album was met with some hardships, as May fell victim to a series of illnesses brought on by an infected inoculation, required for the band&#x27;s rigorous touring schedule. Sheer Heart Attack brought even more success for the band, with May&#x27;s Now I&#x27;m Here and the song that would be the band&#x27;s &quot;turning point&quot;, the Mercury-penned Killer Queen, the latter of which would reach #2 on the UK charts. During this time, the band began developing a huge following in Japan and witnessed their popularity for themselves when they visited the country, mainly in 1975, to promote their fourth and most famous album &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot;, featuring the epic &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. Queen&#x27;s popularity grew steadily through the latter half of the 70s as they released hit album after hit album, reaching its peak in the mid-80s after their &quot;Live Aid&quot; appearance, and continuing into the early 90s before Mercury&#x27;s untimely death on 24th November 1991. The official cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. Over the course of their 30 year career, the band did sound tracks for two films ( &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Highlander&quot; ), released a string of live and studio albums, and had many many fans across the world. In 1995, 4 years after Mercury&#x27;s death, the band released the album &quot;Made In Heaven&quot;. This album saw the surviving band members in the studio completing or reworking unused vocals, unreleased variations of Freddie solo material ( a Queen version of &quot;I Was Born To Love You&quot; for example ), and tracks where Brian and Roger added lyrics to flesh out a song ( &quot;Mother Love&quot; ). Queen have been on indefinite hiatus since 1997, when John Deacon decided to retire. Several &quot;Queen + &#8230;&quot; projects have been developed in the following years, a few of them mere remixes with no artistic involvement from the band. In 1999, a &quot;Greatest Hits III&quot; album was released. This featured, among others, &quot;Queen + Wyclef Jean&quot; on a rap version of &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;, a live version of &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; performed by George Michael, and a live version of &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot; performed live in 1997 with Elton John. Brian May and Roger Taylor have performed together as Queen on several occasions ( award ceremonies, charity concerts, and the like ), sharing vocals with various guest singers. They have also recorded several covers of Queen&#x27;s hits with guest vocalists, including &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; ( first with Five and later Britney Spears, Beyonce, John Farnham and P!nk ) and &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; ( with Robbie Williams ). On the 14th of May 2002 the Queen musical &#x27;We Will Rock You&#x27; opened in the Dominion theatre in London&#x27;s &#x27;West End&#x27;. A Musical about young people in the distant future who aren&#x27;t allowed to listen to music not generated by computers. Various Queen songs are used in the story, played by a live band. This live band was supported by Brian May and Roger Taylor on the premiere evening. At the end of 2004, May and Taylor announced that they would reunite and return to touring in 2005, with Paul Rodgers (founder and former lead singer of Free and Bad Company). Brian May&#x27;s website also stated that Rodgers would be &#x27;featured with&#x27; Queen as &#x27;Queen + Paul Rodgers&#x27;, not replacing Mercury. The retired John Deacon would not be participating. Between 2005 and 2006 Queen + Paul Rodgers embarked on a world tour, the first leg in Europe and the second, Japan and then the US in 2006. On 15 August 2006, Brian May confirmed through his website and fan club that Queen + Paul Rodgers would begin producing their first studio album beginning in October, to be recorded at a &quot;secret location&quot;. The album, titled The Cosmos Rocks, was released in Europe on 12 September 2008 and in the United States on 28 October 2008. Following the album the band again embarked on a tour through Europe, opening on Kharkiv&#x27;s Freedom Square in front of 350,000 Ukrainian fans. The show in Ukraine was later released on DVD. Queen and Paul Rodgers officially split up without animosity on 12 May 2009. Rodgers did not rule out the possibility of working together again.

No strangers to the road, Twenty One Pilots has built a fervent national following via their electrifying live performances at innumerable headline shows and tours. The band made its Fueled By Ramen debut with a new EP titled Three Songs released Summer 2012 and was followed by a full-length album titled Vessel available now. The band is set to release their second signed album, Blurryface, on May 19, 2015 through Fueled By Ramen. The band was formed in 2009 in Columbus, Ohio by college friends, Tyler Joseph, Nick Thomas, and Chris Salih. Tyler came up with the band&#x27;s name while studying All My Sons by Arthur Miller, a play about a man who must decide what is best for his family after causing the death of &#x27;twenty one pilots&#x27; during World War II because he knowingly sent them faulty parts for the good of his business. Tyler explains that this story of moral dilemma was the inspiration for the name of the band. On December 29, 2009, they released their debut, self-titled album and began touring Ohio. In mid 2011, Thomas and Salih sequentially left due to busy schedules. Both posted farewell notes on the band&#x27;s official Facebook page. Joseph was then joined by Josh Dun, former live drummer of House of Heroes. Twenty One Pilots bring a mix of piano (sometimes an electronic keyboard or a keytar), synthesizer, drums (also mixed with electronic drums some parts), vocals, and occasionally ukulele. Their songs are poetry-based (written by Tyler and Josh), and when his poetry is too long he stated that he needs to start rapping to fit the lyrics in.

The band&#x27;s style is a blend of alternative, alt country, folk rock and psychedelic rock.

And it just felt a lot like it did when we were first starting out. \" James co-produced the record with Tucker Martine. The pair first worked together when James appeared on Laura Veirs &#x27; album &quot;July Flame&quot; in 2010, which Martine, Veirs' husband, also produced.

", "30 Seconds to Mars": "Founded in 1998 in Los Angeles, California, United States by Jared Leto and his brother, Shannon, 30 Seconds to Mars initially began as a small family project. Matt Wachter later joined the band as bassist and keyboard player. After working with a number of guitarists (including Kevin Drake and Solon Bixler), the band auditioned Tomo Milicevic to complete the band&#x27;s official roster. After Wachter&#x27;s departure from the band in 2006, the Leto brothers and Milicevic continue on as a trio with additional touring members, including Tim Kelleher on bass. Band&#x27;s Logo The band&#x27;s phoenix logo. The band&#x27;s phoenix logo (which the band named &quot;Mithra&quot;) bears the phrase &quot;Provehito in Altum&quot;, the band&#x27;s motto, roughly translated from Latin as &quot;Launch forth into the deep&quot;, but a more stylized version would be &quot;Rocket in(to) High(ness)&quot; or &quot;March The Skies&quot;. The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band&#x27;s debut, whereas for A Beautiful Lie, the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls, along with the band&#x27;s name and motto. For This Is War, the band has adopted the alchemical symbol for air, continuing on the sky/air theme. The Echelon The Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars, which helps in bringing friends to the shows, phoning local radio stations to request the band&#x27;s songs, putting up posters, posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online, voting for the band in official award nominations and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band. It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars. Studio albums: 30 Seconds to Mars - 2002 Their debut self-titled album, 30 Seconds to Mars, released on August 27, 2002 in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. Jared Leto described the record as a concept album that focuses on human struggle and self-determination, in which otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas are used to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album reached #107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers, selling 121,000 copies in the United States alone. It was preceded by the single &quot;Capricorn (A Brand New Name)&quot;, which peaked at number 31 on the US Mainstream Rock chart and entered the top ten of the UK Rock Chart. Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; a critic felt that the band has &quot;managed to carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm. &quot; Although the album was a slow-burning success, it eventually sold two million copies worldwide as of March 2011. A Beautiful Lie - 2005 A Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005 in the United States. Because the album was leaked five months before its release, the band decided to include two bonus tracks: &quot;Battle of One&quot; (an original song that was also set to be the album&#x27;s title track when it was first announced) and &quot;Hunter&quot; (a cover of the Bjork song). It has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million. It was led by &quot;Attack&quot;, which made its radio debut on June 6, 2005 and became the most added track on American modern rock radio during its first week of release. During 2005, Thirty Seconds to Mars released the album&#x27;s second single, &quot;The Kill&quot;, which set a record for the longest-running hit in the history of the US Modern Rock chart when it remained on the national chart for more than 50 weeks, following its number three peak in 2006. Its music video, directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award. This Is War - 2009 This is War released through Virgin Records and EMI on December 8, 2009. Upon its release, it peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200. Leto described the style as &quot;much more electronic and experimental, with lots of vintage synths. &quot; Leto also mentioned that he had written lyrics about some themes he felt were missing from their previous work, such as optimism and sexuality only for the song &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;. The music video for the song &quot;Hurricane&quot; was banned by MTV and several other TV channels around the world. The video, which runs for 13 minutes and 10 seconds and was directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbin, premiered on MTV on November 29, 2010. The video was censored and banned because of its elements of violence, nudity and sex. On November 28, 2010, Jared Leto posted the letter from MTV about the censorship of the video on his blog. The list features the offending scenes, such as a woman running her finger on the anus of another G-string woman, which was classified as &quot;restricted&quot;. It was only this shot which had made the video completely restricted. Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams - 2013 Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (stylized as LOVE LUST FAITH + DREAMS) was released through Virgin Records on May 17, 2013. Upon release, peaked #6 on the Billboard 200 and sold 52,000 copies in its first week of release. Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams is a concept album revolving around the themes after which the album is named. The album is divided into four segments, each named Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, with the beginning of each segment declared by a female voice proclaiming the name of the segment before the beginning of a song or at the end of an interlude which introduces the next segment of the album. A more specific album concept can be seen inside the CD. It is recognized by four colors, with the color red standing for Love, yellow for Lust, green for Faith, and blue for Dreams. LOVE contains &quot;Birth&quot; and &quot;Conquistador&quot;. LUST contains &quot;Up in the Air&quot;, &quot;City of Angels&quot;, &quot;The Race&quot;, &quot;End of All Days&quot; and &quot;Pyres of Varanasi&quot;.

The mission was launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on March 1, 2013, sending the first ever commercial copy of music into space. The spacecraft berthed and docked with the International Space Station on March 3, 2013, making the single available to play by the Expedition 35 crew aboard the station.

The band consists of M. Shadows (vocals), Synyster Gates (guitar), Zacky Vengeance (guitar) and Johnny Christ (bass). The band&#x27;s drummer James &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan died in 2009, and the band has not named a permanent replacement. Currently, the band tours with former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay. The band has released five albums since their formation: &quot;Sounding the Seventh Trumpet&quot; (2001), &quot;Waking the Fallen&quot; (2003), &quot;City of Evil&quot; (2005), &quot;Avenged Sevenfold&quot; (2007) and &quot;Nightmare&quot; (2010). The band was formed in 1999. Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s first album, Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, was recorded when the band members were eighteen years old. It was originally released on their first label, Good life Recordings. After lead guitarist Synyster Gates (also known by Brian Haner Jr. ) joined the band, the introductory track &quot;To End The Rapture&quot; was re-recorded with Gates playing, and the album was re-released on Hopeless Records. Their follow-up album, entitled Waking the Fallen, was also released on Hopeless Records and was awarded a positive rating in Rolling Stone magazine. Shortly after its release, Avenged Sevenfold were signed to Warner Bros. Records. City of Evil, the third album which was released on June 7 2005, strayed from metalcore, and instead headed more towards heavy metal and adds a harder rock sound with influences ranging from various bands. During the recording of City of Evil, M. Shadows&#x27; vocal styling changed to focus more on melodic singing rather than hardcore screaming. Some cite the change in vocal style as consequence of vocal chord damage (that resulted in subsequent surgery) during a tour supporting Waking the Fallen. Shadows denies the injury as being the reason. In the &quot;All Excess&quot; DVD, producer Mudrock clarifies this subject and affirms this is not the reason why the band changed style. He says &quot;One thing I see on the Internet, and that I just want to set the record straight on is, when I met the band, before they recorded Waking The Fallen, Matt handed me the CD and said &quot;this record is screaming, the record we wanna make is half screaming and half singing. I don&#x27;t wanna scream anymore, but I&#x27;m going to make a record that&#x27;s half singing and half screaming, and a record after that is going to be only singing&quot;. The already knew they wanted to make a singing record right by the time City Of Evil came out, that was two years before it came out, that&#x27;s what the band wanted to do as artists. &quot; The band&#x27;s name is a reference to the book of Genesis in the Bible where Cain is sentenced to live in exile for the crime of murdering his brother. God marked him so that none would kill him on account of his sin; the man who dared to kill Cain would have &quot;vengeance taken upon him sevenfold. &quot; The title of Avenged Sevenfold&#x27;s song &quot;Chapter Four&quot; references Genesis 4:15, the chapter of the Bible in which the story of Cain and Abel takes place. The song&#x27;s subject also appears to be this story. &quot;Beast and the Harlot&quot;, yet another song derived from the Bible, comes from the book of Revelation only it is written in the first person and refers to the punishment of Babylon the Great, world empire and seat of false religion. Another Bible reference occurs in the song &quot;The Wicked End&quot;. In the song, several times it is said &quot;dust the apple off, savor each bite, and deep inside you know Adam was right. &quot; making reference to Eve eating the forbidden fruit. Although the band&#x27;s title and members&#x27; stage names make references to religion, Shadows stated in an interview that they are &quot;not really religious at all. &quot; &quot;Anyone that read the lyrics and really knew anything about us, they would know we&#x27;re not promoting either&quot;, he said. &quot;That&#x27;s one thing about this band that I love is that we never really shove any kind of, like, political or religious beliefs on people. We just, the music&#x27;s there to entertain and maybe thought-provoking on both sides, but we don&#x27;t try to, like, really shove anything down anyone&#x27;s throat. There&#x27;s too many bands that do that nowadays, I think. &quot; The song &quot;Bat Country&quot; is a reference to the book/movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The song is dedicated to the Author of the book, the late Hunter S. Thompson. Their song &quot;Blinded In Chains&quot; was used in the soundtrack for the video games Need for Speed: Most Wanted and Arena Football. &quot;Bat Country&quot; was used in the soundtracks for SSX on Tour, NHL 06 and Madden 06, following in the footsteps of &quot;Chapter Four&quot; which had also been on the soundtrack for NHL 2004, Madden 2004 and NASCAR Thunder 2004. The song &quot;Beast and the Harlot&quot; was in the soundtrack for Burnout Revenge. All the above games, not coincidentally, are produced by various divisions of Electronic Arts. &quot;Beast and the Harlot&quot; also appears in RedOctane&#x27;s Guitar Hero II, released in November 7, 2006. The song &quot;Burn it Down&quot; is featured on the October 24, 2006 release of the Saw III soundtrack. During recent tours (Spring 2006 and Ozzfest 2006 tours) Avenged Sevenfold have been performing the song &quot;Walk&quot;, originally by Pantera, as part of a tribute to the late Dimebag Darrell Lance Abbott. At the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards, Avenged Sevenfold received the award for best new artist. They took the award over several other artists like Angels &amp; Airwaves and James Blunt. After canceling fall and winter 2006 tour dates, the band is planning their unnamed fourth studio album. M. Shadows has stated that it will not be a City of Evil Part 2 or Waking the Fallen Part 2, because they want to change their sound once more. They say it will be somewhat of a surprise to their fans. Some people are rejecting their new sounds, as some are embracing it. The band released their first DVD, Avenged Sevenfold : All Excess on July 17, 2007. Avenged Sevenfold, the band&#x27;s fourth album, was released on October 30, 2007, debuting at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 with over 90,000 copies sold. Two singles, &quot;Critical Acclaim&quot; and &quot;Almost Easy&quot; were released prior to the album&#x27;s debut. In December 2007, an animated video was made for &quot;A Little Piece of Heaven. &quot; Due to the song&#x27;s controversial subject matter, however, Warner Brothers only released it to registered MVI users over the internet. The third single, &quot;Afterlife&quot; and its video was released in January 2008. Their fourth single, &quot;Dear God&quot;, was released on June 15, 2008. Although critical reception was generally mixed the self-titled album went on to sell over 500,000 copies and was awarded &quot;Album of the Year&quot; at the Kerrang! Awards. Avenged Sevenfold headlined the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour with Atreyu, Bullet for My Valentine, Blessthefall and Idiot Pilot. They used the footage from their last show in Long Beach for Live in the LBC &amp; Diamonds in the Rough, a two-disc B-sides CD and live DVD which was released on September 16, 2008. They also recorded numerous covers, including Pantera&#x27;s &quot;Walk&quot;, Iron Maiden&#x27;s &quot;Flash of the Blade&quot; and Black Sabbath&#x27;s &quot;Paranoid&quot;. In January 2009, M. Shadows confirmed that the band was writing the follow-up to their self-titled fourth album within the upcoming months. They also announced that they will be playing at Rock on the Range, from May 16-17, 2009. On April 16, they performed a version of Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot; onstage with Slash, at the Nokia Theater in Los Angeles. On December 28, 2009, drummer James &quot;The Rev&quot; Sullivan was found dead at his home at the age of 28. Autopsy results were inconclusive, but on June 9, 2010, the cause of death was revealed to have been an &quot;acute polydrug intoxication due to combined effects of Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Diazepam/Nordiazepam and ethanol&quot;. In a statement by the band, they expressed their grief over the passing of The Rev and later posted a message from Sullivan&#x27;s family which expressed their gratitude to his fans for their support. he band members admitted in a number of interviews that they considered disbanding at this point of time. However, on February 17, 2010, Avenged Sevenfold stated that they had entered the studio, along with now-former Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy, to drum for the record, in place of the Rev. The single &quot;Nightmare&quot; was digitally released on May 18, 2010. A preview for the song was released on May 6, 2010 on Amazon. com, but was removed soon after for unknown reasons. Mixing for the album had been completed in New York City, and Nightmare was finally released worldwide on July 27, 2010. It met with mixed to positive reviews from music critics but was well received by the fans. Nightmare beat sales projections easily, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200 with sales of 163,000 units in its first week. After finishing recording, in December, Portnoy and the band posted simultaneous statements on their websites stating that he will not be their replacement for The Rev. However, Portnoy did travel with the band overseas in December 2010 for three shows in Iraq and Kuwait sponsored by the USO. They played for US Soldiers at Camp Adder, Camp Beuhring, and Balad Air Base. On January 20, 2011, Avenged Sevenfold announced via Facebook that former Confide drummer Arin Ilejay will tour with them starting this year. Whether or not he will be joining the band on a permanent basis has not been decided yet. Avenged Sevenfold performed at the Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals on June 3-5, 2011 alongside other bands such as Alter Bridge, System of a Down, and In Flames. On April 2011, the band headlined the Golden God Awards held by Metal Hammer. The same night the band won three awards for &quot;Best Vocalist&quot; (M.

HEALTH is an noise rock band consisting of four members including Benjamin Jared Miller, Jake Duzsik, John Famiglietti, and Jupiter Keyes. All are from different cities including Seattle, San Diego, and their current home base, Los Angeles.

HEALTH plan to tour continuously doing what they love and do best, make eccentric and original music. Jake met Jupiter in college. John met Jake in a guitar store. Jared was drawn to the fold by way of Internet courtship. The band is often considered noise rock, but besides having some slight elements of the genre, they don't fit the sound of other, current bands included in the noise rock scene, due to them mixing such genres as dance and electronica. They have several releases to date, including one self-titled full length, a split with good friends Crystal Castles, another split with art punk band Elphaba, two tour CD-R's, and one Tape release of them performing Live at the smell. 2.

The current members are vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Brendon Urie and bassist Dallon Weekes. Their debut album A Fever You Can&#x27;t Sweat Out has sold over 2. 2 million copies worldwide, 1. 5 million of which were in the United States alone. This shot them into the international spotlight. Their sophomore album Pretty. Odd. debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200. The band released their third album, entitled Vices &amp; Virtues, on March 22, 2011, while the record&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Ballad of Mona Lisa&quot; was released February 1, 2011. Although the band officially formed as Panic! at the Disco in 2004, the first incarnation of the band was formed in 2002 under the name &quot;Pet Salamander&quot;, with Ryan Ross, Spencer Smith, Brent Wilson, and Trevor Howell. It was during this time that Ryan Ross wrote &quot;Time To Dance&quot; and &quot;I Write Sins Not Tragedies&quot;, so some consider the band to have formed as of 2002. In 2005, Panic! at the Disco, which at the time included Urie, Smith, guitarist/lyricist Ryan Ross, and bassist Brent Wilson, was discovered by Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy, who, after hearing demos the band uploaded to PureVolume went to Las Vegas to hear the band play in their garage. He immediately signed them to his Fueled By Ramen label imprint Decaydance. After their debut A Fever You Can&#x27;t Sweat Out was released, bassist Brent Wilson left the band. Although he claims he was fired, the other members deny this. The success of their first two singles helped catapult their debut album to the top of the Billboard Independent chart and to #13 on the Billboard 200 in July 2006. With Jon Walker filling in as temporary bassist, the band embarked on their first headlining tour through Europe. All of the dates sold out within hours. Immediately after returning, they did the same in North America. On July 3, Jon Walker became the permanent bassist of Panic! at the Disco. In early 2007, Panic! at the Disco began writing their follow up album but, after months of work, decided to rewrite the entire album from scratch in July 2007. While speaking to MTV, Ryan Ross explained that, before the decision to start over was made, the album had lacked a band set up and that it &quot;sounded like a film score. &quot; He also explained that the new songs have &quot;a more positive outlook to them. &quot; On January 9, the exclamation point (!) in the band&#x27;s name was dropped. They defended the decision to drop the exclamation point during an interview with MTV: &quot;It was never part of the name to us. (&#8230;) When we started doing new promo stuff for this album, we just told everyone not to use it anymore. &quot; Panic (sans &quot;!&quot;) later confirmed that the second album was titled Pretty. Odd. with a release date of March 25, 2008. On July 6th, 2009, an announcement was put up on the band&#x27;s official website and myspace page, stating that Ryan Ross and Jon Walker would be leaving the band to pursue their own musical interests. They have since formed the band The Young Veins. Brendon Urie and Spencer Smith, however, will stay and continue playing as Panic! at the Disco, with the exclamation point re-added. Fans can hear a snippet of Panic!&#x27;s demo entitled &quot;Oh Glory&quot; on the band&#x27;s official website. Since the split, Panic! at the Disco joined Fall Out Boy, Blink-182, and Chester French on the first half of Blink-182&#x27;s summer tour in 2009. They brought along Ian Crawford formerly of The Cab and Dallon Weekes of The Brobecks to temporarily replace Ross and Walker. The band also released a single titled New Perspective which was featured on the Jennifer&#x27;s Body Soundtrack in August 2009. &quot;New Perspective&quot; was released on July 28, 2009. Former The Cab member Ian Crawford filled in for Ross on their tour during the summer of 2009. Dallon Weekes, singer/songwriter of the indie band The Brobecks, filled in for Walker on bass on the tour as well. The band re-entered the studio during early 2010 and spent much of the year recording their third studio album. On January 18, 2011, the band revealed that their new album, Vices &amp; Virtues, would officially be released on March 22, 2011. The album was produced by Butch Walker and John Feldmann. The record&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Ballad of Mona Lisa&quot;, was released digitally on February 1, 2011, with the music video being released February 8, 2011. The band played 2 new, unheard songs &quot;Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met&#8230;)&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Tonight&quot; at recent concerts. On March 9, 2011, Panic! at The Disco released a short film titled &quot;The Overture&quot; which featured snippets of four, unheard songs: &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Tonight&quot;, &quot;Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Ready to Go (Get Me Out of My Mind)&quot;, and &quot;Nearly Witches (Ever Since We Met&#8230;)&quot;. On March 14, 2011, Panic! at The Disco streamed the full Vices &amp; Virtues album on their Facebook page. ", "The Dear Hunter": "The Dear Hunter, Providence, RI, is the full-time progressive rock project of Casey Crescenzo, formerly of post-hardcore band The Receiving End of Sirens. The band got its name from the lead character of the story that he wrote to go along with the music. The sound is unlike that of Casey&#x27;s former band, with musical roots deep-set in the progressive rock genre and utilizing a wider variety of instrumentation. The band began as a side project of Casey Crescenzo when he was full time member of the Boston, Massachusetts band The Receiving End of Sirens. It was originally intended as a vehicle for music Casey had written that didn&#x27;t fit with the heavier sound of The Receiving End of Sirens. In the winter of 2005 Casey recorded the Dear Ms. Leading demos. He created 10 copies of the demos on burned CDs intended for the ears of friends, and they began circulation. At the time he did not plan to pursue The Dear Hunter full time and allowed the demos to be placed online for download. On February 2, 2006, The Dear Hunter played its first show with The Receiving End of Sirens as the backing band. In May 2006, Casey left The Receiving End of Sirens and began work on The Dear Hunter&#x27;s first studio album. He expanded the scope of the project to a six-album story set at the dawn of the 20th century about the birth, life, and abrupt death of a boy, known only in the story as &quot;The Dear Hunter. &quot; In a 2007 interview with music website Absolutepunk. net, Casey stated that he already has the overall story of The Dear Hunter mapped out, with each act in 1-3 page treatments. Casey produced and recorded the EP by himself with only of the help of his brother on drums and mother on backing vocals. Act I: The Lake South, The River North was released in September 2006 on Triple Crown Records. Shortly after the EP&#x27;s release, Casey recruited Luke Dent of the recently split band Faraway for vocals and keyboards and Erick Serna as a second guitarist. Luke brought in his brother Sam Dent on drums and Erick brought long-time friend Josh Rheault in to play bass. The complete band entered the studio in late 2006 to record the follow-up to Act I. Recording finished in early 2007. Act II: The Meaning of, and All Things Regarding Ms. Leading was released May 22, 2007, only eight months after the band&#x27;s previous release. The band recently finished filming a music video for the song The Church and the Dime. They have also announced that they are currently working on nine albums, each of which is inspired by a different color of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet), with black and white added as bookends. They will include many guest appearances, and will span many different genres of music. Casey has said that the band&#x27;s main focus will still be the Act albums and music, but that each of the color albums will be from 30 to 60 minutes in length. A book based on the story of Act II is currently in the works. Artist Kent St. John was selected to do the illustrations, the progress of which can be seen on his blog. Prior to a string of dates with Circa Survive, Josh Rheault and brothers Sam and Luke Dent all left the band.

Although he recorded only three albums, critics and fellow musicians hold his work in very high esteem. Drake failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, and had a strong aversion to performing. Since his death, however, Drake&#x27;s music has gained a significant cult following. Drake&#x27;s father worked as an engineer. Although he was born in Rangoon, Burma, Nick&#x27;s family moved back to England soon afterward, and Drake was brought up in Tanworth-in-Arden, a small village in the English county of Warwickshire. He went to public school at Marlborough College, where he learned to play the clarinet and piano. As a young adult, Drake enrolled in Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, to study English. His older sister, Gabrielle Drake, is an actress. Drake was a fan of British and the emerging American folk music scene, including artists Bob Dylan and Phil Ochs. While a university student, Drake began performing in local clubs and coffee houses. He was discovered by Ashley Hutchings, the bass player of the folk rock group Fairport Convention. Hutchings introduced Drake to the other members of Fairport Convention, folk singer John Martyn and producer Joe Boyd. He delayed attendance to spend six months at the University of Aix-Marseille, France, beginning in February 1967. While in Aix, he began to practice guitar in earnest, and to earn money would often busk with friends in the town centre. Drake began to smoke cannabis, and that spring he travelled with friends to Morocco, because, according to travelling companion Richard Charkin, &quot;that was where you got the best pot&quot;. Drake&#x27;s associates convinced Island Records to sign the young singer-songwriter to a three-album contract. Drake began recording his debut album Five Leaves Left later in 1968, with Boyd assuming the role of producer. The sessions took place in Sound Techniques studio, London, with Drake skipping lectures to travel by train to the capital. At the age of twenty, he released his first album Five Leaves Left (1969), which featured a chamber music quartet on several songs and had a light, breezy sound. Drake&#x27;s second album Bryter Layter (1970) introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound, with keyboards, horns and several brass instruments. Both albums were produced by Boyd and featured several members of Fairport Convention. Many accounts of Drake focus on his mythology, but a large part of his enduring popularity is due to his meticulous songwriting, prosody, odd guitar tunings and lyricism. Drake was pathologically shy and resented touring. The few concerts he did play were usually in support of other British folk acts of the time, such as Fairport Convention or John Martyn and were often brief and awkward. Partially because of this, his work received little attention and sold poorly. Whilst in the recording studio, he was so shy that he&#x27;d always play into the wall so as to avoid people&#x27;s gazes. Severely depressed and doubting his abilities as a musician, Drake recorded his final album Pink Moon (1972) in two two-hour sessions, both starting at midnight. The songs of Pink Moon were short (the album consists of eleven of them and lasts only 28 minutes) and emotionally bleak. Drake recorded them unaccompanied, in the presence of only a sound engineer (a piano was later overdubbed on the title track). Naked and sincere, it is widely thought to be his best work. At this point he considered other careers including the army and as a computer programmer, but more suitably as a songwriter for other artists. However, none of Drake&#x27;s plans materialized. In the next few months, Drake grew severely depressed and maintained relationships only with close friends such as John Martyn, who wrote the title song of his 1973 album Solid Air for and about Drake and with Sophia Ryde. He was hospitalized several times and lived with Hardy for a few months. Friends from that time have described how much his appearance changed: his nails grown, his hair and frame gaunt and thin. In 1974, Drake felt well enough to write and record a few new songs. However, on November 25, he died of an overdose of antidepressants. The coroner concluded that the cause of Drake&#x27;s death was suicide, although this was disputed by friends and relatives. Antidepressants of that time were quite lethal if ingested in any higher dosage than the one prescribed. His mother recounts that he must have had difficulty sleeping and had got up in the night to have a bowl of cornflakes. It&#x27;s unclear whether he took more pills to help him sleep or to take his own life. His simple gravestone in the Tanworth churchyard bears the line &quot;And now we rise/And we are everywhere&quot;, taken from From the Morning - the last song on the last album Nick lived to complete. Posthumous popularity Since Drake's death, his music has grown steadily in popularity. Several modern musicians, such as Lucinda Williams, Badly Drawn Boy, Matthew Good, Sebadoh&#x27;s Lou Barlow, R. E. M. guitarist Peter Buck, Blur's Graham Coxon, and Belle and Sebastian, consider Drake an important influence. In early 1999, BBC2 aired a 40-minute Nick Drake documentary, &quot;A Stranger Among Us -- In Search of Nick Drake&quot;, as part of its Picture This strand. The following year saw the release of a documentary by Dutch director Jeroen Berkvens, titled A Skin Too Few: The Days of Nick Drake and featuring interviews with Joe Boyd, Gabrielle Drake, audio engineer John Wood and arranger Robert Kirby. Brad Pitt is a fan of Drake and, in 2004, he narrated a BBC radio documentary about the singer. Island has responded to Drake's popularity with several new releases including Time of No Reply (1986), an album of unreleased material including four new songs recorded in 1974, Way to Blue: An Introduction to Nick Drake (1994), a &quot;best of&quot; album, remastered HDCD releases of his three studio albums in 2000, and Made to Love Magic (2004), featuring one new track and some newly recorded orchestration for a previously released track. A replacement for Way to Blue called A Treasury was also released in 2004 on Hybrid-SACD. In 2000, Volkswagen licensed the track Pink Moon, the title track from Nick&#x27;s third release, for a particularly serene car commercial in the US . The advertisement caused a significant bounce in Drake's popularity, bolstered by uses of Drake&#x27;s music on a number of film soundtracks, including 1998&#x27;s Hideous Kinky and Practical Magic (featuring &quot;Road&quot; from Pink Moon and &quot;Black Eyed Dog&quot; from Time of No Reply , respectively). In 2001, two Bryter Layter tracks appeared in mainstream films: &quot;Northern Sky&quot; in Serendipity, and &quot;Fly&quot; in The Royal Tenenbaums. In the same year, &quot;Cello Song&quot; from Five Leaves Left was featured in Me Without You. In 2004, &quot;One of These Things First&quot; appeared in Garden State and &quot;Northern Sky&quot; was featured again, this time in Fever Pitch. Drake&#x27;s &quot;River Man&quot; has become quite popular among Jazz musicians. A piano improvisation based on the melody was released by Brad Mehldau on the album &quot;Progression: Art Of The Trio, Volume 5&quot;, and a Jazz vocal version by Claire Martin appears on the album Take My Heart. Drake&#x27;s posthumous popularity has made many fans consider the lyrics to &quot;Fruit Tree&quot; a song from Five Leaves Left prophetic: \"Fame is but a fruit tree / So very unsound. / It can never flourish / Till its stock is in the ground. / So men of fame / Can never find a way / Till time has flown / Far from their dying day. \" In 2004 two of his singles reached low positions in the UK charts - &quot;Magic&quot; and &quot;River Man&quot;. Most recently, Nick Drake has emerged as a key influence in the resurgence of 1960&#x27;s and 1970&#x27;s folk traditions, apparent in the works of artists including Devendra Banhart, Joanna Newsom, and Six Organs of Admittance. In 2005, performer Beck updated his website during Christmas time with covers of three songs from Pink Moon : &quot;Pink Moon&quot;, &quot;Which Will&quot; and &quot;Parasite. &quot; Family Tree, the next Bryter Music/Island record was released in July, 2007.

In 2011, they released an album called The Path of Totality and with the album, they added sounds and instruments of dubstep with their nu metal sound. The Get Up! Songfacts reports that Korn&#x27;s 10th studio album, The Path Of Totality was produced by various dubstep, drum and bass, and electro house artists due to the band&#x27;s desire to fuse their traditional sound with electronic elements. released on December 2, 2011 in Europe and December 6, 2011 in the US. Davis explained the album title: &quot;The title The Path of Totality refers to the fact that in order to see the sun in a full solar eclipse, you must be in the exact right place in the exact right time. That&#x27;s how this album came together. I think all the producers feel the same way. I&#x27;m not sure it could ever happen again. &quot; Korn currently has over 36 singles, over 25 of which have charted. The band has over 5 video albums and over 34 music videos. Korn has sold over 19 million albums in the US, and over 40 million worldwide. Ten of the band&#x27;s official releases have peaked in the top ten of the Billboard 200, eight of which have peaked in the top five. Eight of those releases are certified Platinum by the RIAA, and one is certified Gold. Korn have also earned seven Grammy nominations -- two of which they have won (for &quot;Freak on a Leash&quot; and &quot;Here to Stay&quot;). Korn say they will release a new album soon in 2013, saying it will be aggressive, heavy and having &quot;in your face!&quot; vocals and to sound like their roots. Brain Welch also says he will perform at some concerts with them in January 2013. He also says he will later on rejoin the band. But he left the band originally to rededicate his life back to Christianity. While David, left and opened a bar in Bakersfield, California. They were the first band to be labeled as nu metal, people say they were starting the New Wave of American Heavy Metal. Alongside this genre, the band has also been labeled as heavy metal, rap metal, funk metal, groove metal, rap rock, alternative metal and industrial metal. Their debut album mixed metal with grunge and hip-hop. Their lyrics focus mostly on stuff like personal alienation, pain, social anger, issues, memories, personal views and thoughts and sometimes revenge. In Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock &amp; Punk, Korn was marked as the third biggest nu metal band in the world. The band, especially their frontman Jonathan have rejected the metal label. Although Munky said he never considered the band as nu metal. In their Issues album, they reduced slightly the rap sounds they had, but returned to it with Take a Look in the Mirror going back to their roots and being very aggressive, but with See You On the Other Side, they took influences from industrial metal but went back to the sound of Untouchables and Issues with their Untitled album. These are examples of their musical style and direction.

Junk Of The Heart was released September 12, 2011. The Kooks formed at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music, where they were all students. Lead singer and rhythm guitarist Luke Pritchard, got bassist Max Rafferty involved in a college project, which formed the base of the band. After getting lead guitarist Hugh Harris and drummer Paul Garred involved, they took their name from the song Kooks on the 1971 David Bowie album Hunky Dory. When they tried to trademark the name, they found that in the late/mid 1990s a Swedish band by the same name released an album in Sweden called Too Much is Not Enough. The Kooks released a debut EP and played gigs around Brighton, where they were based at the time. They were signed to Virgin Records. 2.

", "Children of Bodom": "Children of Bodom is a Finnish band from the city of Espoo, near Helsinki. The name of the band comes from one of the most famous Finnish murder cases of all time. (The murdering of three teenagers one night at Lake Bodom back in the 60&#x27;s. ) Early Children of Bodom albums are inspired by classical music and death metal (Red Light in My Eyes pt. 1 starts with a line from J. S. Bach&#x27;s Invention No. 13 in A minor and Red Light in My Eyes pt. 2 includes selections from Mozart&#x27;s 25th Symphony), and later albums are more inspired by a commercial thrash and hair metal, losing some of its earlier melodic style. A precise definition for their musical genre is discussed by fans and the specialized press alike, often discounting the influences of the band and the composition of songs. The lyrics of their songs are written in the English language and are often of a simplistic nature, dealing with the subjects of death and personal struggles. As the band grows in experience, so does their playing style. They seem to change one way or another with every album that gets released. Even the album cover arts seems to change as the band grows. They are now also hitting the mainstream part of metal, their name and style being more known now. COB continues to inspire many musicians alike and more join the COBHC everyday.

", "Foo Fighters": "Foo Fighters are an American rock band formed by singer/guitarist/drummer Dave Grohl in 1995 in Seattle, USA. Grohl formed the group as a one-man project after the dissolution of his previous band Nirvana in 1994. Prior to the release of Foo Fighters in 1995, Grohl drafted Nate Mendel (bass), William Goldsmith (drums) (both of Sunny Day Real Estate and The Fire Theft), and Pat Smear (guitar) (of The Germs) to complete the group. Goldsmith left during the recording of the group&#x27;s second album The Colour and the Shape (1997), soon followed by Smear. They were replaced by Taylor Hawkins and Franz Stahl, respectively, although Stahl left prior to the recording of the group&#x27;s third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose (1999). Chris Shiflett joined as the band&#x27;s second guitarist after the completion of There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The band released its fourth album One by One in 2002. The group followed that release with the two-disc In Your Honor (2005), which was split between acoustic songs and harder-rocking material. Foo Fighters released its sixth album Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace in 2007. Over the course of the band&#x27;s career, three of its albums have won Grammy Awards for Best Rock Album, and all six have been nominated for Grammys. The band&#x27;s seventh album Wasting Light was released in 2011 and peaked at #1 in several countries. Formation and debut album Dave Grohl joined the band Nirvana as the group&#x27;s drummer in 1990. In order to occupy himself during tours, he took a guitar with him and wrote songs. Grohl held back these songs from the band; he said in 1997, &quot;I was in awe of frontman Kurt Cobain&#x27;s songs. And intimidated. I thought it was best that I keep my songs to myself. &quot; Instead, Grohl occasionally booked studio time to record demos, and even issued a cassette of some of those songs called Pocketwatch under the pseudonym &quot;Late!&quot; in 1992. Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 8, 1994, and Nirvana subsequently disbanded. Grohl received offers to work with various artists, and almost accepted a permanent position as the drummer in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Ultimately Grohl declined and instead entered a studio in October 1994 to record twelve of the forty songs he had written. With the exception of a guitar part on &quot;X-Static&quot; by Greg Dulli of the Afghan Whigs, Grohl played every instrument and sang every vocal on the tracks. &quot;I was supposed to just join another band and be a drummer the rest of my life,&quot; Grohl later said. &quot;I thought that I would rather do what no-one expected me to do. I enjoy writing music and I enjoy trying to sing, and there&#x27;s nothing anyone can really do to discourage me. &quot; Grohl completed an album&#x27;s worth of material in five days and handed out cassette copies of the sessions to his friends for feedback. Grohl hoped to keep his anonymity and release the recordings in a limited run under the title &quot;Foo Fighters&quot;, taken from the World War II term &quot;foo fighter&quot;, used to refer to unidentified flying objects. According to Rope Songfacts , he was reading a book about military World War II sightings at the time and he wanted people to think it was a band. So he called it Foo Fighters as it was plural. However, the demo tape circulated in the music industry, creating interest among record labels. Grohl formed a band to support the album. Initially, Grohl talked to former Nirvana band mate Krist Novoselic about joining the group, but both decided against it. &quot;For Krist and I, it would have felt really natural and really great&quot;, Grohl explained. &quot;But for everyone else, it would have been weird, and it would have left me in a really bad position. Then I really would have been under the microscope. &quot; Having heard about the disbanding of Seattle-based emo band Sunny Day Real Estate, Grohl drafted the group&#x27;s bass player, Nate Mendel, and drummer, William Goldsmith. Grohl asked Pat Smear, who served touring guitarist for Nirvana after the release of its 1993 album In Utero, to join as the group&#x27;s second guitarist. Grohl ultimately licensed the album to Capitol Records, releasing it on his new record label, Roswell Records. The group played its debut show at a keg party in February 1995. Grohl refused to do interviews or tour large venues to promote the album. Foo Fighters undertook their first major tour in the spring of 1995, opening for Mike Watt. The band&#x27;s first single &quot;This Is a Call&quot; was released in June 1995, and its debut album Foo Fighters was released the next month. &quot;I&#x27;ll Stick Around&quot;, &quot;For All The Cows&quot; and &quot;Big Me&quot; were released as subsequent singles. The band spent the following months on tour, including their first appearance at the Reading Festival in England in August. The Colour and the Shape After touring through the spring of 1996, Foo Fighters entered a studio in Woodinville, Washington with producer Gil Norton to record its second album. While Grohl once again wrote all the songs, the rest of the band collaborated on the arrangements. With the sessions nearly complete, Grohl took the rough mixes with him to Los Angeles, intending to finish up his vocal and guitar parts. While there, Grohl realized that he wasn&#x27;t happy with how the mixes were turning out, and the band &quot;basically re-recorded almost everything&quot;. During the L. A. sessions, Grohl played drums on some of the songs. Goldsmith said Grohl did not tell him that he recorded new drum parts for the record and, feeling betrayed, left the band. In need of a replacement for Goldsmith, Grohl contacted Alanis Morissette&#x27;s touring drummer Taylor Hawkins to see if he could recommend anybody. Grohl was surprised when Hawkins volunteered his own services as drummer. Hawkins made his debut with the group in time for the release of its second album, The Colour and the Shape, in May 1997. The album spawned the singles &quot;Monkey Wrench&quot;, &quot;My Hero&quot;, and &quot;Everlong&quot;. Pat Smear announced to the rest of the group that he wanted to leave the band to pursue other interests. Four months later in September 1997 at the MTV Video Music Awards, Smear simultaneously publicly announced his departure from the band and introduced his replacement, Grohl&#x27;s former Scream bandmate Franz Stahl. Stahl toured with the band for the next few months, and appeared on two tracks that the band recorded for movie soundtracks, a re-recording of &quot;Walking After You&quot; for The X-Files and &quot;A320&quot; for Godzilla. There Is Nothing Left to Lose In 1998, Foo Fighters traveled to Grohl&#x27;s home state of Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, &quot;In those few weeks it just seemed like the three of us were moving in one direction and Franz wasn&#x27;t&quot;. Grohl was distraught about the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band&#x27;s third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl&#x27;s Virginia home studio. The album spawned several singles, including &quot;Learn to Fly&quot;, the band&#x27;s first single to reach the US Hot 100. Before the release of the album, Capitol president Gary Gersh was forced out of the label. Given Grohl&#x27;s history with Gersh, Foo Fighters&#x27; contract had included a &quot;key man clause&quot; that allowed them to leave the label upon Gersh&#x27;s departure. They subsequently left Capitol and signed to RCA, who later acquired the rights to the band&#x27;s Capitol albums. Chris Shiflett joined Foo Fighters as a touring guitarist before becoming a full member After recording was completed, the band auditioned a number of potential guitarists, and eventually settled on Chris Shiflett, who previously performed with No Use for a Name and Me First and the Gimme Gimmes. Shiflett initially joined the band as touring guitarist, but achieved full-time status prior to the recording of the group&#x27;s fourth album. That same year, Foo Fighters established a relationship with rock band Queen, of whom the band (particularly Grohl and Hawkins) are fans. Guitarist Brian May added a guitar track to Foo Fighters&#x27; second cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Have a Cigar&quot;, which appeared on the soundtrack to the movie Mission Impossible 2. When Queen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March 2001, Grohl and Hawkins were invited to perform with the band on &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;, with Grohl filling in on vocals for Freddie Mercury. In 2002, guitarist May contributed guitar work to &quot;Tired of You&quot; and an outtake called &quot;Knucklehead&quot;. The bands have performed together on several occasions since, including VH1 Rock Honors and Foo Fighters&#x27; headlining concert in Hyde Park. One by One Near the end of 2001, the band reconvened to record their fourth album. After spending four months in a Los Angeles studio completing the album, Grohl spent some time helping Queens of the Stone Age complete their 2002 album Songs for the Deaf. Once the Queens of the Stone Age album was finished, Grohl, inspired by the sessions, decided to reconvene Foo Fighters to rework a few songs on their album. Instead, they re-recorded nearly all of the album (save &quot;Tired of You&quot;) in a ten-day stretch at Grohl&#x27;s studio in Virginia. The final album was released in October of 2002 under the title One by One. Singles from the album included &quot;All My Life&quot;, &quot;Times Like These&quot;, &quot;Low&quot;, and &quot;Have It All&quot;. The band later expressed displeasure with the album. Grohl told Rolling Stone in 2005, &quot;Four of the songs were good, and the other seven I never played again in my life. We rushed into it, and we rushed out of it. &quot; For most of its history, the band chose to stay away from the political realm. However, in 2004 prior to donating 3 million dollars to the new Pittsburgh Penguins arena, upon learning that George W. Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign was using &quot;Times Like These&quot; at rallies, Grohl decided to lend his public support to John Kerry&#x27;s campaign. Grohl attended several Kerry rallies and occasionally performed solo acoustic sets. The entire band eventually joined Grohl for a performance in Arizona coinciding with one of the presidential debates. In Your Honor and acoustic tour Having spent a year and a half touring behind One By One, Grohl did not want to rush into recording another Foo Fighters record. Initially Grohl intended to write acoustic material by himself, but eventually the project involved the entire band. To record its fifth album, the band shifted to Los Angeles and built a recording studio, dubbed Studio 606 West. Grohl insisted that the album be divided into two discs-one full of rock songs, the other featuring acoustic tracks. In Your Honor was released in June 2005. The album&#x27;s singles included &quot;Best of You&quot;, &quot;DOA&quot;, &quot;Resolve&quot;, &quot;No Way Back&quot;, and &quot;Miracle&quot;. On June 17, 2006, Foo Fighters performed their largest non-festival headlining concert to date at London&#x27;s Hyde Park. The band was supported by Juliette and the Licks, Angels &amp; Airwaves, Queens of the Stone Age, and Motorhead. Motorhead&#x27;s Lemmy joined the band on stage to sing &quot;Shake Your Blood&quot; from Dave Grohl&#x27;s Probot album. Also, as a surprise performance, Brian May and Roger Taylor of Queen jammed with Foo Fighters, playing part of &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; as a lead into &quot;Tie Your Mother Down&quot;. In further support of In Your Honor, the band decided to organize a short acoustic tour for the summer of 2006. The tour included former member Pat Smear, who rejoined the band as an extra guitarist, Petra Haden on violin and backup vocals, Drew Hester on percussion, and Rami Jaffee of The Wallflowers on keyboards/piano. While much of the setlist focused on In Your Honor&#x27;s acoustic half, the band also used the opportunity to play lesser-known songs such as &quot;Ain&#x27;t It The Life&quot;, &quot;Floaty&quot;, and &quot;See You&quot;. The band also performed &quot;Marigold&quot;, a Pocketwatch-era song that was best-known as a Nirvana B-side. In November 2006, the band released their first ever live CD, Skin and Bones, featuring fifteen performances captured over a three-night stand in Los Angeles. An accompanying DVD was released, and featured tracks not available on the CD. Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace For the follow-up to In Your Honor, the band decided to call in The Colour and the Shape producer Gil Norton. Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace was released in September 2007. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Pretender&quot;, was issued to radio in early August. The second single, &quot;Long Road to Ruin&quot;, was released in December 2007, supported by a music video directed by longtime collaborator Jesse Peretz (formerly of the Lemonheads). In mid-to-late 2007 &quot;The Pretender&quot; topped the Modern Rock chart for a record 18 weeks, it also gave the band their third consecutive year at the top (a record), and made them the only artist besides Red Hot Chili Peppers to have 4 consecutive albums have songs reach the top (RHCPs have 5). When &quot;Long Road to Ruin&quot; reached the top it gave them their fourth consecutive year to have a song reach the top (breaking their own record). When the fourth single, &quot;Let It Die&quot;, reached the top 20 it gave them 3 songs in the top 20, one of only four artists to do this. &quot;Let It Die&quot; is also the album&#x27;s third Number One hit on the chart. Not long after completing the recording sessions for the album, the band participated in Live Earth at Wembley Stadium in London, England, performing the penultimate set of the night. Later that summer, the band headlined V Festival 2007, including a surprise acoustic set on the Channel 4 stage under the name 606. In October 2007, Foo Fighters started their world tour in support for Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace. The band performed shows throughout the United States, Europe, Australia, Canada and Asia. The band finished its world tour in September 2008 at the Virgin Festival at Toronto Island Park in Canada. Echoes, Silence, Patience &amp; Grace was nominated for 5 Grammys in 2008. The Foo Fighters went home with Best Rock Album and Best Hard Rock Performance (for &quot;The Pretender&quot;). The album was also nominated for Album of the Year, while &quot;The Pretender&quot; was also nominated for Record of the Year and Best Rock Song. On 17 September 2008 Dave Grohl announced on The Chris Moyles Show that the band would be taking a long break from music so that they could return with a new sense of purpose, and also informed fans not to expect any new music for a while. &quot;We&#x27;ve never really taken a long break, I think it&#x27;s time,&quot; Grohl commented. &quot;After doing Wembley, we shouldn&#x27;t come back there for 10 years because we&#x27;ve played to everybody. We&#x27;re over in the UK every year, every summer, so I think it&#x27;s time to take a break and come back over when people really miss us. &quot; Wasting Light After taking a break from music, Foo Fighters returned in 2011 with the album Wasting Light. The album was recorded in Dave Grohl&#x27;s garage, as opposed to Studio 606. Grohl addressed by stating &quot;There&#x27;s poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage. &quot; Wasting Light features many guest musicians, including Krist Novoselic, who had played with Grohl in Nirvana. Foo Fighters released a 30 second teaser on January 17th 2011 of the song &quot;Bridge Burning&quot;, and on February 1st 2011 the announcement of the release date of the album, April 12th 2011, was accompanied by a 30 second teaser of &quot;Miss the Misery&quot;. On February 12th, the music video for &quot;White Limo&quot; was released. And on February 23rd &quot;Rope&quot; was released for online streaming. On March 1st &quot;Rope&quot; was released as the first single from the album. It peaked at number 1 in the US on the Rock, Alternative, and Mainstream Rock charts. On April 9th the band appeared on Saturday Night Live (host Helen Miren). They played the song &quot;Rope&quot; for their first performance, and debuted the song &quot;Walk&quot; for their second. Wasting Light peaked at number 1 on the Albums chart in 12 countries, including the US and UK. It has achieved platinum status in Australia and New Zeland. Musical style When Grohl first started the band, its music was often compared to that of his previous group, Nirvana. Grohl acknowledged that Nirvana singer/guitarist Kurt Cobain was a major influence on his songwriting. Grohl said, &quot;Through Kurt, I saw the beauty of minimalism and the importance of music that&#x27;s stripped down. &quot; Foo Fighters also utilize the Pixies&#x27; technique of shifting between quiet verses and loud chorus, which Grohl said was influenced by the members of Nirvana &quot;liking the Knack, Bay City Rollers, The Beatles, and Abba as much as we liked Flipper and Black Flag, I suppose&quot;. Writing and recording songs for the first Foo Fighters album by himself, Grohl wrote the guitar riffs to be as rhythmic as possible. He approached the guitar similar to how he approached playing a drumkit, assigning different drum parts to different strings on the instrument. This allowed him to piece together songs easily; he said, &quot;I could hear the song in my head before it was finished. &quot; Once Grohl assembled a full band, his bandmates assisted in song arrangements. The members of Foo Fighters meld melodic elements with harder sounds. Grohl noted in 1997, &quot;We all love music, whether it&#x27;s the Beatles or Queen or punk rock. I think the lure of punk rock was the energy and immediacy; the need to thrash stuff around. But at the same time, we&#x27;re all suckers for a beautiful melody, you know? So it is just natural. &quot; Campaigning and activism In 2000, the band generated controversy through their public support of Alive &amp; Well, an organization that denies the link between HIV and AIDS, questions the validity of HIV tests, and advises against taking medication to counter the disease. Foo Fighter bassist Nate Mendel learned of Alive &amp; Well through What If Everything You Thought You Knew about AIDS Was Wrong?, a self-published book written by Christine Maggiore, the organization&#x27;s founder. Mendel passed the book around to the rest of the band, who supported his advocacy. In January 2000, the band played a benefit concert for the organization, which Mendel helped to organize. The band also contributed songs to The Other Side of AIDS, a controversial documentary film by Maggiore&#x27;s husband Robin Scovill, which questions whether HIV is the cause of AIDS. The band&#x27;s position caused alarm in the medical community, as Alive &amp; Well&#x27;s advice ran contrary to established medical wisdom about HIV and AIDS. In a 2000 interview, Mendel spoke of using Foo Fighters&#x27; popularity to help spread the group&#x27;s message and of holding more benefits for the organization. However, no further benefits have taken place, and the band has since removed the organization from its list of supported causes. ", "Jimmy Cliff": "Jimmy Cliff OM (&gt; Jamaican Order of Merit) born as James Chambers (1 April 1948, St. Catherine, Jamaica) is a Jamaican reggae musician. He is best known among mainstream audiences for songs like &quot;Sittin&#x27; in Limbo&quot;, &quot;You Can Get It If You Really Want,&quot; &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; and the title track from The Harder They Come, a film soundtrack which helped popularise reggae across the world. Cliff moved to Kingston in 1962. After he released two singles that failed to make much of an impression, his career took off when his &quot;Hurricane Hattie&quot; became a hit, while he was aged just 14; it was produced by Leslie Kong, with whom Cliff would remain until Kong&#x27;s death. Later local hit singles included &quot;King of Kings&quot;, &quot;Dearest Beverley&quot; and &quot;Pride and Passion&quot;. In 1964, Cliff was chosen as one of the Jamaican representatives at the World&#x27;s Fair, and Cliff soon signed to Island Records and moved to Britain. Island initially (and unsuccessfully) tried to sell Cliff to the rock audience, but his career took off in the late 1960s. His international debut album was Hard Road to Travel, which received excellent reviews and included &quot;Waterfall&quot;, a Brazilian hit that won the International Song Festival. &quot;Waterfall&quot; was followed in 1969 by &quot;Wonderful World, Beautiful People&quot; and &quot;Vietnam&quot; in 1970, both popular throughout most of the world. Folk rock singer-songwriter Bob Dylan even called &quot;Vietnam&quot; the best protest song he&#x27;d ever heard. Wonderful World included a cover of Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Wild World&quot;, which was a success in 1970. Leslie Kong died of a heart attack in 1971. The soundtrack to the reggae film The Harder They Come was a huge success that sold well across the world, but did not break Cliff into the mainstream. After a series of albums, Cliff took a break and traveled to Africa, exploring his newfound Muslim spirituality. He quickly returned to music, touring for several years before he recorded with Kool &amp; the Gang for Power &amp; the Glory (1983). (During the 1981 River Tour, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band added Cliff&#x27;s little-known &quot;Trapped&quot; to their live set; it achieved great prominence when included on 1985&#x27;s We Are the World benefit album. ) The follow-up, Cliff Hanger (1985) won a Grammy Award, though it was his last major success in the U. S. until 1993. He continued to sell well in Jamaica and, to a lesser extent, the UK, returning to the mainstream pop charts in the U. S. and elsewhere with a version of Johnny Nash&#x27;s &quot;I Can See Clearly Now&quot; on the Cool Runnings film soundtrack in 1993 . In 2002, Cliff released his new album, Fantastic Plastic People in Europe, after first providing free downloads using Delacove&#x27;s People Music Media p2p software. This album featured collaborations with Joe Strummer, Annie Lennox, and Sting as well as new songs that were very reminiscent of Cliff&#x27;s original hits. In 2004 Cliff completely reworked the songs, dropping the traditional reggae in favor of an electronica sound, for inclusion in Black Magic. Cliff has also covered the famous African song &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot;. His recording of &#x27;You Can Get It If You Really Want&#x27; was used as a campaign anthem by the Sandinista National Liberation Front in the 1990 election in Nicaragua (they lost). It was also adopted by the British Conservative Party during their annual conference in October, 2007. It is unclear whether Mr Cliff endorsed either party. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame March 15,2010. ", "Iron Chic": "Iron Chic is a melodic punk band from Huntington Station, New York. The band features former Latterman members Phil Douglas and (until 2009) Brian Crozier as well as members of: Small Arms Dealer, Jonesin&#x27;, Get Bent and Capital. They have released a 5 song 2008 demo Tape/CDR, as well as the &quot;Shitty Rambo&quot; EP 7&quot; &amp; full-length LP, &quot;Not Like This&quot;, all on Long Island&#x27;s Dead Broke Rekerds. (CD version of &quot;Not Like This&quot; on 86&#x27;d Records &amp; Fanzine ) (Euro LP of &quot;Not Like This&quot; on Yo-Yo Records ) (Demo 2008 1-Sided 12&quot; EP on Yo-Yo Records- Ltd. to 300) Their releases can be downloaded for free / pay-what-you-want from their Bandcamp page", "TV on the Radio": "TV on the Radio are an American indie rock band formed in 2001 in Brooklyn, New York. The group has released several EPs including their debut Young Liars (2003), and five studio albums: Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes (2004), Return to Cookie Mountain (2006), Dear Science (2008), Nine Types of Light (2011), and Seeds (2014). For most of the band&#x27;s existence, the core TV on the Radio lineup has been Tunde Adebimpe (vocals/loops), David Andrew Sitek (guitars/keyboards/loops), Kyp Malone (vocals/guitars/bass/loops), Jaleel Bunton (drums/vocals/loops/guitars) and Gerard Smith (bass/keyboards) as official members. The band&#x27;s Bio from their website: TV on the Radio gets to do anything. Like a small platoon whose pleasing impenetrability is their core, the band consistently confounds expectations while managing to balance respect from critics and peers alike. The result is TV on the Radio gets to do anything they want. This freedom is their engine. \"It's about doing what feels right,\" says singer Tunde Adebimpe. \"I really feel like this band is something that is expansive and always changing and growing. If we wear our influences on our sleeve, it's a pretty crowded sleeve. \" It's no different with Seeds, the new and fifth proper studio album that Adebimpe has made along with Jaleel Bunton, Kyp Malone, and David Andrew Sitek (who also produced it). Having long outlasted that early 2000s fascination with all things Brooklyn to which the hip willfully succumbed, they continue to conquer music on their own terms. This album serves as another step in continuing to heed their reputation as \"the most vital, current band in America\" (Associated Press).  This go-round the songs are immediate and triumphant, textured with storytelling hooks and possibly the most honest music this band has ever composed. They've hit a point where they're OK being straight-up beautiful without having to manipulate prettiness into whatever unforeseen shape. Slate says Seeds has \"TV on the Radio's best songs in years. They are sounding sharper than ever. \" And the band knows it. Adebimpe has already said this is the band's best record. Not a boast, just an observation. \"I feel like I knew it before we were done,\" he says immediately. \"I was so excited by the songs while we were making them, I wanted to get more and more and more into it. The general feeling going into it was, &#x27;We&#x27;re still here. Our friendship with each other is so strong. Being in a band, at its best times, is like being&#8230; well, let's say whenever things are going really well, we&#x27;re like 'cool, Voltron&#x27;s back together. '\" The TV on the Radio guys are the type of people who go on hiatus and focus on music. They may take time between albums for their other endeavors, but they know when it's right to come together - especially when the music comes as easily and passionately as it did with case Seeds. The band found themselves collected in David Sitek's Los Angeles studio last year and recorded a couple of songs - \"Mercy\" and \"Million Miles\" and didn't want to stop. \"Those were just songs that we wrote because we hadn&#x27;t written songs together in a while,\" says Sitek \"They came out really fast and inspired us to do it again - and then 'again' turned into the record. \" Adebimpe and Sitek live in Los Angeles, Bunton and Malone reside in New York, but make no mistake: TV on the Radio is a quartet. To attempt to parse out exactly what each member does in the group would be to dismantle the fundamental essence of what makes TV on the Radio the monolithic anomaly they have been careful to cultivate and protect for more than a decade. They permeate beyond a wall of sound, and instead create a planetarium of music with every song. They embody many voices. Most of them can play just about anything. And sing too. They are equal partners in the creation of a type of noise that appeared seemingly out of nowhere over 10 years ago. Throughout the years, TV on the Radio has been consistent in the standard they set for themselves. Earlier records, Desperate Youth, Blood Thirsty Babes and Return To Cookie Mountain stole the hearts of fans and critics alike just the same, winning the Shortlist Music Prize and Spin&#x27;s Album of the Year respectively. Their breakout release Dear Science was named best album of 2008 by Rolling Stone, The Guardian, Spin Magazine, The New York Times, The Onion AV Club, MTV, even Entertainment Weekly. An embarrassment of riches, really. Their last album, 2011&#x27;s Nine Types of Light, was deemed &quot;pure heaven&quot; by the cherubs at Rolling Stone, and earned the band a Grammy(r) nomination. The band has also graced the stages of Saturday Night Live and The Colbert Report. \"The band is it's own 'self. ' It has to be that way,\" Adebimpe says. \"That&#x27;s been the goal for a long time. Nobody really wants to be the focal point for the band; the band should be the focal point. Not even the band: the music. We can show up and take credit for it, but ultimately it&#x27;s something that maybe we helped shape and facilitate coming into the world. But that's all. \" They happily recruit likeminded associates to help prop up this invention of theirs in the studio and on stage. (Kelis, for instance, appears on \"Lazzeray\"). The band has recorded and performed with other artists who've conquered the music world on their own terms just as much as they have. Fellow mavericks like Trent Reznor, Nick Zinner of Yeah Yeah Yeahs fame, Bauhaus singer Peter Murphy, Kazu Makino of Blonde Redhead, Martin Perna of Antibalas, Katrina Ford of Celebration, and David chuffing Bowie have all romped in the sandbox with TV on the Radio. \"If you share a material thing, it dissipates,\" Adebimpe says, recalling a fragment of philosophy he once heard, or might be improvising on the spot. \"If you share a spiritual thing, it just increases. It becomes more and more and more. I&#x27;m already thinking about the next record. \" Seeds is an expression of everything this band has been through in the last three years and more. They're influential, in their prime, they're TV on the Radio, and they've proven themselves to be one of the most important bands of this generation. It clicks, as it always does, and TV on the Radio is brand new again, again. \"No matter what you go through individually and collectively, when you step away from each other, you&#x27;re kind of like, &quot;I know that if we get together we can fire this thing,&quot; says Adebimpe. \"It&#x27;s definitely in the spirit of the punk rock we all grew up with. If you win, you&#x27;re still a punk. If you lose, you&#x27;re still a punk, and honestly, it&#x27;s not about anybody else. \" http://www. tvontheradio. com/", "Interpol": "Interpol is a post-punk band based in New York City, United States, that took an important part in the post-punk revival of the 2000s. The band consists of Paul Banks (vocals and guitar), Sam Fogarino (drums), and Daniel Kessler (guitar and backing vocals). The band&#x27;s sound is generally a mix of staccato bass and rhythmic, harmonized guitar, with a snare heavy mix, drawing comparisons to post-punk bands such as Joy Division and The Chameleons. The band formed in 1997 when Daniel Kessler met drummer Greg Drudy, previously a member of post-hardcore/screamo band Joshua Fit For Battle and Hot Cross, on the New York University campus. Kessler later added Carlos D. on the bass after meeting him in a history class. The line-up was complete after Kessler ran into Paul Banks, a friend whom he had met in Paris. In 2000, Sam Fogarino, whom the band knew through his job at a local record store, replaced Drudy. Carlos Dengler, who was responsible for bass and keyboards, left the band in 2010, and hasn&#x27;t been replaced, but announced various names to help them perform live. The band released Direction on the soundtrack of the television program &#x27;Six Feet Under&#x27; on June 28, 2005. Shortly thereafter they left Matador for a major label. Our Love to Admire was released on July 10, 2007 in the USA (July 9 in the UK) to generally favorable reviews. The Heinrich Maneuver was its first single. Their self-titled LP was released on September 7th 2010 and the tracks Barricade , Summer Well , Lights , and Try It On have been issued as singles. ", "Oneohtrix Point Never": "Oneohtrix Point Never is the recording name of composer/producer Daniel Lopatin. He is known for creating intricate electronic music that is characterized by its emphasis on melody and hypnotic pacing, conceptually stylized structures and extreme use of audio processing techniques. Early incarnations of OPN date back to the mid 2000s and drew heavily on the stylistic forms of cutout bin ambient and new age records, combined with the structure and abrasiveness of noise music. A series of home-recorded cassette and CDR releases interspersed with a number of full-length albums surfaced around 2007, and by 2009, these were compiled on the 5-LP box set 'Rifts' which brought him international acclaim. Lopatin then released his next LP Replica on his own imprint, Software. This body of work focused heavily on sample-based composition; intuitively structuring the record&#x27;s 10 tracks around samples from recorded archives of TV commercials he purchased from a &quot;nostalgia dealer&quot; on the internet. Nearly two years later, Oneohtrix Point Never made its Warp debut with R Plus Seven. Inspired by procedural poetry and commercial television soundtrack tropes, the record could be heard as a cryptic meditation on the materiality of sound itself told via Lopatin&#x27;s increasingly sculptural style of production. Other works have included collaborations with Antony Hegarty on a rendition of the Oneohtrix Point Never song &#x27;Returnal&#x27; and a remix of Hegarty&#x27;s 2012 song &#x27;Swanlights&#x27;, a remix of the Nine Inch Nails song &#x27;Find My Way&#x27;, and audio-visual works which have been hosted by The Tate and The Barbican and in London, The Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and MoMA PS1 in Long Island City. He is said to be writing his followup to R Plus Seven in 2015. ", "Marvin Gaye": "Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. (2 April 1939 - 1 April 1984) was an American soul and rnb singer, songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist, known as &quot;The Prince of Soul&quot;, or &quot;The Prince of Motown. &quot; Originally a member of the doo-wop group The Moonglows, he pursued a solo career after the group disbanded and released many successful solo hits including &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;. His best albums are still held in extremely high regard, and he is often cited as one of the finest singers of his era. Marvin Pentz Gay, Jr. was born in 1939 to Marvin Gay, Sr. and Alberta Gay in Washington, D. C. . Gaye began his career in Motown in 1958, and soon became Motown&#x27;s top solo male artist. He scored numerous hits during the 1960s, among them &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Peculiar&quot;, &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow&quot;, and &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;, as well as several hit duets with Tammi Terrell, including &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Mountain High Enough&quot;&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re All I Need to Get By&quot;, before moving on to his own form of musical self-expression. Along with Stevie Wonder, Gaye is notable for fighting the hit-making--but creatively restrictive--Motown record-making process, in which performers, songwriters and record producers were generally kept in separate camps. Gaye forced Motown to release his 1971 album What&#x27;s Going On , which is today hailed as one of the best albums of all time. Subsequent releases proved that Gaye, who had been a part-time songwriter for Motown artists during his early years with the label, could write and produce his own singles without having to rely on the Motown system. This achievement would pave the way for the successes of later self-sufficient singer-songwriter-producers in African American music, such as Luther Vandross and Babyface. During the 1970s, Gaye would release several other notable albums, including Let&#x27;s Get It On and I Want You, and released several successful singles such as &quot;Come Get to This&quot;, &quot;Got to Give It Up&quot; and &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;. By the time of his shooting death in 1984, at the hands of his clergyman father, Gaye had become one of the most influential artists of the soul music era. ", "Disclosure": "There is more than one artist with this name: 1) Disclosure are Guy and Howard Lawrence, two brothers from the UK making house/future music. After their debut single on Moshi-Moshi Records in september 2010, the duo released a 4 track EP on Transparent Records a year after. 2012 saw the release of &quot;Tenderly / Flow&quot; and The Face EP on Greco-Roman. Their first single for Universal Record&#x27;s PMR was called &quot;Latch&quot;. On February 1st 2013, they released &quot;White Noise&quot;, featuring vocals by Aluna Francis from AlunaGeorge. Their debut album &quot;Settle&quot; was released on June 3rd , preceded by the single &quot;You &amp; Me&quot; released on April 28th and premiered by Annie Mac on BBC Radio One on April 19th. http://disclosureofficial. com 2) On their previous tour, Disclosure arrived in Newport News, Va, 4 1/2 hours from home to learn that their show had been cancelled. Here, most bands would have called it a day, but instead they frantically called friends to search for shows via myspace. They ended up playing for free and headlining a show in Richmond, Va. This is just one of many stories that showcase Disclosure's dedication. In the past 3 years they have released 3 albums, have been part of an East Coast distributed compilation, performed in 7 states, went on 2 self-booked tours, and played over 50 shows. They have an upcoming full East Coast tour scheduled for July/August 2010 and they have no plans of slowing down. 3) Side project of Crunch Pod artist C/A/T. With the Disclosure project, Ben Arp of C/A/T shifts the focus towards tense samples and hard rhythmic sequences. While C/A/T has had a more abstract sound, Disclosure presents a more sonically straight-forward approach to songwriting. \"Full Disclosure\" attempts to further lift the veil and reveal the hidden hand that orchestrates world events. Extremely limited run of 25 copies and available only at Crunch Pod and was only available at live C/A/T performances in Summer 2005. CD-R version is out of print. This album was recently re-issued as a digital download direct from Crunch Pod. 4) An Alternative/Powerpop/Rock band from Faringdon, UK. Formed 5 years ago Disclosure have earnt their reputation as one of the most exciting bands to emerge from the Swindon area through relentless gigging, energetic shows and great sounds. Performing on stage with the likes of Young Guns and The Rileys, Disclosure have played at many of the biggest and most respected venues and festivals in and around Oxfordshire. Now signed with New Vision Records and having recently released their latest EP at the o2 academy2 Islington, Disclosure have never sounded so focussed and relevant and this year will be hitting venues around the UK. http://facebook. com/disclosuremusic", "Years   Years": "", "Antony and the Johnsons": "Antony and the Johnsons are a Mercury Prize-winning music act from New York City, New York, United States. The band is fronted by Antony (real name Antony Hegarty) who was born in 1971 and identifies as a transgender person. During the mid 90s Antony started solo; after originally producing songs with Blacklips Performance Cult and other late-night cabarets she had a number of songs to work with. In 1995 she assembled a backing group--the self-styled Antony and the Johnsons--and began to focus on the musical side of her performances. The group built up a cult following at hip New York clubs such as the Kitchen and Knitting Factory. Antony then received a NYFA for \"performance art/emergent forms\" which she used to record the Johnsons&#x27; debut album \"Blue Angel\", that remained unreleased until Current 93 leader David Tibet signed Antony and the Johnsons to his Durtro label. The cast list of musicians on the album, released under the title &quot;Antony and the Johnsons&quot; in 1998, included Baby Dee (harp), Francois Gehin (bass), Todd Cohen (drums), Charles Neilson (guitar), and a number of string and woodwind players. This album later were reissued in 2000 and in 2004 by Secretly Canadian. This collection of modern torch songs highlighted Antony&#x27;s soulful, multi-octave vocals and the Johnsons&#x27; graceful chamber pop arrangements, reaching a peak on &quot;Cripple And The Starfish&quot; and &quot;Divine&quot;, the latter a tribute to the late transvestite movie star. Further recordings by Antony and the Johnsons emerged in the early years of the new millennium, including &quot; I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy &quot; and a shared EP \"Live at St. Olave&#x27;s\" with Current 93, recorded live at Saint Olave&#x27;s Church in London, England. In early 2001 released 3 song EP &quot; I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy &quot;, included covers of Mysteries of Love (Appeared originally on the film Blue Velvet) and Soft Black Stars. Split EP included two new songs from the Johnsons, the first being You Stand Above Me , only one minute and thirty-six seconds long but containing all the melancholy and drama one would expect from the Johnsons. The other new track was The Lake which was an 1827 poem written by Edgar Allan Poe beautifully adapted to song. The Johnsons appear with Current 93 again on a 7\", with side B including the song Virgin Mary . This was limited to 500 copies, both released May 12th, 2003. By now the line-up of the Johnsons featured Todd Cohen, Jeff Langston (bass), Jason Hart (piano), Julia Kent (cello), Joan Wasser (violin), and Maxim Moston (violin). It was around this time that Lou Reed heard the \"I Fell in Love with a Dead Boy\" EP. Reed then recruited Antony for his album The Raven for guest vocals and took her on tour in 2003 which meant that Antony appeared on Lou's live album Animal Serenade . With the band now attracting wider attention, Antony and the Johnsons signed to US based label Secretly Canadian . Secretly Canadian then reissued the band&#x27;s debut to a wider audience in the USA. The Lake was released the following year through the new label. It's another 3 song EP including &quot;The Lake&quot; - Lou Reed appeared on Fistful of Love with guest vocals and guitar. The Horror Has Gone seems to be Antony expressing the end of a depressing phase in her life, a positive lyrical change from her debut style. In February 2005 Antony and the Johnsons released their second full length, I Am A Bird Now . It has guest appearances from Rufus Wainwright, Devendra Banhart, Lou Reed and Boy George. It went on to receive great critical acclaim in the UK and won Antony the Technics Mercury Music Prize for 2005. In 2006 Antony appeared in the Leonard Cohen tribute concert and subsequent film &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man. &quot; Her performance of &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot; is perhaps the highlight of the film. The 5-song Another World EP was released on October 7, 2008. As promised, it shows a mixture of continuation of earlier songs&#x27; atmosphere as well as more experimental work. Antony and the Johnsons&#x27; third album, &quot;The Crying Light&quot;, was released on January 19, 2009. This was followed by &quot;Swanlights&quot; in October, 2010. Both of these latter albums are less melodic and more experimental in nature the Antony&#x27;s earlier work and have met with critical acclaim yet little commercial success. http://www. antonyandthejohnsons. com/", "Gorillaz": "Gorillaz are a British virtual band formed in 1998 by Damon Albarn of Blur, and Jamie Hewlett, co-creator of the comic book Tank Girl. They had the idea to create the band while watching MTV in their London flat and originally intended to call the project Gorilla . The band consists of four fictional band members: 2-D (vocals, keyboard), Murdoc Niccals (bass), Noodle (guitar, vocals), and Russel Hobbs (drums). These characters only appear in animated form and are not alter-egos of real people, as is often mistakenly assumed. There is an extensive fictional back-story behind these band members, written by Albarn and Hewlett. Their albums, several of their music videos, and their autobiographical book Rise Of The Ogre all tell the saga. Damon Albarn is the only permanent musical contributor to the band, which is also a collaboration between various musicians. Their style is broad with a large number of alternative influences including rock, hip-hop, and electronica. They have released four studio albums: Gorillaz (2001), Demon Days (2005), Plastic Beach (2010) and The Fall (Also in 2010). Additionally, they have put out two B-side collections, G-Sides (2001) and D-Sides (2007), and a reggae remix of the Gorillaz album entitled Laika Come Home (2002). The band has also released three DVDs: Phase One: Celebrity Takedown , Demon Days: Live at Manchester Opera House , and Phase Two: Slow Boat To Hades . At the end of 2010, Gorillaz released their next album, The Fall, which was recorded during their US &#x27;Escape to Plastic Beach&#x27; tour. It is promoted as being the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website. The band&#x27;s first single, Clint Eastwood, was released on 5 March 2001. This single was the first of four from Gorillaz, which was released on 26 March 2001. The other three singles were released over the next year. These were: 19-2000, Rock the House, and Tomorrow Comes Today. The album sold over 7 million copies worldwide and has gone platinum twice in the United Kingdom earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of Records as the Most Successful Virtual Band. It was nominated for the Mercury Prize, but the nomination was later withdrawn at the band&#x27;s request. Collaborators on the first album included Del tha Funkee Homosapien (often mistaken as a band-member), Miho Hatori (formerly of Cibo Matto), Tina Weymouth of Talking Heads. and Ibrahim Ferrer. The album was produced by Dan the Automator. At the end of 2001 the band released another single, 911, which was a collaboration between Gorillaz and rap artists D12, Eminem and Terry Hall. The single was from the soundtrack to the 2002 action comedy Bad Company . Their second studio album, Demon Days, was released on 11 May 2005 and included the hit singles Feel Good Inc. , DARE, Dirty Harry and Kids With Guns / El Manana. Demon Days went five times platinum in the UK, double platinum in the United States, and earned five Grammy award nominations for 2006 and won one of them (Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals). Collaborators on this album (produced by Dj Danger Mouse) include De La Soul, Bootie Brown of The Pharcyde, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Neneh Cherry, Ike Turner, MF Doom, and Roots Manuva, amongst others. In late 2007, Albarn and Hewlett began working on Carousel, a new Gorillaz project which eventually evolved into the band&#x27;s third studio album, Plastic Beach, which was released 9 March 2010. Albarn said, &quot;I&#x27;m making this one the most pop record I&#x27;ve ever made in many ways, but with all my experience to try and at least present something that has got depth. \" The album features guest performances by Snoop Dogg, Lou Reed, Mos Def, Bobby Womack, Gruff Rhys, Mark E. Smith, Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Kano, Bashy, De La Soul, Little Dragon, Hypnotic Brass Ensemble, sinfonia ViVA, and The Lebanese National Orchestra for Oriental Arabic Music. A 3D projection of the group was shown at the 2005 MTV Music Awards and the 2006 Grammys. They also performed at the Brits, in a different format, using screens rather than projections. Gorillaz have performed live in other occasions as well: in 2001 &amp; 2002 they did tours where the musicians played behind screens, and in 2005 &amp; 2006, Gorillaz had five nights in Manchester and New York respectively. This time the screens were behind the musicians, who were visible to the audience only as silhouettes (except for the guest-stars). Since the band began to achieve mainstream success, there have been rumours of them working on a full-length movie. Some of these have been confirmed, but nothing has gotten beyond planning stages, mainly due to conflicts between the band and studios involved. In 2008, Hewlett said &quot;Ultimately we didn&#x27;t think that feel we&#x27;re in a position to make the kind of movie we want to make with Gorillaz at the moment. But I&#x27;d still like to make a full, lavishly-animated Gorillaz movie someday. &quot; Albarn and Hewlett created a Pop Opera called Monkey: Journey to the West , which premiered in the summer of 2007 at the Manchester International Festival. A soundtrack album was recorded in the summer as well (initially only digitally available though a CD version was released in 2008). The production went on to show at the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris in September-October 2007, the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, SC, USA in May 2008, and the Royal Opera House in London in July 2008. The duo behind the Pop Opera built on ideas from Monkey: Journey to the West to release a short film in the Summer of 2008 which accompanied the United Kingdom&#x27;s coverage of the BBC Olympic Coverage in Beijing. It featured a basic outline of the main plot elements of the Opera, reworked into a &quot;Journey to the East&quot;, with the characters finishing in the Beijing Olympic Stadium. Gorillaz headlined the Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury 2010, as an immediate replacement for U2, who dropped out of performing at the festival. At the end of 2010 Gorillaz released their next album The Fall made in the hotel rooms during their US tour. It is the first album made entirely on iPad. The album is streamed on the Gorillaz website and was available for free download for a limited time. In April 2012, Albarn told The Guardian that he and Hewlett had fallen out and that future Gorillaz projects were &quot;unlikely&quot;. Gorillaz&#x27;s current live band&#x27;s lineup includes Damon Albarn - Vocals, keyboards, guitar, bass guitar Jamie Hewlett - Illustration, visuals, FX Mike Smith Mick Jones - guitar Paul Simonon - bass Cass Browne - Drums, percussion", "Bring Me the Horizon": "Bring Me the Horizon are a British metalcore band from Sheffield, Yorkshire, who formed in 2004.

", "Hans Zimmer": "Hans Florian Zimmer (born September 12, 1957) is a German film composer and music producer, born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany and active since 1977. Having won a wide variety of honors and commendations, he has composed music for over 100 films, including award-winning films and box-office hits such as Rain Man (1988), Driving Miss Daisy (1989), Thelma &amp; Louise (1991), The Lion King (1994), Crimson Tide (1995), Gladiator (2000), The Last Samurai (2003), The Dark Knight (2008), Inception (2010), 12 Years a Slave (2013) and Interstellar (2014). A recipient of a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Zimmer spent the early part of his career in the United Kingdom before moving to the United States. He&#x27;s also the head of the film music division at DreamWorks studios and additionally works with other composers through the company that he founded: Remote Control Productions. Zimmer&#x27;s works are notable for integrating electronic music sounds with traditional orchestral arrangements. He has received four Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, a Classical BRIT Award, and an Academy Award. He was also named on the list of Top 100 Living Geniuses published by The Daily Telegraph . Zimmer was born in Frankfurt am Main, Germany on 12th September 1957, and moved to London as a teenager. While he lived in London, Zimmer wrote advertising jingles for Air-Edel Associates. Zimmer began his musical career playing keyboards and synthesisers. In 1980 he worked with The Buggles, a New Wave band formed in 1977 with Trevor Horn, Geoff Downs, and Bruce Woolley. Zimmer can be briefly seen in The Buggles music video for &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star&quot; (1979). In the 1980s, Zimmer worked with film composer Stanley Myers, a prolific film composer who composed scores for over sixty films. Zimmer and Myers co-founded the London-based Lillie Yard recording studio. Together, Myers and Zimmer worked on fusing the traditional orchestral sound with state-of-the-art electronics. Some of their first movies with this new sound include &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1982), &quot;Success is the Best Revenge&quot; (1984), &quot;Insignificance&quot; (1985), and &quot;My Beautiful Launderette&quot; (1985). In 1986, Zimmer joined David Byrne and Ryuichi Sakamoto on their Oscar-winning score for &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1988). Soon afterwards, Zimmer began working on his own solo projects. During his solo career years, Zimmer experimented and combined the use of old and new musical technologies. His first solo score was for Chris Menges's film &quot;A World Apart&quot; (1988). However, the turning point in his career came later that year when he was asked to compose a score for Barry Levinson's film &quot;Rain Man&quot; (1988). In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers mixed with steel drums. The score was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989. A year later Zimmer was asked to compose a score for Bruce Beresford&#x27;s &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; (1989), which won a Grammy Award 1991. In 1994, Zimmer won his biggest commercial hit for Disney's &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). He wanted to go to South Africa himself to record the soundtrack, but couldn&#x27;t because he had a police record there for making subversive films. &quot;The Lion King&quot; soundtrack won numerous awards, including an Oscar, a Golden Globe, and two Grammys. It was then adapted for the Broadway musical version, which won the Tony for Best Musical in 1998. Since the success of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Zimmer has written numerous film scores. His hundredth composition was for &quot;The Last Samurai&quot; (2003), for which he won both a Golden Globe and a Broadcast Film Critics nomination in 2004. After composing over a hundred film scores, Zimmer finally performed live for the first time in concert with a hundred-piece orchestra and a hundred-person choir at the twenty-seventh Annual Flanders International Film Festival. He has received numerous honours and awards, including: Prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award in Film Composition from the National Board of Review, Frederick Loewe Award in 2003 at the Palm Springs International Film Festival, ASCAP's Henry Mancini Award for Lifetime Achievement, and BMI&#x27;s prestigious Richard Kirk Award for lifetime achievement in 1996.

M. released its first single, &quot; Radio Free Europe &quot;, in 1981 on the independent record label Hib-Tone . The single was followed by the Chronic Town EP in 1982, the band&#x27;s first release on I. R. S. Records. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, Murmur , and built its reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring, and the support of college radio. Following years of underground success, R. E. M. achieved a mainstream hit in 1987 with the single &quot;The One I Love &quot;. The group signed to Warner Bros. in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide. By the early 1990s, when alternative rock began to experience broad mainstream success, R. E. M. was viewed as a pioneer of the genre and released its two most commercially successful albums, Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992), which veered from the band&#x27;s established sound. R. E. M. &#x27;s 1994 release, Monster , was a return to a more rock-oriented sound. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three band members. In 1996, R. E. M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80 million, at the time the most expensive recording contract in history. The following year, Bill Berry left the band, while Buck, Mills, and Stipe continued the group as a three-piece.

Also on the 27th of January 2012 he played a 20 minute set as part of a show organised by Pete Tong to showcase up and coming stars in Electronic music. He included some of his own songs such as Pop Culture and Icarus, as well as merging songs together; These ranged from Shuriken alongside Que Veux Tu and DJ, to M83&#x27;s Midnight City being played on top of a Madeon edit of Blitz by Digitalism. Leclercq has cited The Beatles and Daft Punk as his greatest musical influences. He is also known to use Novation&#x27;s Launchpad for his live performances, and FL Studio as his music production program of choice. A debut EP was scheduled to be released in 2012, but then cancelled in favour of multiple singles, the first of which - Icarus - is planned to be released in February 2012. Mid 2012 Madeon teamed up with one of EDM's favorite voices, Ellie Goulding, to produce Stay Awake. The track was meant for Ellie's Halcyon album, but wasn't delivered in time. It made a standalone release in March 2013.

Courtney puts a lot of effort into sounding effortless. Her songs are wild and wooly and wordy, her lyrics plainspoken and delivered like she's making them up on the spot. Court's debut album, Sometimes I Sit and Think, and Sometimes I Just Sit (2015), is out now! And can be ordered here on official site: www. courtneybarnett. com. au . Barnett was originally a part of several bands, including Immigrant Union and The Olivettes before focusing on her solo work. In 2012, Courtney started her own record label, Milk! Records, and recorded her debut EP I&#x27;ve Got A Friend Called Emily Ferris in a friend&#x27;s lounge room and released it later that year. Late 2012 also saw the release of a new single, &quot;History Eraser,&quot; which was backed with Jen Cloher&#x27;s &quot;Mount Beauty&quot; for a split seven-inch release. In 2013, Barnett released her second EP, How to Carve a Carrot Into a Rose. Along with &quot;History Eraser,&quot; the EP spawned a second single, &quot;Avant Gardener. &quot; Her second EP received international acclaim, taking her and the band, Dave Mudie (drums), Bones Sloane (bass) and Dan Luscombe (guitar) all around the world. Barnett would later combine those two EP releases into one for The Double EP: A Sea of Split Peas, which was released internationally on 20 May 2013 via House Anxiety/Marathon Artists. It was named the album of the week by Stereogum. ", "Karol Conka": "Karoline dos Santos Oliveira (born 1987), better known by her stage name Karol Conka, is a Brazilian rapper and singer-songwriter. ", "The Police": "The Police were an English rock band strongly influenced by reggae, jazz and punk rock. They were originally formed in 1977 in London by Stewart Copeland (drums), Gordon Sumner, better known as Sting (bass and lead vocals), and Henry Padovani (guitar). Andy Summers later joined the group, and after a very short stint as a quartet, Padovani left the band. The Police became one of the most popular bands in the late 70s and throughout the 80s. The Police are notable as one of the first mainstream white pop groups to adopt reggae as a predominant musical form and to score major international hits with reggae-styled material. Although reggae was already very popular in the United Kingdom (due to the large number of Caribbean immigrants) the style was little known in the United States or other countries, and prior to the emergence of the Police only a handful of reggae songs had enjoyed any significant chart success. Tension grew between the band members, because unlike most other bands, they did not share songwriting credits. They released their last album, Synchronicity, in 1983, selling over 8 million copies. Synchronicity is critically regarded as their best album, with hits such as Synchronicity II, King of Pain, and probably their best known song, Every Breath You Take. In 1984, after touring in support of Synchronicity, The Police went on hiatus while Sting pursued his acting and solo music careers. Two years later, The Police reformed and played a few concerts for Amnesty International. Soon after the band went into the studio. Sting wanted to re-record their old songs but Andy and Stewart wanted to leave the originals alone and only two songs were re-recorded during these studio sessions. Although the group is considered to have disbanded in 1984, 1986 was the last time The Police engaged in any musical activity. In 1992 the band released &quot;Message in a Box&quot;, their 4 CD box set, and performed at Sting&#x27;s wedding to Trudie Styler. A live CD was released in June 1995. On March 10, 2003 The Police were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and performed Message in a Bottle, Roxanne and Every Breath You Take. The Police reformed in 2007 and opened the Grammy award ceremony of that year with a performance of Roxanne. Towards the end of May the band began a world tour. In 2008 the tour ended at Madison Square Garden, New York on August 7, and The Police disbanded for good. Sting was quoted towards the end of the tour that he had achieved closure with the band and revealed that The Police would never tour or record again. ", "Dr. Feelgood": "Dr. Feelgood are a British pub rock band, formed in 1971. The classic line-up included Lee Brilleaux (b. 1953, d. 7 April 1994; vocals/harmonica), Wilko Johnson (b. John Wilkinson, 1947; guitar), John B. Sparks (b. 1953; bass) and John &#x27;The Big Figure&#x27; Martin (drums). Initially based in Canvey Island, Essex, on the Thames estuary, Dr. Feelgood broke into the London circuit in 1974. Brilleaux&#x27;s menacing personality complemented Johnson&#x27;s propulsive, jerky stage manner, while the guitarist&#x27;s staccato style dominated the group&#x27;s idiosyncratic brand of angular rhythm and blues. Their debut album, Down By The Jetty, was released in 1974, but despite critical approbation, it was not until the following year that the quartet secured due commercial success with Stupidity. Recorded live in concert, this raw, compulsive set topped the UK charts and the group&#x27;s status seemed assured. However, internal friction led to Johnson&#x27;s departure during sessions for a projected fourth album and although his replacement, John &#x27;Gypie&#x27; Mayo, was an accomplished guitarist, he lacked the striking visual image of his predecessor. Dr. Feelgood then embarked on a more mainstream direction which was only intermittently successful. &#x27;Milk And Alcohol&#x27; (1978) gave them their sole UK Top 10 hit. After the punk explosion their raw, jerky sound and clean-cut image provided inspiration to the post-punk generation (John Lydon being a big fan). Mayo left the band in 1981. Despite this, and various subsequent line-up changes, Dr. Feelgood continued touring and recording, although the band then suffered an almost career-finishing blow, when their frontman, Brilleaux, died of cancer on 7 April 1994. But, as Brilleaux had insisted prior to his demise, Dr. Feelgood reunited, initially with vocalist Pete Gage, and recommenced touring in 1996. Gage was replaced by Robert Kane who, celebrated his 1000th gig as the frontman of Dr. Feelgood in April 2007. ", "Coldplay": "Coldplay is a British alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom in 1997. The band comprises vocalist and pianist Chris Martin, lead guitarist Jonny Buckland - who met each other in September 1996 at Ramsay Hall (halls of residence) at University College London - bassist Guy Berryman and drummer Will Champion. With five successful albums releases (all of which debuted at #1 on the UK album chart) - and a sixth studio album released in May 2014 (Ghost Stories) - Coldplay have also achieved great success with their singles, such as Yellow, Speed of Sound, the Grammy-winning Clocks and the US and UK #1 single Viva La Vida. Influences Coldplay&#x27;s early material was often compared to that of Jeff Buckley and Radiohead, while also drawing comparisons to U2 and Travis. Since the release of the band&#x27;s debut album, Parachutes (2000), Coldplay has also drawn influence from other sources, including Echo and the Bunnymen and George Harrison on A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) and Johnny Cash and Kraftwerk for X&amp;Y (2005). Frontman Chris Martin credits 1980s Norwegian pop band a-ha for inspiring him to form his own band. Coldplay never intended to become England&#x27;s favorite rock &amp; roll sons when their signature rock melodies ruled the charts throughout 2000. The quartet yearned to mess around a bit, plucking their own acoustics for fun while attending the University College of London. All had been playing instruments since their early teens and had been influenced by the likes of Bob Dylan, the Stone Roses, Neil Young, and My Bloody Valentine. They never imagined taking reign of the UK&#x27;s ever-changing rock scene. Each member had come from a solid household of middle-class parents who encouraged music. Chris Martin, the eldest of five siblings, began playing the piano as a young child. He started playing in bands around age 15 and sought solace in the words of Tom Waits. Jonny Buckland, on the other hand, was into the heavy guitar work of Eric Clapton and Jimi Hendrix and was playing guitar by age 11. Scotland native Guy Berryman was into funk instead of indie rock, therefore leaving him to play bass. The multi-instrumentalist Champion had not planned to be a drummer until he joined Coldplay. He favored playing guitar, bass, and the tin whistle, but caught on to playing percussion when the band became official. When they burst onto the scene, Coldplay were heart-wrenching like Travis, passionate like Jeff Buckley, and as fresh as Oasis. They played their first gig at a festival for unsigned bands in Manchester, and the Safety EP was issued shortly thereafter. The Brothers &amp; Sisters EP was issued by Fierce Panda and released a year later. (Both releases saw only 500 pressings. ) Their sweet melodies and swooning lyrics landed Coldplay a UK deal with Parlophone in April 1999, and the five-track limited edition Blue Room EP followed that autumn. With nods from the media, the dream pop foursome was hailed as the next Travis, thanks to their simplistic acoustics and charming personas. Two more EPs, Shiver and Yellow , arrived in Spring 2000. Albums The band has released 5 albums with the latest sixth album scheduled for release in May 2014: Parachutes (2000), A Rush Of Blood To The Head (2002), X&amp;Y (2005), Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008), Mylo Xyoto (2011) and in May 2014, Ghost Stories (2014). Parachutes (2000) Their full-length debut album, Parachutes , earned the band a Mercury Music Prize nomination in the UK. It saw a US release in November 2000, and a month later Yellow, was chosen as the theme song for all promo spots for the American TV network ABC. The well-received hype surrounding Coldplay continued throughout 2001 as well; they were nominated for three Brit Awards and embarked on a sold-out ten-date tour of the US. Rumors of a split consumed most of the US tour. Martin frequently battled nasty colds and voice exhaustion, which led Coldplay to cancel a series of American dates and scrap a European tour. With all gossip aside, Coldplay resumed playing in Summer 2001 and earned additional success with second single Trouble. A Rush of Blood to the Head (2002) By the autumn, they had headed into the studio for a second album. Rumour had it that it might be Coldplay&#x27;s last album, since the band members felt they might not capture such brilliance again. A Rush Of Blood To The Head was released in August 2002. The CD/DVD package Live 2003 was issued a year later. Capturing the band&#x27;s show at the Horden Pavilion in Sydney, Australia, it highlighted Coldplay&#x27;s monumental success worldwide with A Rush Of Blood To The Head . Martin specifically earned a higher notch on the celebrity scale by marrying actress Gwyneth Paltrow in December 2003. Paltrow gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first daughter, Apple Blythe Alison Martin, the following April. X&amp;Y (2005) Fatherhood did not stop Martin from working, as Coldplay began recording material for a third album within weeks. Previously recorded material with long-time producer Ken Nelson was scrapped early on, while producer Danton Supple (Morrissey, The Cure) joined Coldplay to complete the recording of X&amp;Y . Speed Of Sound marked Coldplay&#x27;s first single from their long-awaited third effort in Spring 2005; the album followed in June, topping the charts around the world, including America and Britain. Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends (2008) Coldplay&#x27;s fourth album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released on June 12, 2008 in the United Kingdom, with the first single Violet Hill having been previously released as a free download through their official website for a week from April 29, 2008. Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was produced by Brian Eno, mixed by Markus Dravs, and drew influence from the time the group spent in South America. The album received lots of positive feedback for its originality in melodic acoustics and slightly less &#x27;synth-dependent&#x27; riffs. It offered a great insight into how significantly the band&#x27;s music had adapted and developed to themselves and the public. Charity duet (single) for World AIDS Day (2008) Barely a week before the album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends was released, a duet with Kylie Minogue, which was intended to be used on the album, was scrapped with the comment that &#x27;it's just too sexy also we haven't quite finished it&#x27; . The track, Lhuna was subsequently released as a charity single to promote World AIDS Day 2008 on December 1, 2008. Mylo Xyloto (2011) Coldplay&#x27;s fifth album, Mylo Xyloto , was released on October 24, 2011, with the first two tracks from the album - Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall and Paradise - were released on June 3, 2011 and September 12, 2012 respectively. The album was no. 1 in over 34 countries, and has sold over 8m copies worldwide. Ghost Stories (2014) The band&#x27;s sixth album, Ghost Stories , was officially released on May 19, 2014. Prior to the release, Coldplay made the full album available to stream via iTunes, with an animation of the album artwork designed by Mila Furstova, one week ahead of the official release date. The first track from the album, Midnight was released on February 25, 2014. The album was recorded at The Bakery and The Beehive studios in London, England. Ghost Stories entered the Billboard 200 as Number 1 and marked Coldplay&#x27;s fourth straight number 1 studio album, selling 383,000 copies in the US in the week ending May 25, 2014 - of which 64% came from digital downloads according to Billboard. Commercial endorsements Coldplay are one of very few current British music acts to achieve major success in North America. Despite their large worldwide popularity, the band has remained protective of how their music is used in the media, refusing its use for product endorsements. In the past, Coldplay had turned down multi-million dollar contracts from Gatorade, Diet Coke, and Gap, who wanted to use the songs Yellow, Trouble, and Don&#x27;t Panic respectively. According to Martin, &quot;We wouldn&#x27;t be able to live with ourselves if we sold the songs&#x27; meanings like that. &quot; On the other hand, Yellow has been used to back TV trailers for &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and Viva La Vida featured on an iTunes TV advert. Political and social activism Since 2002, Coldplay have been active supporters of various social and political causes. They have been visible advocates of Oxfam&#x27;s Make Trade Fair campaign and Amnesty International. The group has also performed at various charity projects such as Band Aid 20, Live 8, and the Teenage Cancer Trust.

Swift is a 7-time Grammy winner with a total of 22 nominations (April 2015). In 2006, she released her debut single &quot;Tim McGraw&quot;, then her self-titled debut album , which was subsequently certified multi-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In November 2008, Swift released her second album, Fearless , which featured a number of more pop oriented songs such as &quot;You Belong With Me&quot; and &quot;Love Story&quot;. Fearless was the best-selling album in 2009 in the USA and was awarded with 4 Grammy&#x27;s. Swift&#x27;s third and fourth albums, 2010&#x27;s &quot;Speak Now&quot; and 2012&#x27;s &quot;Red&quot;, both sold over one million copies within the first week of their US release. \"Speak Now\" won two Grammy Awards, while \"Red's\" singles &quot; We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together &quot; and &quot; I Knew You Were Trouble&quot; were worldwide hits. The 1989 was released on October 27, 2014. It marked a move away from her earlier country sounds and fully into pop. Both the title (&quot;1989&quot;) and the overall sound of the album - synth pop - were a nod to her birth year and nostalgia with the 1980s. It became the best-selling album of 2014, selling 3. 66m copies in USA, and as of April 2015, it had sold 4. 5m copies in the US (9m worldwide).

", "Amy Winehouse": "Amy Jade Winehouse (born 14 September 1983 in Southgate, London, died 23 July 2011 in Camden, London) was an English singer and composer, known for her eclectic mix of various musical genres including soul, jazz, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and Rhythm and Blues. Her musical formation went through listening to such jazz divas as Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan; she was later influenced by contemporary metropolitan popular music as well. She represented a union of these aesthetics: a happy fusion of &#x27;40s jazz, &#x27;60s soul and hard texts inspired by daily life. Winehouse&#x27;s 2003 debut album Frank did well - both commercially and critically - in her native Britain and was nominated for the prestigious Mercury Prize. Her 2006 follow-up album Back to Black led to six Grammy Award nominations and five wins, tying the record for one of the most wins by a female artist in a single night, and made Winehouse the first singer from the United Kingdom to win five Grammys. On February 14, 2007, she won a BRIT Award for Best British Female Artist; she had also been nominated for Best British Album. She has won the Ivor Novello Award three times, once in 2004 for Best Contemporary Song (musically and lyrically) for &quot;Stronger Than Me&quot;, once in 2007 for Best Contemporary Song for &quot;Rehab&quot;, and once in 2008 for Best Song Musically and Lyrically for &quot;Love Is a Losing Game&quot;. Winehouse received significant media attention for aspects of her life other than her singing. Her distinctive style, most notably her signature beehive hairstyle, has spawned imitators and been the muse for fashion designers such as Karl Lagerfeld. Her drug and alcohol addiction, as well as her self-destructive behaviour, have become regular tabloid fodder since 2007. She was found dead at her Camden flat on 23 July, 2011. She was 27 at the time of her death. ", "Black Eyed Peas": "Black Eyed Peas are an American hip hop/pop group formed in Los Angeles in 1995. The group currently line-up is formed by will. i. am, Taboo, Fergie and apl. de. ap. Black Eyed Peas have so-far sold an estimated 56 million albums and singles worldwide. Black Eyed Peas went to centenary state high school and got their start in 1988 when will. i. am (born 1975 William James Adams Jr. ) and apl. de. ap (born 1974 Allan Pineda) began rapping and performing together around Los Angeles. The pair signed to Ruthless Records (run by Eazy-E) after catching the attention of the nephew of Jerry Heller (Eazy-E&#x27;s manager). Along with Mookie Mook (Burning Star), Dante Santiago &amp; DJ Motiv8, they called their group A. T. B. A. N. Klann. Their debut album, &#x27;Grass Roots&#x27;, was not released originally because Ruthless did not consider the social themes reflected in the group&#x27;s music to be marketable to their audience. A single &quot;Puddles of H2O&quot; was released in 1994 but no album was released (until it leaked onto the Internet in the mid 2000s). After Eazy-E died of an AIDS related illness in 1995, they changed their name to Black Eyed Peas; will. i. am explained on the front cover of the Monkey Business album that &quot;Black Eyed Peas are food for the soul&quot;, hence the name. will. i. am has cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence and said he named his band after a food, like them.

In 1996, they produced and appeared on a song entitled &quot;That&#x27;s Right&quot; for Brian Austin Green&#x27;s hip-hop album One Stop Carnival. Later, they began using Kim Hill as a steady background singer. Unlike many hip-hop acts, they chose to perform with a live band and adopted a musical and clothing style that differed wildly from the &quot;gangsta rap&quot; sounds of other Los Angeles-based hip-hop acts at the time. Through the mid-&#x27;90s, they performed in the local club circuit alongside fellow acts such as Ozomatli and Jurassic 5. The group were signed to Interscope Records and released their debut, &quot;Behind the Front&quot; , in 1998.

The band&#x27;s lineup has no permanent drummer or keyboardist. Phoenix formed in 1999 and started off as the backing band for a remix of Air's \"Kelly Watch the Stars\" single. Soon after, Phoenix released their debut album United in 2000. The name &quot;Phoenix&quot; was officially chosen in 1996 when Laurent Brancowitz permanently joined Pheonix after his other band Darlin&#x27; disbanded.

Phoenix (2) A Romanian folk rock / rock band, who has experimented across the years with many musical genres, having a rich musical history that can easily be compared to that of the Beatles. Starting with the rock'n'roll of the Beat Generation, they continued enriching their sound with blues influences, jazz, psychedelic, krautrock, culminating with the orientation towards Romanian folk music, which they blended harmoniously with the sound that was popular in the '70s Phoenix is one of the most prominent Romanian Rock and Roll bands of the latest decades, and also the first one to take musical inspiration from ancient Romanian folk themes. Formed in the 1960s, it began by doing covers of Beatles songs. However, they soon had to change their style since the Romanian communist regime disliked any form of western culture. The communist regime suggested that all rock oriented bands should look for inspiration within the Romanian culture. These restrictions made the band's leader Nicolae Covaci search within the Romanian folklore, which gave them a unique sound. The beginning Phoenix was launched in the cosmopolitan city of Timisoara in 1962 by a pair of schoolboys: Nicu Covaci and Bela Kamocsa, under the name of Sfintii (The Saints). In their first years, together with Florin \"Moni\" Bordeianu (born 1948), they performed in school contests and at local clubs, covering Western music hits from The Rolling Stones, The Beatles, The Who, etc. , and they quickly became very popular amongst the youth. In 1965 the Communist authorities demanded that the band stop performing under the name The Saints, because of the religious innuendo that the name carried. Forced to comply, the band took the name Phoenix. Nicu Covaci also changed the composition of the band, around 1963, by adding Claudiu Rotaru, Ioan \"Pilu\" Stefanovici (born 1946) and Gunther \"Spitzly\" Reininger (born 1950) to the lineup. In 1965 they had their first big concert in Bucharest. Their performance brought a collaboration with Cornel Chiriac to record some of their songs. The first songs they recorded were \"Stiu ca ma iubesti si tu\" (\"I Know You Love Me Too\"), \"Dunare, Dunare\" (\"Danube, Danube\") and \"Bun e vinul ghiurghiuliu\" (\"Good is the Red Wine\"). The same year also marked the beginning of their collaboration with Victor Carcu, who went on to write many of their most famous songs, such as \"Vremuri\" (\"Old Times\"), \"Si totusi ca voi sunt\" (\"And Yet I Am Like You\"), \"Nebunul cu ochii inchisi\" (\"Crazy Man with closed eyes\"), \"Floarea stincilor\" (\"Mountain Flower\") and \"Canarul\" (\"Canary\"). In December 1967 Phoenix had their first major series of concerts in many western cities, capped off by two huge concerts in Timisoara. After winning a few prizes in national students' contests, held at Iasi the following year, in 1968 they recorded their first EP, Vremuri (Old Times), containing two original songs, Vremuri and Canarul (The Canary), and two covers (Lady Madonna - The Beatles and Friday on my Mind - Easybeats). A second EP would follow one year later, named Floarea stincilor (The Flower of the Rocks), with all four songs being original compositions. Both albums sport a sound reminiscent of the beat style popular in that era. They then started working on a rock theater play \"Omul 36/80\" (The Man 36/80) which won several prizes for originality. In 1969 Ioan \"Pilu\" Stefanovici was replaced by Dorel \"Baba\" Vintila Zaharia (born 1943). For the next year the band became more and more popular, frequently visiting Bucharest and being invited in talk shows about music. In 1970, Moni Bordeianu emigrated to the US, and, for a brief period of time the band suspended its activity, also due to total censorship that followed a protesting speech held by Bordeianu in his last concert. 1970 meant the blues period of the band. The formula used was Nicu Covaci - guitar, Gunther \"Spitzly\" Reininger - piano and voice, Zoltan Covacs - bass guitar and Liviu Butoi - oboe and flute. Phoenix was born again the next year, with Covaci, Josef Kappl, Mircea Baniciu, Costin Petrescu (replaced in 1974 by Ovidiu Lipan, nicknamed \"Tandarica\") and Valeriu Sepi. But the Communist officials were not very comfortable with the Western-style music that they were singing, and kept creating them problems. So Phoenix abandoned beat turned to Romanian folklore, pagan rituals, mystic animals and old traditions. In this same year, Phoenix started a collaboration with the Institute of Ethnography and Folklore and the Folklore section of Timisoara University on an ambitious project, a rock poem that combined traditional wooden instruments with modern sounds. During this project the band also started collaborating with Valeriu Sepi (born 1947), who eventually joined the band. The first outcome would be the 1972 LP Cei ce ne-au dat nume (Those Who Gave Us Our Names) - the first LP to be recorded in Romania by a Romanian band. Two years later, Mugur de fluier (Flute Bud) followed. Both albums underwent severe censorship. In 1973 Phoenix represented Romania at the \"Golden harp\" festival in Bratislava (Slovakia) and then in the \"Disc festival\" in Sopot (Poland). Also, they wanted to record a new rock-opera, named \"Mesterul Manole\", but the communist officials censored it all, by \"losing\" the unique book with costume sketches and lyrics given to them for official approval. The result was only a EP with an extract from the opera, Mesterul Manole, uvertura (Mesterul Manole, uverture) and two older songs, Mama, Mama (Mother, Mother) and Te intreb pe tine, soare. . . (I'm asking you, sun. . . ). On Monday, 19 November 1973, Phoenix held a memorable concert in Bucharest, presenting their new hits \"Andri Popa\", \"Pavel Chinezu\" and \"Strunga\", which composed the new disc \"Mugur de fluier\". The new songs were still influenced by folklore yet had a new style. This style was the result of the collaboration with new songwriters Andrei Ujica and Serban Foarta. Based on those new songs Nicu Covaci created a new show \"Introducere la un concert despre muzica veche la romani\" (\"Introduction to a concert about old Romanian music\") in which he introduced violins, flutes, archaic percussion and other traditional instruments. The show was never finished due to a new collaboration with \"Cenaclul Flacara. \" This period is considered the peak for Phoenix. Their sound was considered original and powerful and full stadiums were common for their concerts. Every winter the members of the band would retreat to Mount Semenic and plan their upcoming songs. That winter the show \"Zoosophia\", a title that would later change to \"Cantafabule\", was created. The show began by \"calling\" all mythic animals and continued by dedicating a song to each of them, finishing with the Phoenix, the band's symbol. The year 1975 brought a newcomer to the band, Ovidiu Lipan \"Tandarica\" (born 1953). The \"Cantafabule\" show was first presented in Timisoara in February 1975. The disc was recorded in a very short time and was published the same year with a misspelling in the title: \"Cantofabule. \" What followed were two years of almost continuous concerts but also the creation of the soundtrack for the movie \"Nemuritorii\". By this time, the popularity of Phoenix had grown huge; people loved their songs not only for what they were, but also because they contained thinly-veiled allusions to the Communist regime. The band members, especially Nicu Covaci, found themselves increasingly harassed by the Securitate. Covaci married a Dutch woman and left the country in 1976. He returned in 1977, bringing in relief aid for those struck by the powerful earthquake on March 4. After two grandiose concerts in Constanta and Tulcea, Covaci surprisingly left the country again, this time with all the band members (except Baniciu) hidden inside their Marshall speakers - a huge undertaking, since in Communist Romania it was extremely difficult to obtain approval to travel abroad, and illegal border crossing was punished with imprisonment. After arriving in Germany, Phoenix disbanded. Kappl and a few others (Erlend Krauser, Ovidiu Lipan) formed a new band, Madhouse and released a not very successful album named From The East. In 1981, Covaci co-opted Neumann and Lipan and English bassist Tom Buggie, who had an amazing technical playing ability, under the name Transsylvania Phoenix (since a band named Phoenix already existed) and released an LP named Transsylvania, containing two old Phoenix songs translated into English to target the Western audience and five new ones. Covaci together with Kappl also released two EPs and one maxi single as Transsylvania-Phoenix. In 1990 Phoenix made a triumphant comeback to Romania, with a highly emotional concert in their hometown Timisoara, the city that sparked the popular revolt in December 1989 that eventually led to the downfall of the Communist regime. In the following years, Phoenix toured a lot and released a few compilations of their older recordings. Internal frictions, especially between Covaci and Baniciu, were making headlines in the media. A new album appeared in 2000, the first original album after their 1990 comeback; with the exception of Covaci, the lineup comprised none of the members from the '70s. In 2002, the 40th Anniversary of the band brought together almost all former members in a supershow. At the end of 2005 the band (in its classic gold lineup) released a new album, named Baba Novak. As of 2010, the band still performs at live events. Phoenix (3) A short-lived British hard rock band that consisted of Jim Rodford, Robert Henrit, John Verity of Argent.

He studied composition and piano at Edinburgh University, the Royal Academy of Music and in Florence with Luciano Berio.  Though he has a strong background in the canons of classical music, his influences were more modern composers and in particular, Iannis Xenakis whose musical compositions applied mathematical and physical laws and Philip Glass whose sound was a major influence on Richter. His influences also include rock bands The Beatles, Pink Floyd and The Clash, as well as electronic music groups Kraftwerk and Autechre. After finishing his studies, he co-founded Piano Circus, a contemporary classical ensemble, where he stayed for ten years. With the ensemble, he commissioned and performed the works of experimental artists like Steve Reich, Arvo Part, Brian Eno and Julia Wolfe. Piano Circus&#x27;s performances incorporated found sounds and video, allowing Richter to integrate his love of sampling and electronics. After he left, he became involved in the UK&#x27;s thriving electronic scene, collaborating with The Future Sound of London and Roni Size. He has released four solo albums: Memoryhouse (2002), Blue Notebooks (2004), Songs from Before (2006), and latest, 24 Postcards in Full Colour (2008), a collection of miniatures meant to be used as ringtones. Recently he has scored the soundtrack to the critically acclaimed film Waltz with Bashir by Ari Folman as well as INFRA, Max&#x27;s new score for The Royal Ballet, made with choreographer Wayne Macgregor and fine artist Julian Opie. He has also produced the score for the short animated film Lost and Found based upon the children&#x27;s book by Oliver Jeffers. Recently, Richter&#x27;s score, &quot;On the Nature of Daylight&quot;, has been included in the acclaimed film Shutter Island. ", "Marina & the Diamonds": "Marina Lambrini Diamandis (Greek: Marina-Lamprine Diamante; born 10 October, 1985) is a Greek-Welsh singer, who performs under the stage name of Marina and the Diamonds , which is based on the English translation of her surname. (Questions about Last. fm redirecting &quot;Marina AND The Diamonds&quot; to &quot;Marina &amp; The Diamonds&quot;? Please, read here ) Marina was born on the 10th October 1985 in Abergavenny, Wales.

She released her first single (a double A-side, Obsessions/Mowgli&#x27;s Road ) through Neon Gold Records on the 14th February 2009, closely followed by The Crown Jewels EP in June 2009. Now signed to 679 Recordings, her first single with the label was &quot;Mowgli&#x27;s Road&quot;, released in November 2009. In January 2010 she reached number two on the BBC Sound of 2010 poll list. This was followed by the release of her debut full-length studio album, The Family Jewels on the 22nd February 2010, and her debut American release, The American Jewels EP on the 25th May 2010. Diamandis&#x27; musical style ranges from keyboard-based ballads to more up-tempo new wave-style songs with full band backing. She has cited a wide range of influences such as Daniel Johnston, Blondie, Patti Smith, Nirvana, PJ Harvey, Elliott Smith, Dolly Parton, Britney Spears and Madonna. * Official site", "Oasis": "There are multiple artists who have used the name Oasis: 1. Oasis were an English rock band that formed in Manchester in 1991. Originally known as The Rain, the group was formed by Liam Gallagher (vocals and tambourine), Paul Arthurs (guitar), Paul McGuigan (bass guitar) and Tony McCarroll (drums, percussion), who were soon joined by Liam&#x27;s older brother Noel Gallagher (lead guitar and vocals). Its members were signed to independent record label Creation Records and released their record-setting debut album Definitely Maybe in 1994, including hits like Live Forever and Supersonic. The following year, the band recorded the critically acclaimed (What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory? with their new drummer Alan White that led to international success propelled by singles Wonderwall, Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger and Champagne Supernova. In 1997, Oasis released third album and became the fastest-selling album in UK chart history, aside Michael Jackson&#x27;s Bad. McGuigan and Arthurs left the band as they went on to record and release Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and were replaced by Gem Archer and Andy Bell who joined the group for the recording of Heathen Chemistry. In August 2009, Noel Gallagher announced his departure from the band. Liam Gallagher initially stated that Oasis were &quot;done&quot;, but later in February 2010 announced that the remaining members of the band would continue to record music, and did not rule out the possibility of retaining the Oasis name. However, Liam and other former members of the band are instead continuing under the name Beady Eye and Noel has formed Noel Gallagher&#x27;s High Flying Birds. 2. American rock band: Oasis was an American rock band from Marin County, California active in the 1970s. Their sound has been described as psychedelic folk rock, progressive folk and psychedelic pop, characterized by male/female harmonies. With the help of David Crosby of famed Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, they recorded one album, Oasis, released on the Cranbus label in 1973. Members Shelly Fox was previously in Cookin Mama, and Stephen Barncard also worked with Chet Nichols and David Crosby. Kelly Bryan had earlier been in the short-lived Grootna, and later played on a couple of albums by Jesse Colin Young. Between 1971 and 1978 members of Oasis also recorded under the name RJ Fox and completed an album for Atlantic in 1971 which was never released. A double disc collection of Oasis and RJ Fox material was compiled by the Black Bamboo label in 1998. RJ Fox: Retrospective Dreams included the lost LP, tracks from the Oasis album and many others. 3. American deep house producers: Oasis is a collaboration between Omar-S (Alex O. Smith) and Shadow Ray from Detroit. 4. British classical group: Oasis was a short-lived English classic group active through 1984-1988 featuring Peter Skellern, Julian Lloyd Webber (later replaced by Audrey Riley), Mitch Dalton, Bill Lovelady and Mary Hopkin. Oasis released only self-titled album and two singles and toured till 1988. ", "Miles Davis": "Miles Davis ( Miles Dewey Davis III , Alton, Illinois, May 26, 1926 - Santa Monica, California, September 28, 1991) was an American trumpeter, bandleader and composer. Widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, Miles Davis was, with his musical groups, at the forefront of several major developments in jazz music, including bebop, cool jazz, hard bop, modal jazz, and jazz fusion. Many well-known musicians rose to prominence as members of Davis&#x27; ensembles, including saxophonists Gerry Mulligan, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, George Coleman, Wayne Shorter, Dave Liebman, Branford Marsalis and Kenny Garrett; trombonist J. J. Johnson; pianists Horace Silver, Red Garland, Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, and Keith Jarrett; guitarists John McLaughlin, John Scofield and Mike Stern; bassists Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Dave Holland, Marcus Miller and Darryl Jones, ; and drummers Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams, Billy Cobham, Jack DeJohnette, and Al Foster. Miles Davis was born on May 26, 1926, to a relatively affluent family in Alton, Illinois. His father, Dr. Miles Henry Davis, was a dentist. In 1927 the family moved to East St. Louis, Illinois. They also owned a substantial ranch in northern Arkansas, where Davis learned to ride horses as a boy. Davis&#x27; mother, Cleota Mae (Henry) Davis, wanted her son to learn the piano; she was a capable blues pianist but kept this fact hidden from her son. His musical studies began at 13, when his father gave him a trumpet and arranged lessons with local musician Elwood Buchanan. Davis later suggested that his father&#x27;s instrument choice was made largely to irk his wife, who disliked the trumpet&#x27;s sound. Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without vibrato; he was reported to have slapped Davis&#x27; knuckles every time he started using heavy vibrato. Davis would carry his clear signature tone throughout his career. He once remarked on its importance to him, saying, &quot;I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can't get that sound I can't play anything. &quot; Clark Terry was another important early influence. By age 16, Davis was a member of the music society and playing professionally when not at school. At 17, he spent a year playing in Eddie Randle&#x27;s band, the Blue Devils. During this time, Sonny Stitt tried to persuade him to join the Tiny Bradshaw band, then passing through town, but Davis&#x27; mother insisted that he finish his final year of high school. In 1944, the Billy Eckstine band visited East St. Louis. Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker were members of the band, and Davis was brought in on third trumpet for a couple of weeks because the regular player, Buddy Anderson, was out sick. Even after this experience, once Eckstine&#x27;s band left town, Davis&#x27; parents were still keen for him to continue formal academic studies. In the fall of 1944, following graduation from high school, Davis moved to New York City to study at the Juilliard School of Music. Upon arriving in New York, he spent most of his first weeks in town trying to get in contact with Charlie Parker, despite being advised against doing so by several people he met during his quest, including saxophonist Coleman Hawkins. Finally locating his idol, Davis became one of the cadre of musicians who held nightly jam sessions at two of Harlem&#x27;s nightclubs, Minton&#x27;s Playhouse and Monroe&#x27;s. The group included many of the future leaders of the bebop revolution: young players such as Fats Navarro, Freddie Webster, and J. J. Johnson. Established musicians including Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke were also regular participants. Davis dropped out of Juilliard, after asking permission from his father. In his autobiography, Davis criticized the Juilliard classes for centering too much on the classical European and &quot;white&quot; repertoire. However, he also acknowledged that Juilliard helped give him a grounding in music theory that would prove valuable in later years. Davis began playing professionally, performing in several 52nd Street clubs with Coleman Hawkins and Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis. In 1945, he entered a recording studio for the first time, as a member of Herbie Fields&#x27;s group. This was the first of many recordings to which Davis contributed in this period, mostly as a sideman. He finally got the chance to record as a leader in 1946, with an occasional group called the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway--one of the rare occasions when Davis, by then a member of the groundbreaking Charlie Parker Quintet, can be heard accompanying singers. In these early years, recording sessions where Davis was the leader were the exception rather than the rule; his next date as leader would not come until 1947. Around 1945, Dizzy Gillespie parted ways with Parker, and Davis was hired as Gillespie&#x27;s replacement in his quintet, which also featured Max Roach on drums, Al Haig (replaced later by Sir Charles Thompson and Duke Jordan) on piano, and Curley Russell (later replaced by Tommy Potter and Leonard Gaskin) on bass. With Parker&#x27;s quintet, Davis went into the studio several times, already showing hints of the style for which he would become known. On an oft-quoted take of Parker&#x27;s signature song, &quot;Now&#x27;s the Time&quot;, Davis takes a melodic solo, whose unbop-like quality anticipates the &quot;cool jazz&quot; period that would follow. The Parker quintet also toured widely. During a stop in Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that landed him in the Camarillo State Mental Hospital for several months, and Davis found himself stranded. He roomed and collaborated for some time with bassist Charles Mingus, before getting a job on Billy Eckstine&#x27;s California tour, which eventually brought him back to New York. In 1948, Parker returned to New York, and Davis rejoined his group. The relationships within the quintet, however, were growing tense. Parker&#x27;s erratic behavior (attributable to his well-known drug addiction) and artistic choices (both Davis and Roach objected to having Duke Jordan as a pianist and would have preferred Bud Powell) became sources of friction. In December 1948, disputes over money (Davis claims he was not being paid) began to strain their relationship even further. Davis finally left the group following a confrontation with Parker at the Royal Roost. For Davis, his departure from Parker&#x27;s group marked the beginning of a period in which he worked mainly as a freelancer and as a sideman in some of the most important combos on the New York jazz scene. In 1948 Davis grew close to the Canadian composer and arranger Gil Evans. Evans&#x27; house had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers (including Davis, Roach, pianist John Lewis, and baritone sax player Gerry Mulligan) unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumentalism that dominated the bebop scene of the time. Evans had been the arranger for the Claude Thornhill orchestra, and it was the sound of this group, as well as Duke Ellington&#x27;s example, that suggested the creation of an unusual line-up: a nonet including a French horn and a tuba (this accounts for the &quot;tuba band&quot; moniker that was to be associated with the combo). Davis took an active role in the project, so much so that it soon became &quot;his project&quot;. The objective was to achieve a sound similar to the human voice, through carefully arranged compositions and by emphasizing a relaxed, melodic approach to the improvisations. The nonet debuted in the summer of 1948, with a two-week engagement at the Royal Roost. The sign announcing the performance gave a surprising prominence to the role of the arrangers: &quot;Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan&quot;. It was, in fact, so unusual that Davis had to persuade the Roost&#x27;s manager, Ralph Watkins, to allow the sign to be worded in this way; he prevailed only with the help of Monte Kay, the club&#x27;s artistic director. The nonet was active until the end of 1949, along the way undergoing several changes in personnel: Roach and Davis were constantly featured, along with Mulligan, tuba player Bill Barber, and alto saxophonist Lee Konitz, who had been preferred to Sonny Stitt (whose playing was considered too bop-oriented). Over the months, John Lewis alternated with Al Haig on piano, Mike Zwerin with Kai Winding on trombone (Johnson was touring at the time), Junior Collins with Sandy Siegelstein and Gunther Schuller on French horn, and Al McKibbon with Joe Shulman on bass. Singer Kenny Hagood was added for one track during the recording sessions. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some African American jazz players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, but Davis rebuffed their criticisms. A contract with Capitol Records granted the nonet several recording sessions between January 1949 and April 1950. The material they recorded was released in 1956 on an album whose title, Birth of the Cool, gave its name to the &quot;cool jazz&quot; movement that developed at the same time and partly shared the musical direction begun by Davis&#x27; group. For his part, Davis was fully aware of the importance of the project, which he pursued to the point of turning down a job with Duke Ellington&#x27;s orchestra. The importance of the nonet experience would become clear to critics and the larger public only in later years, but, at least commercially, the nonet was not a success. The liner notes of the first recordings of the Davis Quintet for Columbia Records call it one of the most spectacular failures of the jazz club scene. This was bitterly noted by Davis, who claimed the invention of the cool style and resented the success that was later enjoyed--in large part because of the media&#x27;s attention--by white &quot;cool jazz&quot; musicians (Mulligan and Dave Brubeck in particular). This experience also marked the beginning of the lifelong friendship between Davis and Gil Evans, an alliance that would bear important results in the years to follow. The first half of the 1950s was, for Davis, a period of great personal difficulty. At the end of 1949, he went on tour in Paris with a group including Tadd Dameron, Kenny Clarke (who remained in Europe after the tour), and James Moody. Davis was fascinated by Paris and its cultural environment, where black jazz musicians, and African Americans in general, often felt better respected than they did in their homeland. While in Paris, Davis began a relationship with French actress and singer Juliette Greco. Many of his new and old friends (Davis, in his autobiography, mentions Clarke) tried to persuade him to stay in France, but Davis decided to return to New York. Back in the States, he began to feel deeply depressed. The depression was due in part to his separation from Greco, in part to his feeling underappreciated by the critics (who were hailing Davis&#x27; former collaborators as leaders of the cool jazz movement), and in part to the unraveling of his liaison with a former St. Louis schoolmate who was living with him in New York and with whom he had two children. These are the factors to which Davis traces a heroin habit that deeply affected him for the next four years. Though Davis denies it in his autobiography, it is also likely that the environment in which he was living played a role. Most of Davis&#x27; associates at the time, some of them perhaps in imitation of Charlie Parker, had drug addictions of their own (among them, sax players Sonny Rollins and Dexter Gordon, trumpeters Fats Navarro and Freddie Webster, and drummer Art Blakey). For the next four years, Davis supported his habit partly with his music and partly by living the life of a hustler. By 1953, his drug addiction was beginning to impair his ability to perform. Heroin had killed some of his friends (Navarro and Freddie Webster). He himself had been arrested for drug possession while on tour in Los Angeles, and his drug habit had been made public in a devastating interview that Cab Calloway gave to Down Beat. Realizing his precarious condition, Davis tried several times to end his drug addiction, finally succeeding in 1954 after returning to his father&#x27;s home in St. Louis for several months and literally locking himself in a room until he had gone through a painful withdrawal. During this period he avoided New York and played mostly in Detroit and other midwestern towns, where drugs were then harder to come by. Despite all the personal turmoil, the 1950-54 period was actually quite fruitful for Davis artistically. He made quite a number of recordings and had several collaborations with other important musicians. He got to know the music of Chicago pianist Ahmad Jamal, whose elegant approach and use of space influenced him deeply. He also definitively severed his stylistic ties with bebop. In 1951, Davis met Bob Weinstock, the owner of Prestige Records, and signed a contract with the label. Between 1951 and 1954, he released many records on Prestige, with several different combos. While the personnel of the recordings varied, the lineup often featured Sonny Rollins and Art Blakey. Davis was particularly fond of Rollins and tried several times, in the years that preceded his meeting with John Coltrane, to recruit him for a regular group. He never succeeded, however, mostly because Rollins was prone to make himself unavailable for months at a time. In spite of the casual occasions that generated these recordings, their quality is almost always quite high, and they document the evolution of Davis&#x27; style and sound. During this time he began using the Harmon mute, held close to the microphone, in a way that grew to be his signature, and his phrasing, especially in ballads, became spacious, melodic, and relaxed. This sound was to become so characteristic that the use of the Harmon mute by any jazz trumpet player since immediately conjures up Miles Davis. The most important Prestige recordings of this period (Dig, Blue Haze, Bags&#x27; Groove, Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants, and Walkin&#x27;) originated mostly from recording sessions in 1951 and 1954, after Davis&#x27; recovery from his addiction. Also of importance are his five Blue Note recordings, collected in the Miles Davis, Volume 1 album. With these recordings, Davis assumed a central position in what is known as hard bop. In contrast with bebop, hard bop used slower tempos and a less radical approach to harmony and melody, often adopting popular tunes and standards from the American songbook as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop also distanced itself from cool jazz by virtue of a harder beat and by its constant reference to the blues, both in its traditional form and in the form made popular by rhythm and blues. A few critics go as far as to call Walkin&#x27; the album that created hard bop, but the point is debatable, given the number of musicians who were working along similar lines at the same time (and of course many of them recorded or played with Davis). Also in this period Davis gained a reputation for being distant, cold, and withdrawn and for having a quick temper. Among the several factors that contributed to this reputation were his contempt for the critics and specialized press and some well-publicized confrontations with the public and with fellow musicians. (One occasion, in which he had a near fight with Thelonious Monk during the recording of Bags&#x27; Groove, received wide exposure in the specialized press. ) The &quot;nocturnal&quot; quality of Davis&#x27; playing and his somber reputation, along with his whispering voice, earned him the lasting moniker of &quot;prince of darkness&quot;, adding a patina of mystery to his public persona. Back in New York and in better health, in 1955 Davis attended the Newport Jazz Festival, where his performance (and especially his solo on &quot;&#x27;Round Midnight&quot;) was greatly admired and prompted the critics to hail the &quot;return of Miles Davis&quot;. At the same time, Davis recruited the players for a formation that became known as his &quot;first great quintet&quot;: John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Red Garland on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums. None of these musicians, with the exception of Davis, had received a great deal of exposure before that time; Chambers, in particular, was very young (19 at the time), a Detroit player who had been on the New York scene for only about a year, working with the bands of Bennie Green, Paul Quinichette, George Wallington, J. J. Johnson, and Kai Winding. Coltrane was little known at the time, in spite of earlier collaborations with Dizzy Gillespie, Earl Bostic, and Johnny Hodges. Davis hired Coltrane as a replacement for Sonny Rollins, after unsuccessfully trying to recruit Cannonball Adderley. The repertoire included many bebop mainstays, standards from the Great American Songbook and the pre-bop era, and some traditional tunes. The prevailing style of the group was a development of the Davis experience in the previous years--Davis playing long, legato, and essentially melodic lines, while Coltrane, who during these years emerged as a leading figure on the musical scene, contrasted by playing high-energy solos. With the new formation also came a new recording contract. In Newport, Davis had met Columbia Records producer George Avakian, who persuaded him to sign with his label. The quintet made its debut on record with the extremely well received &#x27;Round About Midnight. Before leaving Prestige, however, Davis had to fulfill his obligations during two days of recording sessions in 1956. Prestige released these recordings in the following years as four albums: Relaxin&#x27; with the Miles Davis Quintet, Steamin&#x27; with the Miles Davis Quintet, Workin&#x27; with the Miles Davis Quintet, and Cookin&#x27; with the Miles Davis Quintet. While the recording took place in a studio, each record of this series has the structure and feel of a live performance, with several first takes on each album. The records became almost instant classics and were instrumental in establishing Davis&#x27; quintet as one of the best on the jazz scene. The quintet was disbanded for the first time in 1957, following a series of personal problems that Davis blames on the drug addiction of the other musicians. Davis played some gigs at the Cafe Bohemia with a short-lived formation that included Sonny Rollins and drummer Art Taylor, and then traveled to France, where he recorded the score to Louis Malle&#x27;s film Ascenseur pour l&#x27;echafaud. With the aid of French session musicians Barney Wilen, Pierre Michelot, and Rene Urtreger, and American drummer Kenny Clarke, he recorded the entire soundtrack with an innovative procedure, without relying on written material: starting from sparse indication of the harmony and a general feel of a given piece, the group played by watching the movie on a screen in front of them and improvising. Returning to New York in 1958, Davis recruited alto saxophonist Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley. Coltrane, who in the meantime had freed himself from his drug habits, was available after a highly fruitful experience with Thelonious Monk and was hired back, as was Philly Joe Jones. With the quintet re-formed as a sextet, Davis recorded Milestones, an album anticipating the new directions he was preparing to give to his music. Almost immediately after the recording of Milestones, Davis fired Garland and, shortly afterward, Jones, again for behavioral problems; he replaced them with Bill Evans--a young white pianist with a strong classical background--and drummer Jimmy Cobb. With this revamped formation, Davis began a year during which the sextet performed and toured extensively and produced a record (1958 Miles, also known as 58 Sessions). Evans had a unique, impressionistic approach to the piano, and his musical ideas had a strong influence on Davis. But after only eight months on the road with the group, he was burned out and left. He was soon replaced by Wynton Kelly, a player who brought to the sextet a swinging, bluesy approach that contrasted with Evans&#x27; more delicate playing. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Davis recorded a series of albums with Gil Evans, often playing flugelhorn as well as trumpet. The first, Miles Ahead (1957), showcased his playing with a jazz big band and a horn section arranged by Evans. Songs included Dave Brubeck&#x27;s &quot;The Duke,&quot; as well as Leo Delibes&#x27;s &quot;The Maids of Cadiz,&quot; the first piece of European classical music Davis had recorded. Another distinctive feature of the album was the orchestral passages that Evans had devised as transitions between the different tracks, which were joined together with the innovative use of editing in the post-production phase, turning each side of the album into a seamless piece of music. In 1958, Davis and Evans were back in the studio to record Porgy and Bess, an arrangement of pieces from George Gershwin&#x27;s opera of the same name. The lineup included three members of the sextet: Paul Chambers, Philly Joe Jones, and Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley. Davis called the album one of his favorites. Sketches of Spain (1959-1960) featured songs by contemporary Spanish composer Joaquin Rodrigo and also Manuel de Falla, as well as Gil Evans originals with a Spanish flavor. Miles Davis at Carnegie Hall (1961) includes Rodrigo&#x27;s Concierto de Aranjuez, along with other compositions recorded in concert with an orchestra under Evans&#x27; direction. Sessions with Davis and Evans in 1962 resulted in the album Quiet Nights, a short collection of bossa novas that was released against the wishes of both artists: Evans stated it was only half an album, and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer Teo Macero, whom he didn&#x27;t speak to for more than two years. This was the last time Evans and Davis made a full album together; despite the professional separation, however, Davis noted later that &quot;my best friend is Gil Evans. &quot; In March and April 1959, Davis re-entered the studio with his working sextet to record what is widely considered his magnum opus, Kind of Blue. He called back Bill Evans, months away from forming what would become his own seminal trio, for the album sessions, as the music had been planned around Evans&#x27; piano style. Both Davis and Evans were personally acquainted with the ideas of pianist George Russell regarding modal jazz, Davis from discussions with Russell and others before the Birth of the Cool sessions, and Evans from study with Russell in 1956. Davis, however, had neglected to inform current pianist Kelly of Evans&#x27; role in the recordings; Kelly subsequently played only on the track &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; and was not present at the April dates for the album. &quot;So What&quot; and &quot;All Blues&quot; had been played by the sextet at performances prior to the recording sessions, but for the other three compositions, Davis and Evans prepared skeletal harmonic frameworks that the other musicians saw for the first time on the day of recording, to allow a fresher approach to their improvisations. The resulting album has proven to be both highly popular and enormously influential. According to the RIAA, Kind of Blue is the best-selling jazz album of all time, having been certified as quadruple platinum (4 million copies sold). In December 2009, the US House of Representatives voted 409-0 to pass a resolution honoring the album as a national treasure. The trumpet Davis used on the recording is currently displayed in the music building on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. It was donated to the school by Arthur &quot;Buddy&quot; Gist, who met Davis in 1949 and became a close friend. The gift was the reason why the jazz program at UNCG is named the &quot;Miles Davis Jazz Studies Program. &quot; Later in 1959, while taking a break outside the famous Birdland nightclub in New York City, Davis along with others were told by a police officer to clear the side walk and subsequently didn&#x27;t. The officer said that he would arrest Miles and reached for his cuffs when Miles leaned toward him (boxing style), the police officer fell backward with his cuffs falling. Seconds later a detective came up behind Miles and hit him on the head with a baton resulting in blood getting on his suit. Miles was then arrested, where in the station police harassed him by bumping into him on purpose. Davis attempted to pursue the case in the courts, before eventually dropping the proceedings in a plea bargain in order to recover his suspended Cabaret Card, enabling him to return to work in New York clubs. Davis persuaded Coltrane to play with the group on one final European tour in the spring of 1960. Coltrane then departed to form his classic quartet, although he returned for some of the tracks on Davis&#x27; 1961 album Someday My Prince Will Come. After Coltrane, Davis tried various saxophonists, including Jimmy Heath, Sonny Stitt, and Hank Mobley. The quintet with Hank Mobley was recorded in the studio and on several live engagements at Carnegie Hall and the Black Hawk jazz club in San Francisco. Stitt&#x27;s playing with the group is found on a recording made in Olympia, Paris (where Davis and Coltrane had played a few months before) and the Live in Stockholm album. In 1963, Davis&#x27; longtime rhythm section of Kelly, Chambers, and Cobb departed. He quickly got to work putting together a new group, including tenor saxophonist George Coleman and bassist Ron Carter. Davis, Coleman, Carter and a few other musicians recorded half the tracks for an album in the spring of 1963. A few weeks later, seventeen-year-old drummer Tony Williams and pianist Herbie Hancock joined the group, and soon afterward Davis, Coleman, and the new rhythm section recorded the rest of Seven Steps to Heaven. The rhythm players melded together quickly as a section and with the horns. The group&#x27;s rapid evolution can be traced through the Seven Steps to Heaven album, In Europe (July 1963), My Funny Valentine (February 1964), and Four and More (also February 1964). The quintet played essentially the same repertoire of bebop tunes and standards that earlier Davis bands had played, but they tackled them with increasing structural and rhythmic freedom and, in the case of the up-tempo material, breakneck speed. Coleman left in the spring of 1964, to be replaced by avant-garde saxophonist Sam Rivers, on the suggestion of Tony Williams. Rivers remained in the group only briefly, but was recorded live with the quintet in Japan; this configuration can be heard on Miles in Tokyo! (July 1964). By the end of the summer, Davis had persuaded Wayne Shorter to leave Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers and join the quintet. Shorter became the group&#x27;s principal composer, and some of his compositions of this era (including &quot;Footprints&quot; and &quot;Nefertiti&quot;) have become standards. While on tour in Europe, the group quickly made their first official recording, Miles in Berlin (September 1964). On returning to the United States later that year, ever the musical entrepreneur, Davis (at Jackie DeShannon&#x27;s urging) was instrumental in getting The Byrds signed to Columbia Records. By the time of E. S. P. (1965), Davis&#x27; lineup consisted of Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter (bass), and Tony Williams (drums). The last of his acoustic bands, this group is often referred to as &quot;the second great quintet. &quot; A two-night Chicago performance in late 1965 is captured on The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965, released in 1995. Unlike their studio albums, the live engagement shows the group still playing primarily standards and bebop tunes. It is reasonable to point out though, that whilst some of the titles remain the same as the tunes employed by the 1950s quintet, the speed and distance of departure from the framework of the standards bears no comparison. It could even be said that the listening experience to these standards as live performances is as much of a radical take on the jazz of the time as the new compositions of the studio albums listed below. The recording of Live at the Plugged Nickel was not issued anywhere in the 1960s, first appearing as a Japan-only partial issue in the late 1970s, then as a double-LP in the USA and Europe in 1982. It was followed by a series of studio recordings: Miles Smiles (1966), Sorcerer (1967), Nefertiti (1967), Miles in the Sky (1968), and Filles de Kilimanjaro (1968). The quintet&#x27;s approach to improvisation came to be known as &quot;time no changes&quot; or &quot;freebop,&quot; because they abandoned the more conventional chord-change-based approach of bebop for a modal approach. Through Nefertiti, the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their live concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of demarcation. Davis&#x27;s bands would continue to perform in this way until his retirement in 1975. Miles in the Sky and Filles de Kilimanjaro, on which electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar were tentatively introduced on some tracks, pointed the way to the subsequent fusion phase of Davis&#x27; career. Davis also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of Filles de Kilimanjaro had been recorded, bassist Dave Holland and pianist Chick Corea had replaced Carter and Hancock in the working band, though both Carter and Hancock would occasionally contribute to future recording sessions. Davis soon began to take over the compositional duties of his sidemen. Davis&#x27; influences included late-1960s acid rock and funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone, James Brown, and Jimi Hendrix, many of whom he met through Betty Mabry (later Betty Davis), a young model and songwriter Davis married in September 1968 and divorced a year later. The musical transition required that Davis and his band adapt to electric instruments in both live performances and the studio. By the time In a Silent Way had been recorded in February 1969, Davis had augmented his quintet with additional players. At various times Hancock or Joe Zawinul was brought in to join Corea on electric keyboards, and guitarist John McLaughlin made the first of his many appearances with Davis. By this point, Shorter was also doubling on soprano saxophone. After recording this album, Williams left to form his group Lifetime and was replaced by Jack DeJohnette. Six months later an even larger group of musicians, including Jack DeJohnette, Airto Moreira, and Bennie Maupin, recorded the double LP Bitches Brew, which became a huge seller, reaching gold status by 1976. This album and In a Silent Way were among the first fusions of jazz and rock that were commercially successful, building on the groundwork laid by Charles Lloyd, Larry Coryell, and others who pioneered a genre that would become known as &quot;jazz-rock fusion&quot;. During this period, Davis toured with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette. The group&#x27;s repertoire included material from Bitches Brew, In a Silent Way, and the 1960s quintet albums, along with an occasional standard. In 1972, Davis was introduced to the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen by Paul Buckmaster, leading to a period of new creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote that &quot;the effect of Davis&#x27; study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long. . . . Davis&#x27; own &#x27;space music&#x27; shows Stockhausen&#x27;s influence compositionally. &quot; His recordings and performances during this period were described as &quot;space music&quot; by fans, by music critic Leonard Feather, and by Buckmaster, who described it as &quot;a lot of mood changes--heavy, dark, intense--definitely space music. &quot; Both Bitches Brew and In a Silent Way feature &quot;extended&quot; (more than 20 minutes each) compositions that were never actually &quot;played straight through&quot; by the musicians in the studio. Instead, Davis and producer Teo Macero selected musical motifs of various lengths from recorded extended improvisations and edited them together into a musical whole that exists only in the recorded version. Bitches Brew made use of such electronic effects as multi-tracking, tape loops, and other editing techniques. Both records, especially Bitches Brew, proved to be big sellers. Starting with Bitches Brew, Davis&#x27; albums began to often feature cover art much more in line with psychedelic art or black power movements than that of his earlier albums. He took significant cuts in his usual performing fees in order to open for rock groups like the Steve Miller Band, the Grateful Dead, and Santana. Several live albums were recorded during the early 1970s at these performances: Live at the Fillmore East (March 7, 1970) - It&#x27;s About That Time, Black Beauty: Miles Davis at Fillmore West, and Miles Davis at Fillmore: Live at the Fillmore East. By the time of Live-Evil in December 1970, Davis&#x27; ensemble had transformed into a much more funk-oriented group. Davis began experimenting with wah-wah effects on his horn. The ensemble with Gary Bartz, Keith Jarrett, and Michael Henderson, often referred to as the &quot;Cellar Door band&quot; (the live portions of Live-Evil were recorded at a Washington, DC, club by that name), never recorded in the studio, but is documented in the six-CD box set The Cellar Door Sessions 1970, which was recorded over four nights in December 1970. In 1970, Davis contributed extensively to the soundtrack of a documentary about the African-American boxer heavyweight champion Jack Johnson. Himself a devotee of boxing, Davis drew parallels between Johnson, whose career had been defined by the fruitless search for a Great White Hope to dethrone him, and Davis&#x27; own career, in which he felt the musical establishment of the time had prevented him from receiving the acclaim and rewards that were due him. The resulting album, 1971&#x27;s A Tribute to Jack Johnson, contained two long pieces that featured musicians (some of whom were not credited on the record) including guitarists John McLaughlin and Sonny Sharrock, Herbie Hancock on a Farfisa organ, and drummer Billy Cobham. McLaughlin and Cobham went on to become founding members of the Mahavishnu Orchestra in 1971. As Davis stated in his autobiography, he wanted to make music for the young African-American audience. On the Corner (1972) blended funk elements with the traditional jazz styles he had played his entire career. The album was highlighted by the appearance of saxophonist Carlos Garnett. Critics were not kind to the album; in his autobiography, Davis stated that critics could not figure out how to categorize it, and he complained that the album was not promoted by the &quot;traditional&quot; jazz radio stations. After recording On the Corner, Davis put together a new group, with only Michael Henderson, Carlos Garnett, and percussionist Mtume returning from the previous band. It included guitarist Reggie Lucas, tabla player Badal Roy, sitarist Khalil Balakrishna, and drummer Al Foster. It was unusual in that none of the sidemen were major jazz instrumentalists; as a result, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of individual solos. This group, which recorded in the Philharmonic Hall for the album In Concert: Live at Philharmonic Hall (1972), was unsatisfactory to Davis. Through the first half of 1973, he dropped the tabla and sitar, took over keyboard duties, and added guitarist Pete Cosey. The Davis/Cosey/Lucas/Henderson/Mtume/Foster ensemble would remain virtually intact over the next two years. Initially, Dave Liebman played saxophones and flute with the band; in 1974, he was replaced by Sonny Fortune. Big Fun (1974) was a double album containing four long improvisations, recorded between 1969 and 1972. Similarly, Get Up With It (1974) collected recordings from the previous five years. Get Up With It included &quot;He Loved Him Madly&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington, as well as one of Davis&#x27; most lauded pieces from this era, &quot;Calypso Frelimo&quot;. It was his last studio album of the 1970s. In 1974 and 1975, Columbia recorded three double-LP live Davis albums: Dark Magus, Agharta, and Pangaea. Dark Magus captures a 1974 New York concert; the latter two are recordings of consecutive concerts from the same February 1975 day in Osaka. At the time, only Agharta was available in the US; Pangaea and Dark Magus were initially released only by CBS/Sony Japan. All three feature at least two electric guitarists (Reggie Lucas and Pete Cosey, deploying an array of Hendrix-inspired electronic distortion devices; Dominique Gaumont is a third guitarist on Dark Magus), electric bass, drums, reeds, and Davis on electric trumpet and organ. These albums were the last he was to record for five years. Davis was troubled by osteoarthritis (which led to a hip replacement operation in 1976, the first of several), sickle-cell anemia, depression, bursitis, ulcers, and a renewed dependence on alcohol and drugs (primarily cocaine), and his performances were routinely panned by critics throughout late 1974 and early 1975. By the time the group reached Japan in February 1975, Davis was nearing a physical breakdown and required copious amounts of alcohol and narcotics to make it through his engagements. Nonetheless, as noted by Richard Cook and Brian Morton, during these concerts his trumpet playing &quot;is of the highest and most adventurous order. &quot; After a Newport Jazz Festival performance at Avery Fisher Hall in New York on July 1, 1975, Davis withdrew almost completely from the public eye for six years. As Gil Evans said, &quot;His organism is tired. And after all the music he&#x27;s contributed for 35 years, he needs a rest. &quot; Davis characterized this period in his memoirs as a colorful time when wealthy women lavished him with sex and drugs. In reality, he had become completely dependent on various drugs, spending nearly all of his time propped up on a couch in his apartment watching television, leaving only to find more drugs. In 1976, Rolling Stone reported rumors of his imminent demise. Although he stopped practicing trumpet on a regular basis, Davis continued to compose intermittently and made three attempts at recording during his exile from performing; these sessions (one with the assistance of Paul Buckmaster and Gil Evans, who left after not receiving promised compensation) bore little fruit and remain unreleased. In 1979, he placed in the yearly top-ten trumpeter poll of Down Beat. Columbia continued to issue compilation albums and records of unreleased vault material to fulfill contractual obligations. During his period of inactivity, Davis saw the fusion music that he had spearheaded over the past decade enter into the mainstream. When he emerged from retirement, Davis&#x27; musical descendants would be in the realm of New Wave rock, and in particular the styling of Prince. By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress Cicely Tyson. With Tyson, Davis would overcome his cocaine addiction and regain his enthusiasm for music. As he had not played trumpet for the better part of three years, regaining his famed embouchure proved to be particularly arduous. While recording The Man with the Horn (sessions were spread sporadically over 1979-1981), Davis played mostly wahwah with a younger, larger band. The initial large band was eventually abandoned in favor of a smaller combo featuring saxophonist Bill Evans and bass player Marcus Miller, both of whom would be among Davis&#x27; most regular collaborators throughout the decade. He married Tyson in 1981; they would divorce in 1988. The Man with the Horn was finally released in 1981 and received a poor critical reception despite selling fairly well. In May, the new band played two dates as part of the Newport Jazz Festival. The concerts, as well as the live recording We Want Miles from the ensuing tour, received positive reviews. By late 1982, Davis&#x27; band included French percussionist Mino Cinelu and guitarist John Scofield, with whom he worked closely on the album Star People. In mid-1983, while working on the tracks for Decoy, an album mixing soul music and electronica that was released in 1984, Davis brought in producer, composer and keyboardist Robert Irving III, who had earlier collaborated with him on The Man with the Horn. With a seven-piece band, including Scofield, Evans, keyboardist and music director Irving, drummer Al Foster and bassist Darryl Jones (later of The Rolling Stones), Davis played a series of European gigs to positive receptions. While in Europe, he took part in the recording of Aura, an orchestral tribute to Davis composed by Danish trumpeter Palle Mikkelborg. You&#x27;re Under Arrest, Davis&#x27; next album, was released in 1985 and included another brief stylistic detour. Included on the album were his interpretations of Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s ballad &quot;Time After Time,&quot; and &quot;Human Nature&quot; from Michael Jackson. Davis considered releasing an entire album of pop songs and recorded dozens of them, but the idea was scrapped. Davis noted that many of today&#x27;s accepted jazz standards were in fact pop songs from Broadway theater, and that he was simply updating the &quot;standards&quot; repertoire with new material. You&#x27;re Under Arrest also proved to be Davis&#x27; final album for Columbia. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis publicly dismissed Davis&#x27; more recent fusion recordings as not being &quot;&#x27;true&#x27; jazz&quot;, comments Davis initially shrugged off, calling Marsalis &quot;a nice young man, only confused&quot;. This changed after Marsalis appeared, unannounced, onstage in the midst of a Davis performance. Marsalis whispered into Davis&#x27; ear that &quot;someone&quot; had told him to do so; Davis responded by ordering him off the stage. Davis grew irritated at Columbia&#x27;s delay releasing Aura. The breaking point in the label-artist relationship appears to have come when a Columbia jazz producer requested Davis place a goodwill birthday call to Marsalis. Davis signed with Warner Brothers shortly thereafter. Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British new wave movement during this period, including Scritti Politti. At the invitation of producer Bill Laswell, Davis recorded some trumpet parts during sessions for Public Image Ltd&#x27;s Album, according to Public Image&#x27;s John Lydon in the liner notes of their Plastic Box box set. In Lydon&#x27;s words, however, &quot;strangely enough, we didn&#x27;t use (his contributions). &quot; (Also according to Lydon in the Plastic Box notes, Davis favorably compared Lydon&#x27;s singing voice to his trumpet sound. ) Having first taken part in the Artists United Against Apartheid recording, Davis signed with Warner Brothers records and reunited with Marcus Miller. The resulting record, Tutu (1986), would be his first to use modern studio tools -- programmed synthesizers, samples and drum loops -- to create an entirely new setting for Davis&#x27; playing. Ecstatically reviewed on its release, the album would frequently be described as the modern counterpart of Sketches of Spain and won a Grammy in 1987. He followed Tutu with Amandla, another collaboration with Miller and George Duke, plus the soundtracks to four movies: Street Smart, Siesta, The Hot Spot, and Dingo. He continued to tour with a band of constantly rotating personnel and a critical stock at a level higher than it had been for 15 years. His last recordings, both released posthumously, were the hip hop-influenced studio album Doo-Bop and Miles &amp; Quincy Live at Montreux, a collaboration with Quincy Jones for the 1991 Montreux Jazz Festival in which Davis performed the repertoire from his 1940s and 1950s recordings for the first time in decades. In 1988 he had a small part as a street musician in the film Scrooged, starring Bill Murray. He received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1990. In 1989, Miles was interviewed on the television show &#x27;60 minutes&#x27; by Harry Reasoner. In early 1991, he appeared in the Rolf de Heer film Dingo as a jazz musician. In the film&#x27;s opening sequence, Davis and his band unexpectedly land on a remote airstrip in the Australian outback and proceed to perform for the stunned locals. The performance was one of Davis&#x27; last on film. Miles Davis died on September 28, 1991 from a stroke, pneumonia and respiratory failure in Santa Monica, California at the age of 65. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx. Miles Davis is regarded as one of the most innovative, influential and respected figures in the history of jazz music. He has been described as \"one of the great innovators in jazz\". The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll noted &quot;Miles Davis played a crucial and inevitably controversial role in every major development in jazz since the mid-&#x27;40s, and no other jazz musician has had so profound an effect on rock. Miles Davis was the most widely recognized jazz musician of his era, an outspoken social critic and an arbiter of style - in attitude and fashion - as well as music&quot; . His album Kind of Blue is the best-selling album in the history of jazz music and was praised by the United States House of Representatives to &quot;pass a symbolic resolution honoring the masterpiece and reaffirming jazz as a national treasure. &quot; As an innovative bandleader and composer, Miles Davis has influenced many notable musicians and bands from diverse genres. These include Wayne Shorter, Cannonball Adderley, Herbie Hancock, Lalo Schifrin, Tangerine Dream, Brand X, Mtume, Benny Bailey, Joe Bonner, Don Cherry, Urszula Dudziak, Bill Evans, Bill Hardman, The Lounge Lizards, Hugh Masekela , John McLaughlin, King Crimson, Steely Dan, Frank Zappa, Radiohead, The Flaming Lips, Lydia Lunch, Talk Talk, Michael Franks, Sting, Lonnie Liston Smith, Jiri Stivin, Tim Hagans, Julie Christensen, Vassar Clements, Snooky Young, Prince and Christian Scott. Miles&#x27; influence on the people who played with him has been described by music writer and author Christopher Smith as follows: Miles Davis&#x27; artistic interest was in the creation and manipulation of ritual space, in which gestures could be endowed with symbolic power sufficient to form a functional communicative, and hence musical, vocabulary. Miles&#x27; performance tradition emphasized orality and the transmission of information and artistic insight from individual to individual. His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance. His approach, owing largely to the African American performance tradition that focused on individual expression, emphatic interaction, and creative response to shifting contents, had a profound impact on generations of jazz musicians. In 1986, the New England Conservatory awarded Miles Davis an Honorary Doctorate for his extraordinary contributions to music. Since 1960 the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) has honored him with eight Grammy Awards, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, and three Grammy Hall of Fame Awards. ", "HIM": "There are multiple artists with this name: 1) HIM is an alternative rock band from Finland. 2) HiM, a solo project put together in 1995 by Doug Scharin (drummer for June of 44, Rex, and Codeine). 3) HIM, acronym for &quot;Hiromasa Ijichi Melodies,&quot; a Japanese group. \t 1) Formed in 1991 by vocalist Ville Valo, guitarist Mikko Lindstrom (Linde), and bassist Mikko Paananen(Mige). Today the band consists of the previously named as well as a drummer Mika Karppinen(Gas) and a keyboardist Janne Puurtinen(Burton). The name HIM was originally an abbreviation for &quot;His Infernal Majesty&quot;, but was changed to the initials to avoid confusion with the occult. The name &quot;HIM&quot; later caused confusion when touring in the US, because of another band using the same name ( read below at 2) ). For this reason, the band was -jokingly - for some time known as &quot;HER&quot; in the States, and even more jokingly HIM&amp;Her in Germany. \t The EP, &#x27;666 Ways to Love: Prologue&#x27; (1996) was their EP released only in Finland and only 1,000 were produced making it worth up to $700 and has been sold on eBay for more. HIM&#x27;s first full length album &quot;Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666&quot; (1997) gained European fame due to the success of the cover of Wicked Game the album also featured a popular cover of (Don&#x27;t Fear) The Reaper. \t \t HIM&#x27;s second release, &#x27;Razorblade Romance&#x27; (2000) was a success in Europe as well as in America due to the singles Gone With The Sinand Join Me in Death (the single was named &quot;Join Me&quot;, to avoid interpretations of the track encouraging suicide). Initially Razorblade Romance was released under the pen-name &quot;HER&quot; in America as the name HIM was already copyrighted. After purchasing the rights to the name, Razorblade Romance was re-pressed under the name HIM. For their third album, HIM released, Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights (2001), spawning the popular singles In Joy and Sorrow, Pretending and Heartache Every Moment \t Love Metal, HIM&#x27;s fourth album, was released in 2003 in Europe but was not released in the US until 2005. It featured the hit singles Buried Alive By Love, The Sacrament and Funeral of Hearts. The entire album was played, track by track, live in Hamburg in 2003. This show is known as &quot;Live Metal&quot;, and can be obtained on several bootlegs both on DVD and CD. Their fifth album, Dark Light (2005) features the hit singles Wings of a Butterflyand Killing Loneliness. was the first Finnish album to sell to gold in the US. It also went on to gain HIM major success in the UK. \t HIM&#x27;s sixth album, Venus Doom was released officially around the world 14-18 September 200. The video for the main single on the album, Kiss of Dawn, was shown on british Scuzz TV on August 10. The album also features HIM&#x27;s longest track to date Sleepwalking Past Hope, which is 10 minutes and 3 seconds long. The other single from Venus Doom was Bleed Well. HIM went on to release Screamworks: Love In Practice and Theory in 2010. Their first single of the album Heartkiller released a couple of weeks before the albums release, which was a week before valentines day. Ville said that the album was originally written for a release date on 14 February 2010, stating that alot of the albums influence was about a previous relationship and that he wanted her to hear it on valentines day. \t Additionally, the band has released three compilation albums; &#x27;And Love Said No&#x27; (2004) and &#x27;Uneasy Listening Vol. 1&#x27; (2006) &amp; &#x27;Uneasy Listening Vol. 2&#x27; (2007). It is also worth mentioning that all of their albums and singles (not the EP) has been released in multiple versions, with various bonus tracks and special edition covers, etc. \t HIM uses a widely famous logo called the &#x27;heartagram&#x27;, which is a pentagram crossed with a heart. It&#x27;s also been said that Valo designed it as he waited for his friends to bring over beer on his 20th birthday and was inspired by this Finnish private hospital logo. The symbol represents the balance between love and hate, life and death, dark and light, good and evil and sometimes love and death. Because of this logo they have been wrongly labeled as satanic. Valo originally wanted to make several symbols, like Led Zeppelin did, but realised he didn&#x27;t have the drawing talent to pen them, nor the memory to remember them. \t Bam Margera has legal licensing rights to this logo in America, which he acquired off Valo. The two have been friends since Margera saw the band perform in Finland, and was let in backstage by the band. He has directed a number of HIM videos, including Buried Alive By Love, where the actress and rockstar Juliette Lewis also appears. Valo has also appeared in episodes of Margera&#x27;s TV show called Viva la Bam, and the CKY videos. Margera has used HIM&#x27;s music for nearly all of his projects, including the feature film Haggard\t \t In 2001 Mikko Lindstrom, Mikko Paananen, and Ville Valo had a side project called Daniel Lioneye. Ville Valo was using a covername Bil Bao and his face was covered in their video for &quot;Never Been In Love (Till the Day I Die)&quot;. This band&#x27;s hit called &quot;The King of Rock&#x27;n Roll&quot; is a theme song of Viva la Bam. Official site: www. heartagram. com \t\t 2) HiM is a dub influenced post-rock group formed in 1995 by Doug Scharin, drummer for the bands Codeine, Rex and June of 44. Their first album, Egg, was their most dub-based effort. Each successive album has gone more in a quasi-world music direction. After some recording for Crooklyn Dub Consortium and Wordsound, &quot;Interpretive Belief System&quot;, HiM settled on a lineup of Scharin with Bundy K. Brown, Rob Mazurek and Jeff Parker, members or occasional members of Tortoise and Isotope 217. Their first album was the underground hit Sworn Eyes, produced by . A few personnel changes followed, and the revamped lineup including members of June of 44, Golden released Our Point of Departure in 1999, which signified a very clear shift toward a more jazz-like sound, followed by a major American and European tour. In 2003, HiM released Many In High Places Are Not Well on Fat Cat Records, which was received as their most successful and fully realized release. Peoples was released in mid-2006, featuring a cleaner sound with more vocals than any of HiM&#x27;s previous releases. Included in this line-up are Martin Perna and Jordan McLean from Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, Griffin Rodriguez from Need New Body/Icy Demons, Adam Pierce (Mice Parade).

An ambient project (see gh((o))st) 1) Heavy / Proto-doom metal band formed 2008 in Sweden. Ghost is the name of a devil worshipping ministry that - in order to spread their unholy gospels and, furthermore, trick mankind into believing that the end is ultimately a good thing - have decided to use the ever so popular rock music medium as a way to achieve their ends. Standing motionless and anonymous beneath the painted faces, hoods and robes which their sect demand, the six nameless ghouls of Ghost deliver litanies of sexually pulsating heavy rock music and romantic lyrics, that glorify and glamorise the disgusting and sacrilegious, with the simple intention to communicate a message of pure evil via the most effective device they can find - entertainment. In May 2010 Ghost were contracted to a UK based gramophone company called Rise Above Ltd, who swore an oath stating that they will assist the group in the task of spreading their musical blasphemies through formats such as Compact Discs, Long Playing Vinyl Records and something referred to as Digital Downloading, whatever that is&#8230; The first Long Playing Ghost album &quot;Opus Eponymous&quot; will be released in October 2010 and it is understood and agreed that Rise Above Ltd will spend money on magazine advertising, retail marketing and will employ the services of music publicity specialists in order to expose the music of Ghost to the wider public. Specific attention will be paid to targeting people (research suggests these are most likely to be adolescents) who have a void in their life, perhaps caused by some form of emotional trauma or upset, that can be filled by the music and philosophies of Ghost. In time, these easily manipulated children will come to share the views and goals of the Ghost ministry and can prepare their own plans for the downfall of humanity&#8230;&quot; &quot;Real names of the band members are not revealed. &quot; http://www. myspace. com/thebandghost 2) Ghost is an experimental rock group formed in Tokyo, Japan, in 1984. Core-member Masaki Batoh grew up in Kyoto, Japan where he attended a private school. During this time, he became interested in American and British rock music ranging from Bob Dylan and Pink Floyd to the Velvet Underground and Japanese rock bands such as the Taj Mahal Travellers and the Flower Travellin&#x27; Band. Later, Batoh formed Ghost with a large and often varying lineup. According to reports posted on Allmusic, the group lived a nomadic existence, drifting from ruins of ancient temples to disused subway stations around the Tokyo area. The band began releasing their work with the albums Ghost and Second Time Around, which were released, respectively, in 1991 and 1992. The American independent label Drag City licensed each of the albums for distribution, and the Los Angeles The Now Sound label picked up two of Batoh&#x27;s solo albums, released together as well under the title Collected Works. Two albums, Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet and Snuffbox Immanence, were released simultaneously in 1999. As well as their own work, Ghost have recorded and performed with the ex-Galaxie 500 duo Damon and Naomi. Five years after releasing both Snuffbox Immanence and Tune In, Turn On, Free Tibet, Ghost returned with Hypnotic Underworld, and there were some changes in the band. Cellist Hiromichi Sakamoto and percussionist Setsuko Furuya left and were replaced by a rhythm section of Takuyuki Moriya (electric bass guitar, double bass, and cello) and Junzo Tateiwa (drums, tabla, and percussion). In January 2007, Ghost released its latest studio album titled In Stormy Nights. 3) http://ghost. bandcamp. com A British hip hop/trip hop/electronic producer on the Breakin Bread label.

", "Caetano Veloso": "Caetano Veloso (born 7 August 1942) is one of the most popular and influential Brazilian composers and singers. He was born in Santo Amaro da Purificacao, Bahia, Brasil, the fifth of the seven children born to Jose Telles Veloso (&quot;Seu Zezinho&quot;) and Claudionor Vianna Telles Veloso (&quot;Dona Cano&quot;). His younger sister, Maria Bethania, preceded him to fame as a singer in the mid-1960s. He began his career around 1965 singing bossa nova and he has cited his greatest musical influences from his early period as Joao Gilberto and Dorival Caymmi. (Joao Gilberto would say later about Caetano&#x27;s contribution that it added an intellectual dimension to brazilian popular music. ) But with such musical collaborators Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Tom Ze, Chico Buarque, and Os Mutantes, and greatly influenced by the later work of The Beatles, developed tropicalismo, which fused Brazilian pop with rock and roll and avant garde art music resulting in a more international, psychedelic, and socially aware sound. Veloso&#x27;s politically active stance, unapologetically leftist, earned him the enmity of Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship which ruled until 1985; his songs were frequently censored, and some were banned. Veloso was also alienated from the socialist left in Brazil becasue of his acceptance and integration of non-nationalist influences (like rock and roll) in his music. Veloso and Gilberto Gil spent several months in jail for &quot;anti-government activity&quot; in 1968 and eventually exiled themselves to London. Caetano Veloso&#x27;s work upon his return in 1972 was often characterized by frequent appropriations not only of international styles, but of half-forgotten Brazilian folkloric styles and rhythms as well. In particular, his celebration of the Afro-Brazilian culture of Bahia can be seen as the precursor of such Afro-centric groups as Timbalada. In the 1980s, Veloso&#x27;s popularity outside Brazil grew, especially in Israel, Portugal, France and Africa. By 2004, he was one of the most respected and prolific international pop stars, with more than fifty recordings available, including songs in soundtracks of movies such as Pedro Almodovar&#x27;s Hable con Ella (Talk to Her), and Frida. In 2002 Veloso published an account of his early years and the Tropicalia movement, Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil. His first all-English CD was A Foreign Sound (2004), which covers Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Come as You Are&quot; and compositions from the Great American Songbook. Five of the six songs on his third eponymous album, released in 1971, were also in English. ", "Tomita": "Isao Tomita ( Fu Tian  Xun  , Tomita Isao, born April 22, 1932), often known simply as Tomita, is a Japanese music composer, regarded as one of the pioneers of electronic music and space music, and as one of the most famous producers of analog synthesizer arrangements. In addition to creating note-by-note realizations, Tomita made extensive use of the sound design capabilities of his instrument, using synthesizers to create new artificial sounds to accompany and enhance his electronic realizations of acoustic instruments. He also made effective use of analog music sequencers and featured futuristic science fiction themes, while laying the foundations for synth-pop music and trance-like rhythms. He also received four Grammy Award nominations for his album Snowflakes are Dancing in 1974. Tomita bridged the gap between note-by-note classical/electronic LPs like Switched-On Bach and the more futuristic, user-friendly interfaces developed in the 1970s. After creating one of the first personal recording studios with an array of top synthesizer gear in the early &#x27;70s, Tomita applied his visions for space-age synthesizer music to his favorite modern composers &ndash; Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel &ndash; though his recordings steered a course beyond the academicism of Wendy Carlos and other synthesists. Born in Tokyo in 1932, Tomita grew up in China as well as Japan, studying composition and music theory as well as art history at Keio University. After graduation in 1955, Tomita began composing film, television and theater music. He was awarded frequently during the 1950s and &#x27;60s, and became perhaps the most well-known contemporary Japanese composer. In 1965, he composed the theme song and incidental music for Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s animated TV series Jangaru Taitei (Jungle Emperor), released in the USA as Kimba the White Lion. In 1966 he wrote a tone poem based on this music with an original video animation synchronized to the tone poem released in 1991. Isao Tomita and Kunio Miyauchi also created the music for the tokusatsu SF/espionage/action TV series Mighty Jack, which aired in 1968. By the early &#x27;70s, Isao Tomita was introduced to the seminal work of synthesizer gurus Wendy Carlos and Robert Moog, sparking his own interest in synthesized music. In 1973, he formed the electronic collective Plasma Music with musicians Kinji Kitashoji and Mitsuo Miyamoto, and spent more than a year stocking his home studio with electronics gear (including the Moog III used for Carlos&#x27; Switched-On Bach). Tomita&#x27;s first album, 1974&#x27;s Snowflakes Are Dancing, electrified the Japanese public and even translated to an American classical audience, where it was nominated for four Grammy awards. Successive albums Pictures at an Exhibition, The Firebird Suite and his masterpiece Holst: The Planets infused the classical-synthesizer fusion craze of the 1970s with genuinely exciting, futuristic music instead of the bland, note-by-note translations favored by less visionary musicians. The Planets re-invoked the connection between synthesizer music and science fiction first broached in the 1956 film Forbidden Planet. Tomita began incorporating digital synth and early MIDI setups with 1982&#x27;s Grand Canyon, and completely gutted his studio during the next two years during the transition from analogue to digital with his Casio Cosmo system. Though he recorded more sparingly than in the 1970s, Tomita made frequent appearances at enormous concerts, including his 1984 Austrian show Mind of the Universe before 80,000 people and at the Statue of Liberty centennial celebration two years later. Tomita was also awarded the honorary presidency of the Japan Synthesizer Programmers Association. ", "Leonard Cohen": "Leonard Cohen (b. 21st September 1934 in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian poet, novelist and musician. His musical career has largely overshadowed his prior work as a poet and novelist, although he continued to publish poetry sporadically after his breakthrough in the music industry. In 1967, disappointed with his lack of financial success as a writer, Cohen moved to the United States to pursue a career as a folk music singer-songwriter. During the 1960s, he was a fringe figure in Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Factory&quot; crowd. Warhol speculated that Cohen had spent time listening to Nico in clubs and that this had influenced his musical style. His song &quot;Suzanne&quot; became a hit for Judy Collins and was for many years his most covered song. After performing at a few folk festivals, he came to the attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond who signed Cohen to a record deal. Musically, Cohen&#x27;s early songs are based in folk music, in terms of both melody and instrumentation; from the 1970s, though, his work begins to show the influence of various types of popular and cabaret music. Since the 1980s he has typically sung in a deep bass register, accompanied by synthesisers and female backing vocals. Despite not embarking on a tour since 1993, Cohen was forced to go on the road in 2008, following the alleged misappropriation of over five million U. S. dollars from his retirement by his longtime former manager, Kelley Lynch. This left him close to bankruptcy, and Cohen&#x27;s mammoth world tour lasted two and a half years and included 246 shows. Cohen&#x27;s songs are often emotionally heavy and lyrically complex, owing more to the metaphoric word play of poetry than to established conventions of songcraft. His work often explores the themes of religion, isolation, and complex interpersonal relationships. Cohen&#x27;s music has greatly influenced other singer-songwriters, and more than a thousand cover versions of his works have been recorded. He is also popular in his native land, having been inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and awarded the Order of Canada, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honour. ", "Cicero": "http://www. cicero. net. br/ Cicero Lins was born in Rio de Janeiro and is a Brazilian singer-songwriter with great influences from Bossa Nova and folk besides artists like Radiohead and Caetano Veloso. In June of 2011 he recorded his first album, Cancoes de Apartamento (Apartment Songs), and made it avaiable to dowload in his official website. It was recorded in his own lo-fi studio, at his apartment. In addition to the piano and the guitar, the album has experiences with other musical intruments like acordeon, tambourine, pandeiro and electric guitar accompanied his whispered lyrics about loneliness, passion, nostalgia and memories. In August of 2013 he released his second album, named Sabado (Saturday), and has also made it available for free download in his official website. The album was recorded on several houses where the musician had been, counting with the collaboration of many musicians friends. ", "Engenheiros do Hawaii": "Engenheiros do Hawaii (&quot;Engineers from/of Hawaii&quot;, a. k. a. EngHaw) is a Brazilian rock band formed in 1985 in the city of Porto Alegre. Their style crosses a variety of genres including progressive rock, alternative rock, folk rock, new wave, post-punk and pop rock. They achieved great popularity with their ironic, critically charged songs with heavily semantic lyrics often relying on wordplays. The current formation includes: Humberto Gessinger (Guitar, Lead Vocals), Paulinho Galvao (Guitar), Bernardo Fonseca (Bass), Glaucio Ayala (Drums) and Pedro Augusto (Keyboards). ", "Elliott Smith": "Steven Paul &quot;Elliott&quot; Smith (August 6, 1969 - October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his &quot;whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery&quot; and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies. After playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars . In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records , for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting , was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997. Smith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill , which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004. Early life Steven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (nee Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, &quot;I didn&#x27;t get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won&#x27;t forget about it although I&#x27;m tempted to &#x27;cause I don&#x27;t like it there. &quot; Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of &quot;Some Song&quot;: &quot;Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you&#x27;re going to be a freak. &quot; The name &quot;Charlie&quot; also appeared in the lyrics for &quot;Flowers for Charlie&quot; and &quot;No Confidence Man&quot;. The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith&#x27;s childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him &quot;really scared of hell&quot;. In a 2001 interview, he stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it&quot;. At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, &quot;Fantasy,&quot; which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother&#x27;s side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club. At 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or &quot; Johnny Panic &quot;. He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar . After graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself &quot;Elliott&quot;, saying that he thought &quot;Steve&quot; sounded too much like a &quot;jock&quot; name, and that &quot;Steven&quot; sounded &quot;too bookish&quot;. Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey. Heatmiser Smith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. &quot;Went straight through in four years,&quot; he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. &quot;I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn&#x27;t want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, &#x27;This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did. &#x27; Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day. &quot; After he graduated he &quot;worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory. &quot; While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records , and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996). Smith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons &#x27; release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records . A clause in Heatmiser&#x27;s record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO . Roman Candle His first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith&#x27;s girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of &quot;the most recent eight songs that recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar&quot; to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said &quot;I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately. &quot; Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: &quot;The idea of playing for people didn&#x27;t occur to me&#8230; because at the time it was the Northwest - Mudhoney and Nirvana - and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off. &quot; The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled &quot;Kiwi Maddog 20/20&quot; (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation. Smith&#x27;s debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U. S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs &quot;I Figured You Out&quot;, which he once called &quot;a stupid pop song in about a minute&quot; that he discarded for &quot; like the fucking Eagles. &quot; Elliott Smith and Either/Or In 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle , but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on &quot;St. Ides Heaven&quot;, and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on &quot;Single File&quot;. Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album&#x27;s pervasive mood gave him &quot;a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,&quot; and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music. In 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or , another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard , which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God. By this time, Smith&#x27;s already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective. Miss Misery and the Oscars In 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting . Smith recorded an orchestral version of &quot;Between the Bars (Orchestral)&quot; with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, &quot;Miss Misery,&quot; and three other previously released tracks (&quot;No Name #3&quot;, from Roman Candle , and &quot;Angeles&quot; and &quot;Say Yes&quot;, from Either/Or ). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for &quot;Miss Misery&quot;. Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night -- either by him or another musician of their choosing. On March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O&#x27;Brien performing &quot;Miss Misery&quot; solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award. Smith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: &quot;That&#x27;s exactly what it was, surreal&#8230; I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn&#x27;t come to hear me play. I wouldn&#x27;t want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day. &quot; XO and Figure 8 In 1998, after the success of Either/Or and &quot;Miss Misery&quot;, Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, &quot;Um, yeah - I jumped off a cliff. But it didn&#x27;t work. &quot; Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle ), said about this time in Smith&#x27;s life: &quot;I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him. &quot; Smith&#x27;s first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO , it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song &quot;Independence Day&quot;. His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith&#x27;s backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes&#x27;s ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed &quot;Waltz #2. &quot; His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes. In response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: &quot;&#8230;sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they&#x27;re actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there&#x27;s a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music. &quot; Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting. Figure 8 , which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a &quot;sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures. &quot; However, some reviewers felt that Smith&#x27;s trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to &quot;the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary. &quot; Album art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O&#x27;Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith&#x27;s condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour. Final years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill A follow-up to Smith&#x27;s 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: &quot;There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn&#x27;t want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs. &quot; When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith. One of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song &quot;Needle in the Hay&quot; in Wes Anderson &#x27;s dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums . The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Hey Jude&quot; for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra&#x27;s version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith &quot;was in a bad state&quot; at the time. Smith&#x27;s live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland&#x27;s Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of &quot;memory-loss and butterfingers&quot;. The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them. In the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University&#x27;s &quot;A&amp;O Ball&quot; with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith&#x27;s performance was described as &quot;undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician&quot; and an &quot;excruciating&#8230; nightmare&quot;. A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement &quot;&#8230;it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year. &quot; On November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith&#x27;s hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith&#x27;s, stated concern over Smith&#x27;s appearance and actions, saying that he &quot;saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn&#x27;t want in a person. It&#x27;s not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner. &quot; Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he &quot;couldn&#x27;t honestly do the first step&#8230; I couldn&#x27;t say what you were supposed to say and mean it. &quot; In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: &quot;What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you&#x27;re on a drip bag, but the only thing that&#x27;s in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I&#x27;m not psychotic. &quot; After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith&#x27;s troubles and apparent recovery: &quot;I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth. . . He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music. &quot; With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba&#x27;s iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording &quot;The California Frown&quot; (a play on the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;California Sound&quot;). He said of the songs: &quot;They&#x27;re kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren&#x27;t too many like that. Lately I&#x27;ve just been making up a lot of noise. &quot; He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star&#x27;s &quot;Thirteen&quot;, and Cat Stevens&#x27; &quot;Trouble&quot;. In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for &quot;Pretty (Ugly Before)&quot;, a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith&#x27;s life as being &quot;like the light at the end of the tunnel&quot; and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered. Death and reactions Elliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p. m. While Smith&#x27;s death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry--love, Elliott. God forgive me. &quot; According to Pitchfork , producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: &quot;I hadn&#x27;t talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me and asked if I&#x27;d like to come to L. A. and help mix and finish . I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand, he was so healthy. &quot; The coroner&#x27;s report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further. Soon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith&#x27;s songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith&#x27;s honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith&#x27;s former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006. Since Smith&#x27;s death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (&quot;Ripchord&quot; and &quot;It Just Is&quot; on More Adventurous ), Sparta (&quot;Bombs and Us&quot;), Ben Folds (&quot;Late&quot; on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (&quot;Elliott Smith&quot; on Symphony of Decay ), Mary Lorson (&quot;Lonely Boy&quot; on Realistic ), Rhett Miller (&quot;The Believer&quot; on The Believer ), Earlimart (&quot;Heaven Adores You&quot; on Treble and Tremble ), Pete Yorn (&quot;Bandstand in the Sky&quot; on Nightcrawler , a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (&quot;Faith&quot; on the &quot;Room&quot; EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith . Posthumous releases From a Basement on the Hill , with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records ). With Smith&#x27;s family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith&#x27;s ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a &quot;bonus disc&quot;), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as &quot;True Love&quot; (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), &quot;Abused&quot;, &quot;Stickman&quot; and &quot;Suicide Machine&quot; (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, &quot;Tiny Time Machine&quot;). It is rumored that it was the family&#x27;s wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion &#x27;s A. V. Club wrote that &quot;the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work&#8230;the album still earns its place--not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend--in a jarringly important body of work. &quot; Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing , a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill , barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician&#x27;s death. Smith&#x27;s family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while &quot;Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith&#x27;s life, he can offer little meaningful insight&quot; and that Smith&#x27;s fans &quot;will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography. &quot; On May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U. S. , the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic &#x27;s 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In , a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon. On October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and &quot;revealing talks with Smith&#x27;s inner circle&quot;. De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release. Musical style and influences Smith respected and was inspired by many artists and styles, including U2, The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown and flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith&#x27;s and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith &quot;listened almost exclusively to slow jams&quot; in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett , T. S. Eliot , and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists). Smith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: &quot;My father taught me how to play &quot;Don&#x27;t Think Twice, It&#x27;s All Right&quot;. I love Dylan&#x27;s words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words. &quot; Smith covered Dylan&#x27;s &quot;When I Paint My Masterpiece&quot; several times in concert. Smith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about &quot;four years old&quot; and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song &quot;Because&quot; to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (&quot;Revolution (Beatles Cover)&quot;, during the sessions for XO ), and played many songs by both the band and the members&#x27; solo projects at live concerts. Regarding his songwriting, Smith said: \"The way I think about it is&#8230; I don&#x27;t really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That&#x27;s an interesting thing to talk about but it&#x27;s difficult. I&#x27;m really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I&#x27;m not like a&#8230; I don&#x27;t make up &#x27;a riff&#x27; really. It&#x27;s usually like&#8230; that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that. \" Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. ", "Skrillex   Diplo": "", "Pianos Become the Teeth": "Pianos Become the Teeth are an American post-hardcore band from Baltimore, Maryland. They perform a style of music inspired by post-rock and early screamo acts. The group reissued their debut album Old Pride in 2010 through Topshelf Records. Pianos Become The Teeth formed in late 2006 in Baltimore, Maryland. Their first release, the Saltwater EP, was released in 2008 through Doomed by Dawn Records. In early 2009 Pianos Become The Teeth released a split EP with Ezra Joyce. Their contributed track, &quot;Creatures of Habit,&quot; was a darker song similar to the material that was recorded for their follow-up first full-length. Pianos Become The Teeth released their debut album, Old Pride in 2009 through Blackjaw Records. They subsequently signed to Topshelf Recordings in October 2009, and reissued their debut album in January 2010 through digital media outlets and on CD. The Topshelf version of Old Pride saw a much wider release that was met with much acclaim. Andrew Kelham of Rock Sound gave the album a nine out of ten, and wrote that &quot;With a why-just-write-a-song-when-you-can-write-an-epic attitude, the eight songs on their second record are distinguished, articulate and immersive as their juddering post-hardcore clashes with moments of Explosions in the Sky rivalling tenderness and Mogwai-esque grandeur. &quot; Writing for Alternative Press, Brian Shultz gave the album four out of five stars and said that the group has, &quot;quietly refined their craft over the last few years into an incredibly cathartic and sporadically chilling mode. Their screamo peers&ndash;past or present&ndash;should be more than envious. &quot; Old Pride was released on vinyl in June 2010 as a joint release through Topshelf Records and Mayfly Records. In support of the album, Pianos Become The Teeth toured the US with Touche Amore and Lemuria. In October 2010, Pianos Become The Teeth released a split EP with The Saddest Landscape through Just Say No! Records. In January 2011, the Pianos Become The Teeth had begun writing a new album, and described the new songs as being &quot;darker and heavier&quot; than previous material, and that they would not become &quot;Old Pride part 2,&quot; alluding to new musical direction. Recording began on August 1, 2011 at Developing Nations Studio with producer Kevin Bernsten. Topshelf Records released the LP The Lack Long After on November 1, 2011, with a supporting tour with Touche Amore and Seahaven following shortly after. Pianos Become the Teeth signed with Epitaph Records in 2014 and will release its third studio album, Keep You, on October 28 of that year. The Will Yip-produced album is noted for its stylistic departure from earlier releases, featuring less a aggressive sound and no screamed vocals from Kyle Durfey. The band promoted the album with an online stream of &quot;Repine&quot; in August 2014. ", "James Brown": "James Brown (b. James Joseph Brown , 3 May 1933, in Barnwell, SC, USA - d. 25 Dec 2006), is recognized as one of the most influential figures in 20th century music. He was a seminal force in the evolution of gospel and rhythm and blues into soul and funk. He has also left his mark on numerous other musical genres, including rock, jazz, reggae, disco, dance and electronic music, and hip-hop music. Joining Bobby Byrd &#x27;s vocal group The Famous Flames, in 1955, Brown &#x27;s early mid-50s recordings were fairly straightforward gospel-inspired R&amp;B compositions, heavily influenced by contemporaries, including: Ray Charles and Little Richard , who was particularly significant in Brown &#x27;s development as a musician and showman. Brown followed his successful Live at the Apollo (1963), with a string of singles that - along with the work of Allen Toussaint , in New Orleans - essentially defined the foundation of funk music. During the mid-1960s, two of Brown &#x27;s signature tunes Papa&#x27;s Got a Brand New Bag and I Got You (I Feel Good) (both from 1965), were his first Top 10 pop hits, as well as major #1 R&amp;B hits - each remaining the top-selling singles, in black venues, for over a month. As the 1960s neared their end, Brown continued to refine the new funk idiom. His 1967 #1 R&amp;B hit, Cold Sweat - sometimes cited as the first true funk song - was the first of his recordings to contain a drum break and harmony reduced to a single chord change. His recordings influenced many contemporaries / followers, most immediately: Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Charles Wright &amp; the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Booker T. &amp; the M. G. &#x27;s, Edwin Starr, The Temptations, David Ruffin , Dennis Edwards and The Jackson 5&#x27;s young lead singer, Michael Jackson , took Brown &#x27;s shouts / dancing into pop mainstream. Many Clyde Stubblefield (drums) / The Famous Flames tracks were resurrected, from the 1970s onward, by countless hip-hop musicians. As a result, Brown / Stubblefield quickly became, and remain, the world&#x27;s most sampled recording artists, with their Funky Drummer break becoming the most sampled individual piece of music, the Funky Drummer break . By 1970 Brown and Byrd employed a new band that included future funk greats, such as bassist Bootsy Collins, Collins&#x27; guitarist brother Phelps &#x27;Catfish&#x27; Collins and trombonist and musical director Fred Wesley. This new backing band was dubbed The J. B. &#x27;s, and the band made its debut on Brown&#x27;s 1970 single Get Up (I Feel Like Being A) Sex Machine. Many of his sidemen and supporting players, such as Fred Wesley &amp; The J. B. &#x27;s, Bobby Byrd, Lyn Collins, Vicki Anderson and Hank Ballard, released records on Brown&#x27;s People label. The recordings on the People label, almost all of which were produced by Brown himself, exemplified his &quot;house style&quot;. Songs such as I Know You Got Soul by Bobby Byrd, Think (About It) by Lyn Collins and Doing It to Death by Fred Wesley &amp; The J. B. &#x27;s are considered as much a part of Brown&#x27;s recorded legacy as the recordings released under his own name. Although he would continue tour and rack up hit records into the 2000s, By the mid-1970s Brown&#x27;s star-status was on the wane, and key musicians in his band such as Fred Wesley left to join Parliament and Funkadelic. The onslaught of the slickly commercial style of disco caught Brown off guard, as it superseded his raw style of funk music on the dance floor. Brown is recognized by a plethora of (mostly self-bestowed) titles, including &quot;Soul Brother Number One,&quot; &quot;Mr. Dynamite,&quot; &quot;the Hardest-Working Man in Show Business,&quot; &quot;Minister of New New Super-Heavy Funk,&quot; &quot;Universal James,&quot; and the best-known, &quot;the Godfather of Soul. &quot; He is renowned for his shouting vocals, feverish dancing and unique rhythmic style. In the 1960s and 1970s, Brown was a presence in American political affairs, noted especially for his activism on behalf of African Americans and the poor. James Brown died early on 25 Dec 2006, having been admitted to hospital suffering from pneumonia. ", "The Fratellis": "The Fratellis are an alternative rock band from Glasgow, Scotland who took their name from the villains in the film &quot;The Goonies&quot; (although, by coincidence, Barry&#x27;s mother&#x27;s maiden name is in fact Fratelli).

The Fratellis EP was released April 3, 2006, featuring the tracks &quot;Creepin&#x27; Up The Backstairs&quot;, &quot;Stacie Anne&quot; and &quot;The Gutterati?&quot;. The NME ran a two page feature on The Fratellis in the August 10, 2006 issue, proclaiming them &quot;the best new band in Britain&quot;. &quot;Creepin&#x27; Up The Backstairs&quot; was never a single released by the band, even though a video was made for it. It was not eligible for the charts. The first single released by the band was &quot;Henrietta&quot;, which was released on June 12 2006 and charted at number 19 on the UK Charts. 2006-2007: Costello Music Costello Music was the The Fratellis debut album and was released September 11, 2006.

", "The Devil Wears Prada": "The Devil Wears Prada is an American metalcore band from Dayton, Ohio. Formed in 2005, they are currently signed to Warner Music Group. The Devil Wears Prada is a Christian band consisting of members Mike Hranica (vocals), Chris Rubey (lead guitar), Jeremy DePoyster (rhythm guitar, vocals), Andy Trick (bass), and Daniel Williams (drums), all of whom are Christians. To date, the group has released four full-length albums, one DVD, one EP, and seven music videos. The Devil Wears Prada was founded during 2005 in Dayton Ohio; they derived their band name from the story with the same title. Being founded with all Christian members and maintaining a theme that follows toward their religion, the group played their first show in 2005 with a fill-in bassist and only one guitarist. Rhythm guitarist Jeremy Depoyster and bassist Andy Trick joined the band soon afterward. They continued playing at local areas in Dayton before recording their demo later in the year which was titled Patterns of a Horizon. One year after the group recorded their demo and trialed for record labels, Rise Records took the band in with a contract. The band was unsatified with the demo so they re-recorded all the of the tracks from the demo for their debut full-length album, Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord. The album was recorded at The Foundation Recording Studio held in Connersville, Indiana and it was released on August 22, 2006. The record&#x27;s final track features guest vocals, courtesy of Cole Wallace who was formerly part of the band Gwen Stacy. With the release of the album, the band then began touring in multiple areas throughout the country, most notably at 2006&#x27;s Cornerstone Festival after being recognized as a newer key musical group to Christian metal. With Dear Love released at the end of the summer of 2006, The Devil Wears Prada already had songs for their second album prepared by winter of the same year. With a recording duration lasting from that time and leading into spring of 2007, the band&#x27;s second album, Plagues met its completion by the summer and was released on August 21, 2007. The demo version of their song \"HTML Rulez D00d\" was placed on the band&#x27;s Myspace profile on January 1, 2007 for promotion of the record and on July 11, AbsolutePunk began to stream their song &quot;Don&#x27;t Dink and Drance\", which led to further exposure for the band. The songs from the album &quot;HTML Rulez D00d&quot; and &quot;Hey John, What&#x27;s Your Name Again?\" were released as the album&#x27;s two singles, both of which spawned music videos that aired on television channels such as MTV and Fuse. Plagues peaked at #57 on the Billboard 200 on September 8, 2007 and has been considered a great success since its original release, selling more than 30,000 copies more than their debut album, Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord. It was re-released on October 28, 2008 in a digipakform that includes a DVD in which features the music videos for album&#x27;s two singles as well as footage of The Devil Wears Prada playing at 2008&#x27;s Warped Tour and Ultimatour. Later in the year, the band was interviewed by East Coast Romper, and stated that their primary influences are Underoath and Still Remains, which was mistaken on their official website due to it incorrectly stating that they were not influenced by these bands. The band recorded a cover of the rap song &quot;Still Fly&quot;, originally written and performed by Big Tymers, the cover song was released on the compilation album Punk Goes Crunk. The Devil Wears Prada began writing and recording their third album With Roots Above and Branches Below after attending 2008&#x27;s Warped Tour. Prior to recording and production of it, vocalist Mike Hranica stated &quot;Expect a much heavier and more epic record&quot;. Keyboardist, James Baney, also announced that their new album would be more mechanical but still containing their same distinct style whereas drummer, Daniel Williams, claimed that the new album would be &quot;crazier and wilder&quot; than their previous albums. In Autumn 2008, they debuted a song off of the upcoming record while on tour with Underoath, The Famine, Saosin, P. O. S, and Person L. The band launched their official website and released With Roots Above and Branches Below both on May 5, 2009. The sales of the album have been very satisfactory which brought it to position #11 on the Billboard 200 for top albums upon its release. The song &quot;Dez Moines&quot; was released as downloadable content for the video game Guitar Hero World Tour on May 7, as well as the song &quot;Hey John, What&#x27;s Your Name Again?&quot; was released as downloadable content for Rock Band and Rock Band 2 on June 30, 2009. As well as performing at the main stage of Warped Tour 2009, The Devil Wears Prada as well played at the iMatter Festival in Elmira, New York. On June 13, they performed the song \"Danger: Wildman for the first time in concert. Vocalist Mike Hranica, managed a clothing company called Shipshape Roolz Clothing in which he sponsored and endorsed bands. A fraction of Shipshape&#x27;s scale money was donated to charities such as Skate 4 Cancer. As of September 29, 2009 the clothing line was shut down and its online store changed its named to Traditiona, due to &quot;legal issues. &quot; From November 23 to December 21, 2009 the band toured with All That Remains and from February 4 to March 21, 2010 they were included on a tour headlined by Killswitch Engage and opened by Dark Tranquillity. At the beginning of 2010, it was announced that The Devil Wears Prada were voted as 2009&#x27;s Band of the Year by readers of Alternative Press and appeared on the cover. On February 12, 2010 the group confirmed the production for the &quot;Assistant to the Regional Manager&quot; music video, this led to its release on April 6, 2010 where it was premiered on Headbangers Ball. In an interview at the beginning of April with Lucy Alberts of Alternative Press, the band revealed that they were recording an EP before they begin their Back to the Roots Tour. The EP was described as a &quot;fun&quot; release with &quot;brutal&quot; songs in the vein of what will eventually become the band&#x27;s forthcoming studio album. The band&#x27;s Back to the Roots Tour was presented by Rockstar. Mike Hranica stated &quot;One of the primary elements of the Back to the Roots Tour is playing a few Dear Love songs that we have not played in a long time, and probably will not play again or anytime soon. &quot; On June 11 it was announced that they have completed the recording of the EP, the title for it was revealed as being Zombie EP and was released on August 24. After the completion and announcement of the EP, the band began their Back to the Roots Tour on the 25th of June as they planned. By January 2011, Hranica revealed in an interview with Tim Karan what the band&#x27;s ideas and plans for their fourth full-length studio album would be. His comments were placed within comparison to their latest release (the Zombie EP) and described that the record is &quot;a more heavy-focused sound from us. We think it would be smart to push that beefy, heavy songwriting into the new full-length&#8230;but with a strong blend of what we usually do with melody. &quot; The album was confirmed to not be a concept album - like their previous work on the Zombie EP - but would have an overall theme, focused on anti-idolatry, which, according to Hranica, &quot;has been weighing on me lately. &quot; On June 13, Alternative Press began streaming a track debuting off the upcoming album titled \"Born to Lose, and during the same month, the band signed with Roadrunner Records. Vocalist, Hrancia offered his opinion of the new material, stating that it will contain &quot;the heavy aspects of the Zombie EP, meshed with the melody of the full-lengths. 'Born to Lose' captures some of those elements and serves as a comprehensive preview to the album. &quot; He ended his comments with; &quot;By all means I&#x27;d call it our most emotional, well-written album to date. &quot; The album&#x27;s name was revealed to be Dead Throne, and was released on September 13, 2011 through Ferret Music. It has since become a critical and commercial success, where it peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, selling more than 32,000 copies within its first week. Dead Throne also topped the Christian and Independent album charts, as well as peaking at number 3 on the Rock and Hard Rock album charts. Discography 1. Dear Love: A Beautiful Discord (2006) 2.

The band's best known lineup is Kevin Shields (vocals, guitar), Bilinda Butcher (vocals, guitar), Debbie Googe (bass) and Colm O Ciosoig (drums). Their 1988 album Isn&#x27;t Anything is generally regarded as one of the most influential records of the period, acting as an important precursor to the early &#x27;90s &quot;shoegazing&quot; scene. In 1991, the band released their second full length album Loveless, later declared one of the finest albums of the 1990s. The band struggled to record a follow up album and split in 1997.

Their band shares its name with a low-budget Canadian slasher film. MBV influences include The Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth, Cocteau Twins, late-1970s Wire, The Jesus and Mary Chain, and independent artists such as The Pastels. Kevin Shields has also named The Beach Boys and The Ramones as a personal influence. After leaving Creation Records in 1992 and signing with Island Records, the band fell into a creative black hole. Rumors spread among their fans of albums being recorded and then shelved. Debbie Googe left the band to form Snowpony; she had not played bass on their recordings since You Made Me Realise. Colm O Ciosoig eventually left and formed a band with Hope Sandoval, formerly of Mazzy Star, called Hope Sandoval &amp; The Warm Inventions. Kevin Shields sporadically collaborated with other artists, most notably Experimental Audio Research, Curve, and Primal Scream. He revealed in a fall 2003 National Public Radio interview that Island Records quit financing his My Bloody Valentine endeavors after he spent half a million pounds of their money. As of 2006, many rumors mentioned the possible reformation of MBV for a new studio album, but none of these were true. On November 15 2007, My Bloody Valentine announced three upcoming live gigs in the UK for 2008. On June 13 and 14, the band played in public for the first time in thirteen years, offering a pair of &quot;Live Rehearsal&quot; presentations at the ICA in London and officially starting their series of comeback performances.

", "Forfun": "Forfun is a brazilian band, natural from Rio de Janeiro, and is formed by 4 young guys.

Their second album &#x27;Polisenso&#x27; represents a change in the band&#x27;s style, now leaning towards dub and reggae. ", "Creedence Clearwater Revival": "Creedence Clearwater Revival (sometimes shortened to Creedence or CCR) was an American rock band that gained popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s with a number of successful singles drawn from various albums. The band consisted of lead vocalist, lead guitarist, and primary songwriter John Fogerty, his brother and rhythm guitarist Tom Fogerty, bassist Stu Cook, and drummer Doug Clifford. Their musical style encompassed country rock and swamp rock genres; it remains a staple of radio airplay worldwide. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993 and were ranked at 82 on Rolling Stone&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest artists of all time. The band started out as The Blue Velvets, formed by John Fogerty, Doug Clifford, and Stu Cook in El Cerrito, California, United States in the late 1950s. They were an instrumental trio, however during the early &#x27;60s they began backing Tom Fogerty, John&#x27;s older brother, for school dances at El Cerrito High School, on fraternity house gigs and in the recording studio. By the mid 1960s, the band signed a contract with Fantasy Records which was a local label based in San Francisco at that time. They were attracted to the label because Fantasy had released a national hit by Vince Guaraldi, &quot;Cast Your Fate To The Wind&quot;. Fantasy officials changed the group&#x27;s name to The Golliwogs, an apparent reference to a once-popular minstrel doll called a Golliwogg. Seven singles were released in the San Francisco Bay area, but none received national attention (however, in 1975 Fantasy released Pre-Creedence, a compilation album of recordings by The Golliwogs). Eventually John Fogerty took control of the group, writing most of their material and singing lead vocals. The band&#x27;s first album as Creedence Clearwater Revival was released in 1968. A cover of the Dale Hawkins Swamp Rock classic &quot;Suzie Q. &quot; became their first hit single (the song was later featured in the movie Apocalypse Now). As a result, Creedence Clearwater Revival is considered part of that distinctly American Swamp Rock music, exemplified again most prominently in their song &quot;Born On The Bayou&quot;. By 1969, the band really began to find its voice; &quot;Proud Mary&quot; became their second hit single and also was a big hit for Ike and Tina Turner. It was followed by a series of successful songs, including &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, &quot;Green River&quot;, &quot;Down on the Corner&quot;, &quot;Travelin&#x27; Band&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain?&quot;, &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot;, &quot;Up Around the Bend&quot;, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, and &quot;Lookin&#x27; Out My Back Door. &quot; Due to John Fogerty&#x27;s success as writer, singer, and frontman, the other band members began to feel like they were being held back. His brother Tom left the band in 1971, to pursue an unsuccessful solo career. John Fogerty insisted that bassist Stu Cook and drummer Doug Clifford share equal songwriting and vocal time on the band&#x27;s final album Mardi Gras in 1972. Many have speculated that Fogerty did this in anticipation of poor sales, in order to prove to brother Tom (and the rest of world) that his songwriting had always been the real commercial talent behind the band&#x27;s success. The album did indeed receive poor reviews and sales, and the group disbanded shortly afterwards. John Fogerty bought himself out of his contract with Fantasy Records and eventually established a successful solo career. In 1990, Tom Fogerty died of AIDS, which he contracted from a blood transfusion. CCR was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993. At the induction, Tom Fogerty&#x27;s widow brought the urn containing his ashes for a CCR &quot;reunion,&quot; but John Fogerty would not perform with his fellow bandmates. Band members Doug Clifford and Stu Cook formed a band in 1995 with other musicians called Creedence Clearwater Revisited. They perform globally, only performing the original band&#x27;s classics. John Fogerty still has no communications with Cook and Clifford. Creedence Clearwater Revival was somewhat unfashionable during the time they were active, because they concentrated on tightly-focused, well-crafted singles rather than long, loose album cuts. However within a few years of their breakup their legacy became secure as one of the great American rock bands, and they heavily influenced the entire genre of heartland rock. Fogerty&#x27;s songs are considered classics of the rock form and have been covered by countless artists; &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; in particular is revived whenever America goes to war. A new live version of &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; by John Fogerty was recently released as part of his 2005 compilation album The Long Road Home which combines both his Creedence and solo hits. &quot;The guitar solos on such songs as &quot;Suzie Q&quot;, &quot;Heard it Through the Grapevine&quot; and &quot;I Put A Spell On You&quot; are believed to be played by Steve Cropper of Booker T &amp; the MGs. &quot; This assertion seems to be a strange entry by an unknown commentator, it seems unlikely indeed considering the obvious prowess of John Fogerty as a Guitar player, his subsequent solo playing on &quot;I Heard It Through The Grapevine&quot;, &quot;Gloomy&quot;, &quot;The WorkingMan&quot; and many others. John recently (2008) released a new album entitled Revival receiving a Grammy nomination.  CCR holds the record for the group with the most # 2 songs on the U. S. Charts yet amazingly they never had a # 1 hit. ", "Slaves": "Slaves refers to more than one artist: 1) Slaves are a two piece lo-fi garage band from Kent, signed to the Virgin EMI label.

Mays has left the band voluntarily because of family health issues and will not be returning. No permanent replacement has been found as of yet. 3) Slaves was the original name of Pleasure Forever formed by Joshua Hughes (Guitars), Andrew Rothbard (Vocals / Piano / Keyboards) and David Clifford (Drums/ Percussion). Their music is generally dark, and has a somewhat gothic/cabaret feel. Lyrical content (while heavily distorted on Alter) can be vague but is usually concerned with images of hedonism, lust, weakness of man, death and similar themes. Piano, keyboard and synthesizer are very dominant in their sound as well as very fuzzy, soft guitar sounds. With the exception of Sonny Kay, Slaves/Pleasure Forever features all the members of The VSS. ", "ffs": "FFS (Franz Ferdinand and Sparks) is a supergroup formed by Glaswegian indie rock band Franz Ferdinand and American rock band Sparks. Their formation was announced on March 9, 2015, but the two bands had been recording since at least the mid-2000s. The group&#x27;s eponymous debut studio album was released in the U.

", "Rihanna": "Robyn Rihanna Fenty (born February 20, 1988), known by her stage name, Rihanna, is a Bajan singer. Her song Umbrella was one of the highest-selling songs of 2007 and her 3rd album Good Girl Gone Bad was critically acclaimed, helping propel her to superstar status. She has attained thirteen Billboard Hot 100 number ones thus far and is the second Bajan artist to win a Grammy Award. She is also a cultural ambassador for Barbados. Rihanna was born in Saint Michael, Barbados to Ronald Fenty, a warehouse supervisor, and Monica Fenty, an accountant. Her mother, a native of Guyana, is Afro-Guyanese and her father is Bajan and Irish. She is the oldest of three siblings; two younger brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty. She began singing at around the age of seven. Her childhood was deeply affected by her father&#x27;s addiction to crack cocaine and parent&#x27;s rocky marriage, which ended when she was fourteen years old. Rihanna attended Charles F. Broome Memorial School, a primary school in Barbados, and then the Combermere School, where she formed a musical trio with two of her classmates at the age of fifteen. In 2004 she won the Miss Combermere Beauty Pageant. She was an army cadet in a sub-military programme that trained with the military of Barbados and Shontelle was her drill sergeant. At the age of 15, she formed a girl group with two of her classmates. In 2003, friends introduced Rihanna and her two bandmates to record producer Evan Rogers, who was vacationing in Barbados with his wife. The group auditioned for Rogers, who said that &quot;the minute Rihanna walked into the room, it was like the other two girls didn&#x27;t exist. &quot; While auditioning for Rogers, Rihanna sang Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s cover of &quot;Emotion&quot;. Over the next year, Rihanna and her mom shuttled back and forth to Rogers home in Stamford, Connecticut. Then, shortly after turning 16, she relocated in the United States and moved in with Rogers and his wife. Carl Sturken helped Rihanna record a four-song demo, which included the ballad &quot;The Last Time,&quot; a cover of Whitney Houston's hit &quot;For the Love of You&quot; and what would become her first hit, &quot;Pon de Replay&quot; to send to various recording companies. It took a year to record the demos, because she was going to school and would only record during summer and Christmas school breaks. Rihanna&#x27;s demo made its way to Def Jam, which invited her to audition for the label&#x27;s then-president, Jay-Z, who quickly signed her. Rihanna broke into the recording industry in 2005 with the release of her debut album Music of the Sun, which features the number 2 hit single &quot;Pon de Replay&quot;. Less than a year later, Rihanna released A Girl Like Me and earned her first number-one single, &quot;SOS, which sampled the popular 80s track &quot;Tainted Love&quot;. &quot;Unfaithful&quot; was also released and was fairly successful. Rihanna released her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad, in June 2007. Prior to the release of the album, she spent the week of the Grammys writing songs for the album with Ne-Yo. She adopted a more sexual image while recording the album, eventually dying her hair black and cutting it short. Rihanna worked with Timbaland and Christopher &quot;Tricky&quot; Stewart, as well as previous musical collaborators such as Stargate, Carl Sturken and Evan Rogers to re-imagine her album compositions with uptempo dance tracks. Rihanna commented, &quot;I want to keep people dancing but still be soulful at the same time. You feel different every album, and this stage I feel like I want to do a lot of uptempo . &quot; The album topped the charts in countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia and Ireland, and peaked at number two in the United States and Australia. Unlike previous work, the album featured a more dance-pop sound instead of the dancehall, reggae and ballad styles. The album received positive reviews by critics, becoming her most critically acclaimed album at that time compared to her previous efforts. It yielded eight hit singles - &quot;Umbrella&quot; &quot;Shut Up and Drive&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Music&quot; &quot;Hate That I Love You&quot; &quot;Rehab&quot; &quot;Disturbia&quot; &quot;Take A Bow&quot; &quot; If I Never See Your Face Again &quot; - all singles reaching the top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 -- including the worldwide number-one hit &quot;Umbrella,&quot; featuring Jay-Z. In addition to reaching number one in various countries, &quot;Umbrella&quot; was the number one single in the United Kingdom for ten consecutive weeks, making it the longest-running number-one single since Wet Wet Wet&#x27;s single &quot;Love Is All Around&quot; spent fifteen weeks at the top in 1994. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007 published by Rolling Stone magazine. In 2008, &quot;Umbrella&quot; earned Rihanna and Jay-Z a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration in addition to receiving nominations for Record of the Year and Song of the Year. It managed to stay at number one in the United Kingdom for 10 weeks, the longest time spent by a female and in the 21st century, on this chart. &quot;Umbrella&quot; has also been recognised in various forms of accolades by the music press. The song is listed number three on the 100 Best Songs of 2007, published by the music magazine Rolling Stone. Time magazine also listed the song number three on their Top 10 Songs of 2007. The song is listed number one on Entertainment Weekly magazine&#x27;s list of the 10 Best Singles of 2007, while topping the magazine&#x27;s poll for the best single of 2007. Blender magazine awarded the song Song of the Year in their Readers&#x27; Poll 2007. The music press has considered &quot;Umbrella&quot; as 2007&#x27;s Song of the Summer, while The New York Times writer Kelefa Sanneh regarded it as &quot;arguably 2007&#x27;s signature slow jam&quot;. In August 2009, Rihanna collaborated with Jay-Z and Kanye West on &quot; Run This Town . &quot; The song peaked at number two on Billboard Hot 100 and also reached the top ten in five other countries. She appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia for the September 2009 Issue. The shoot was influenced by Rihanna&#x27;s hair, which she had cut for the shoot into a mohawk-like style. The style of the shoot was Extreme Couture and very dark, and in one shot she appeared semi-nude. Rihanna performed &quot; Run This Town &quot; along with Jay-Z and West for the &quot;Answer the Call&quot; concert at Madison Square Garden in September 2009, making it her first musical performance since the altercation with Brown. The trio also performed &quot; Run This Town ,&quot; on the premiere of The Jay Leno Show on September 14, 2009. In November of 2009, &quot;Rated R&quot; was released in the wake of a physical altercation with romantic interest Chris Brown, who pled guilty to felony assault. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; &ndash; written with Ne-Yo - was one of the year&#x27;s most controversial singles. The album also includes collaborations with Tricky, The-Dream, Stargate, and SRP. One year later, Rihanna released her fifth studio album called &quot;Loud&#x27;. It&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Only Girl (In the World)&quot;, reached number one in more than ten countries. The song also won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording. &quot;Talk That Talk&quot; was released one year after &quot;Loud&quot;. With the song &quot; We Found Love &quot;, Rihanna became the fastest solo artist in the chart&#x27;s history to achieve twenty Hot 100 top-ten singles, breaking the previous record set by Madonna. The song later became her eleventh number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;You Da One&quot; became the second single from the album but was not as successful as &quot; We Found Love &quot;. The third single from the album, &quot;Talk That Talk&quot; featuring Jay-Z, was announced on Rihanna&#x27;s Twitter. The fourth single, &quot;Where Have You Been&quot;, peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. On February 20, 2012, Rihanna and Chris Brown released 2 remixes, one featuring the &quot;Talk That Talk&quot; album track &quot;Birthday Cake&quot; and the other featuring Chris Brown&#x27;s &quot;Turn Up The Music&quot; In April 2012, the singer appeared in the movie &quot;Battleship&quot;, which is based on the game of the same name. Rihanna&#x27;s seventh album, Unapologetic was released on November 19, 2012; it was preceded by the lead single Diamonds, which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 becoming Rihanna&#x27;s twelfth number one single on the chart and tying her with Madonna and The Supremes for the fourth-most number ones in the chart&#x27;s history. Rihanna has been working on her, currently untitled, eighth studio album since 2014. The first single from her upcoming album FourFiveSeconds was released on January 24, 2015. The second single Bitch Better Have My Money debuted on Tidal on April 5, 2015. ", "American Football": "American Football are an American emo/indie rock band from Urbana, Illinois, originally active from 1997 to 2000. The band was formed by guitarist and singer Mike Kinsella (formerly of Cap&#x27;n Jazz, The One Up Downstairs, Joan of Arc, Owls and currently of Owen) and drummer Steve Lamos (formerly of The One Up Downstairs and currently of The Geese), and also included guitar player Steve Holmes. The band had few live performances and disbanded less than a year after releasing their self-titled album; still, they gained critical acclaim for that album, which merged the plain-spoken, confessional lyrics of emo and the varying time signatures of math rock with a softer musical sensibility. Mike Kinsella explained the band&#x27;s name thus: &quot;My girlfriend had been in Dublin, Ireland visiting her family. One of the things she brought home for me was a flyer for a Chicago Bears exhibition game that said: &quot;Come see American Football, featuring the most overpaid athletes in the world. &quot; Something about that statement made me think of rock bands, most of whom are the most overpaid musicians in the world. When I suggested it as a name, the other guys thought it was dumb. Still, for whatever reason, we kept it&quot;. The band regrouped in 2014 for two shows to promote the re-issue of their self-titled album. ", "Blur": "Blur is an alternative rock band which formed in Colchester, England in 1989. The band consists of Damon Albarn (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Graham Coxon (guitar, vocals), Alex James (bass) and Dave Rowntree (drums). Blur&#x27;s debut album Leisure (1991) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and Shoegazing and spawned their first UK Top 10 single, There&#x27;s No Other Way. Following a stylistic change in 1992 (influenced by English guitar groups such as The Kinks, The Beatles, The Animals and XTC) Blur released &quot;Popscene&quot; as a stand alone single, this was a commercial flop, but was widely considered to be a crucial turning point for the band&#x27;s style. Following this, Blur released 3 studio albums in a similar style: Modern Life Is Rubbish (1993), Parklife (1994) and The Great Escape (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a famous chart battle with rival band Oasis dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;. By the late 1990s, with the release of Blur (1997), the band underwent another reinvention, influenced by the lo-fi style of American indie rock bands such as Pavement; in the process, Blur finally gained mainstream success in the US with the single, &quot;Song 2&quot;. The last album featuring the band&#x27;s original lineup, 13 (1999) found Blur experimenting with electronic music and gospel music, as Albarn wrote more personal lyrics. In May 2002, Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album Think Tank (2003). Containing electronic sounds and simpler guitar playing, the album was marked by Albarn&#x27;s growing interest in hip-hop and African music. In December 2008, Blur announced that they would be reforming for the first time since their hiatus in 2003, complete with Graham Coxon, for a UK Tour in 2009. Blur headlined the Oxegen Festival in Ireland, Glastonbury and the T in the Park Festival in the UK, as well as Dates in London, Manchester, Newcastle, Southend and Wolverhampton. The band continues to be sporadically active, releasing the single &quot;Fool&#x27;s Day&quot; and the documentary &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot; in 2010, and performing several concerts in 2012. Two new songs, &quot;Under the Westway&quot; and &quot;The Puritan&quot;, were released in 2012 leading up to a post-Olympics concert which also features New Order, The Specials and Bombay Bicycle Club. In 2015, Blur released The Magic Whip. ", "Elvis Presley": "Elvis Aaron Presley (Tupelo, Mississippi, January 8, 1935 - Memphis, Tennessee, August 16, 1977), was an American singer, song producer and actor. A cultural icon, he is widely known by the single name Elvis. Elvis Presley began his music career at Sun Records in the spring of 1954 when Sam Philips recorded Elvis performing several of Elvis&#x27; favorite songs with Scotty Moore (guitar) and Bill Black (bass). One of these covers was a country and western song, &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot;. Elvis is the best-selling solo artist of all time in the United States with confirmed 189. 2 million records in RIAA shipments. Before Sam Philips sold Elvis&#x27; contract to RCA Victor in 1956 for $35,000 they had recorded six two-sided singles. Each of these recordings featured a country and western song on one side and a rhythm and blues song on the other. One of the reasons Elvis was so popular was because of his ability to merge attributes of what was perceived to be &quot;white&quot; (C&amp;W) and &quot;black&quot; (R&amp;B) music. An example of this is evident in Elvis&#x27; hit song &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; which reached #1 not only in the Pop charts, but the R&amp;B and C&amp;W charts as well. This was the first time that a single song held the #1 spot in all three charts. Elvis remains a popular and enigmatic star. His legend has only grown stronger since his death. In fact, there is a widespread belief that Elvis--who was known by his first name--did not die in 1977. Many fans persist in claiming he is still alive, that he went into hiding for various reasons. This claim is allegedly backed up by thousands of so-called Elvis sightings that have occurred in the years since his death, and by the fact that his middle name Aron was misspelled Aaron, with two As, on his tombstone. During an active recording career that spanned more than two decades, Presley set and broke many records for both concert attendance and sales. Some of those records have since been matched and/or broken by other artists, but some of his records will probably remain unbroken and/or unmatched forever. He has had more than 120 singles in the US top 40, across various musical genres, with over 20 reaching number one. Elvis Aaron (sometimes spelled Aron) Presley, in the humblest of circumstances, was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Biography: Elvis&#x27; musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&amp;B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, he began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture. He starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards for 150 different albums and singles, far more than any other artist. Among his many awards and accolades were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges his celebrity status might have afforded him, he honorably served his country in the U. S. Army. His talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Health problems, drug dependency and other factors are said to have led to his premature death at age 42 at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977. ", "Beirut": "Beirut is an American indie-rock and world music band which was originally the solo musical project of Zach Condon (born Zachary Francis Condon in Santa Fe, New Mexico) and later expanded into a band. The band&#x27;s first performances were in New York, in May 2006, to support the release of their debut album, Gulag Orkestar. Condon recorded before Beirut was established: when he was fifteen and under the name of Realpeople, he made an electronic record, fashioned after his love for The Magnetic Fields. Condon was a straight-A student until he dropped out at the age of 17 to travel Europe with his cousin in a drunken haze, cavorting and partying with the locals wherever he ended up. It was during one of these evenings that he was first exposed to Balkan music (notably including the Boban Markovic Orkestar and Goran Bregovic), blasting from the upstairs apartment. Condon ended up with the Serbian artists all night, going through albums country by country, note for note. The first album under the Beirut moniker, Gulag Orkestar (2006), was the direct result of what he learned that night. While it may sound like an entire Balkan orchestra playing modern songs as mournful ballads and upbeat marches, the album was performed and recorded almost entirely by Condon alone. He did so on Pro Tools while skipping school in Albuquerque and at Sea Side Studios in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Jeremy Barnes added percussion and some violin overlays. After recording, Condon formed a full band which at times varies in the number of members, from six to ten. Live he is accompanied by Perrin Cloutier (cello/accordion), Jason Poranski (guitar/mandolin/ukulele), Nick Petree (drums), Kristin Ferebee (violin), Paul Collins (organ/keys/tambourine/ukulele), Jon Natchez (baritone sax/mandolin/glockenspiel), and Kelly Pratt (trumpet/euphonium). In November 2006 Condon was &quot;briefly hospitalized for extreme exhaustion&quot;, the band&#x27;s website said, and as a consequence the band cancelled the rest of the tour. They resumed performing in March 2007 and released their second album, The Flying Club Cup the same year on October 9th. Parts of the album were performed and recorded by Condon in his bedroom again, but others were recorded with the live band, which resulted in a more organic, live sound. While writing, Condon said he was inspired by French music, like Jacques Brel (whose song Le Moribond he covered on his Elephant Gun EP), and he moved to Paris for a while. During the extensive tour in support of The Flying Club Cup, Condon and the band more or less fell apart from exhaustion once again and disappeared from the radar in April 2008. Condon took a long break and returned in 2009 with a double EP, March of the Zapotec &amp; Realpeople: Holland. The first was partly recorded in Mexico with the Mexican Band Jimenez and had a more South-American flavour to it than Condon&#x27;s previous efforts. The second EP &#x27;Holland&#x27; was credited to Condon&#x27;s old name Realpeople and consisted of five electrotracks, once more in the vein of The Magnetic Fields. The band&#x27;s album &quot;The Rip Tide&quot; was released in 2011.

Since its formation, the band&#x27;s line-up had included Dexter Holland (lead vocals, guitar), Noodles (lead and rhythm guitars, back vocals), Greg K. (bass, back vocals), and Ron Welty (drums, percussion), who left in 2003. Their current drummer is Pete Parada, formerly of Face to Face and Saves the Day, who has been with the band since 2007. Along with fellow California punk bands Green Day and Rancid, The Offspring have been credited with reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States during the mid-1990s. To date, The Offspring has released eight studio albums, one compilation, four EPs and three DVDs. They have sold over 34 million albums worldwide, making them one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time. Each album since the release of their 1994 album Smash has sold over a million units. Since the release of Smash, which is the best-selling independent label album of all time, The Offspring has achieved commercial success over five albums, with singles such as &quot;Come Out and Play&quot;, and &quot;Self Esteem&quot;. The band's next three albums, Ixnay on the Hombre, Americana and Conspiracy of One, were also successful, with Ixnay on the Hombre and Conspiracy of One reaching platinum certification, and Americana achieving multi-platinum status. Longtime drummer Ron Welty left The Offspring in early 2003, and was replaced by Atom Willard. Later that year, the band released their next album, Splinter, to moderate sales and fairly warm reviews. In 2005, The Offspring released a greatest hits album and toured in support of the compilation. Their eighth studio album, Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace, was released on June 17, 2008 with the hit singles &quot;You're Gonna Go Far, Kid&quot; and &quot;Hammerhead. &quot; Days Go By is the band's ninth studio album and is due to be released on June 26, 2012.

The band&#x27;s most recent two albums have received critical acclaim from magazines Rock Sound and Exclaim!. They were released through Victory Records. Counterparts formed in Hamilton, Ontario in 2007, under the name &quot;Brigade&quot;, later &quot;Sharia&quot; before settling on Counterparts. Counterparts consisted of vocalist Brendan Murphy, guitarist Jesse Doreen, guitarist Curtis Washik, bassist Eric Bazinet, and drummer Ryan Juntilla. In mid-2009, Washik departed from the band, and Alex Re joined the band temporarily as their guitarist before becoming their permanent guitarist. In March 2009 Counterparts toured Canada. In 2010 Shane Told, from the band Silverstein, signed them to his Verona Records label.

A split EP, featuring Needham on drums was released 21 November 2010 with hardcore punk band Exalt. The band toured North America in support of the album. In spring of 2011, the band was signed to Victory Records. The band continued to tour until the summer of 2011, when they announced that they were recording a new album. During this time, Needham left the band to see a speech therapist. A search for their next drummer was started, but ultimately, Juntilla rejoined the band, just in time to start recording for their second album, The Current Will Carry Us. Album was released October 24, 2011 on Victory. A music video was released for the song &quot;Jumping Ship&quot;. The bands latest album, entitled The Difference Between Hell and Home was released on July 24, 2013 to positive critical reception.

In the Fall of 2013, guitarist Alex Re posted on his personal Facebook page that he had left Counterparts and will be playing his last show with the band at their hometown show in December. In the meantime, the band was able to get Adrian Lee to fill-in for Re on their last few tours of 2013. It is unknown if Lee is a permanent replacement for Re. In the spring of 2014, bassist Eric Bazinet announced that after seven years, he was leaving the band due to pursue a career and to spend time with family.

He started his career in the early 1970s as a singer in spit &#x27;n&#x27; sawdust bars. Initially, he was deeply influenced by the beat generation, novelists like Jack Kerouac and William S. Burroughs, and poets like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski. Waits is often compared to Charles Bukowski, being similar both in content and lifestyle, although Waits&#x27;s views are more egalitarian than Bukowski&#x27;s. Waits was unable to make a living from his music in the 70s because his classical bar music, based in pre-rock, and Americana, blues, and Vaudeville styles were not popular. Waits&#x27;s voice back then was soft, warm and clear. Waits subsequently developed a devoted cult following and has influenced subsequent songwriters, despite having little radio or music video support. In fact, his songs are perhaps best known to the general public in the form of cover versions of more visible artists, such as the Eagles, Bruce Springsteen and Rod Stewart. Although Waits's albums have met with mixed commercial success in his native United States, they have occasionally achieved gold album sales status in other countries. Lyrically, Waits&#x27;s songs are known for atmospheric portrayals of seedy characters and places; he sings about the losers on the streets: alcoholics, junkies, prostitutes and social outcasts, although he also includes more conventional and touching ballads in his repertoire. While opening for Frank Zappa, the audience catcalled and refused to listen to him; he was an unsuitable match with Zappa&#x27;s avantgarde style. Countless cigarettes, gallons of alcohol and many all night parties eventually left their trace in his face and voice. His more recent gravelly voice can be first heard on Small Change. This distinctive voice turned out to be his trademark. It is described by the Music Hound Rock Album Guide as sounding &quot;like it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months and then taken outside and run over with a car&quot;. Small Change with its sentimental ballads, its bar-jazz attitude and Film Noir-oriented stories turned out to be his biggest commercial success in the 1970s. Waits subsequently developed a more unique style. His songs have grown more abrasive since then, and the arrangements have turned more surreal and experimental with every new record. His life brings him to new visions, as indicated by the direction taken in his &quot;Alice&quot; release. While composing the soundtrack for Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s One From The Heart Waits met Kathleen Brennan, his bride-to-be. They married in 1980 and she helped him quit drinking and smoking. Since their marriage they have been working together on his albums as co-producers and co-writers. It is hard to say which part belongs to her and which to him, but it&#x27;s easy to see that they make a perfect team. Additionally, his eldest son Casey can be heard on turntables and percussion on Waits&#x27;s album &quot;Real Gone&quot;. One of Waits&#x27;s greatest successes was the album &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, released in 1983. It struck with his critics and fans alike. He achieved a new level of song writing and left former conventions (and his earlier career) behind. All songs, whether ballads, jive or jazz are played in a completely different way. It seems that Waits had taken the musical archetypes of these styles and made them his own. All tracks are in the quintessential Waits style. They have a striking rawness and listenability and they set the stage for his success and his future career. The Bad As Me Songfacts reports that 36 years after the release of Waits&#x27; first album, Closing Time in 1973, Bad As Me became Waits&#x27;s first ever top 10 album in the US when it debuted at #6 with 63,000 sales. In the late 1980s Waits discovered an outlet for his creativity in composing musicals. His first Musical was named &quot;The Black Rider&quot;, and is based on &quot;Der Freischutz&quot; by Carl Maria von Weber. It was co-produced by Robert Wilson and the lyrics come from William S. Burroughs. The story is slightly reminiscent of Kurt Weil&#x27;s and Berthold Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Three Penny Opera&quot; and the 1930s. The debut performance of the play was in 1990 at the Thalia Theater, Hamburg and has been played by various theatre groups since then. Waits was also responsible for two other musicals, which later became albums released simultaneously in 2002. One was the musical &quot;Blood Money,&quot; which covers the &quot;Woyczek&quot; theme of Georg Buchner. This one is one of the darkest works from Waits. The other musical is based on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s classic children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. &quot;Alice&quot; is very romantic, dreamy and soft, and contains one of Waits most romantic songs. Even though they were released at the same time, the bootlegs of the &quot;Alice&quot; musical were long before traded between fans and were just rearranged and re-mastered for the official release. Besides many film contributions as composer - the Internet Movie Database imdb. com lists 47 appearances of Waits as composer and 38 soundtracks containing songs by Waits - he also is an actor with a total of 25 appearances, ranging from some mini-roles as a trumpeter in &quot;Heart of Saturday Night&quot; and the R. M. Renfield in &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot; to the major role of Zack in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Down by Law&quot;. He recently appeared in Roberto Benigni&#x27;s &quot;The Tiger and the Snow&quot;, playing You Can Never Hold Back Spring at Benigni&#x27;s wedding dream. Even more recently, Waits played Mr. Nick (the Devil) in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s &quot;The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnussuss&quot;. In addition to a number of concert videos, he also appeared in the critically-acclaimed concert feature film &quot;Big Time&quot; (1990). Waits has always refused to allow the use of his songs in commercials. He has filed several lawsuits against advertisers for using his material without permission. Waits also successfully sued an advertiser for using a work that was stylistically similar to his work, after he had declined to sell them the rights to his song. He has been quoted as saying, &quot;Apparently the highest compliment our culture grants artists nowadays is to be in an ad -- ideally naked and purring on the hood of a new car. I have adamantly and repeatedly refused this dubious honor. &quot; Here is an archive of some of Tom&#x27;s best quotes: http://www. intercom. net/local/shore_journal/yas11015. html", "Beck": "The Artist name Beck can refer to two artists; 1) Beck Hansen (born Bek David Campbell, July 8, 1970) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist. Beck&#x27;s music is known for its pop-junk culture collage of musical styles, ironic lyrics, samples, drum machines, live instrumentation and heady sound effects. Beck was born in Los Angeles, California, to David Campbell (a musician and son of a Presbyterian minister) and Bibbe Hansen (a former dancer for The Velvet Underground, founding member of the satirical band Black Fag, and visual artist). When his parents separated, Beck stayed with his mother and brother in Los Angeles, where he was influenced by that city&#x27;s diverse musical offerings--everything from hip-hop to latin music--and his mother&#x27;s art scene - all of which would later reappear in his recorded and published work. Although Beck&#x27;s work defies easy description, his eclecticism and genre experiments have sparked comparisons with Prince, though Beck was undoubtedly a less prolific artist, and drew on an absurdist, free-flowing lyrical style totally original when first exposed to mainstream audiences (indeed, some critics labeled him and his breakthrough single Loser as novelties - see below). Despite this individualism, Beck&#x27;s music was very much a product of the 90s and the media age in general, with hip hop, indie/underground rock, electronic music and genre-benders like the Beastie Boys as notable touchstones; in addition, some critics could not resist likening his head-spinning lyrical aesthetic to a post-modern Bob Dylan sensibility. After dropping out of high school in the mid-1980s, Beck educated himself and traveled widely. In Germany, he spent time with his grandfather, fluxus artist Al Hansen. His artistic relationship with his grandfather may have influenced both his album art and sense of musical collage. He began the musical activity in 1988. The late-80&#x27;s found him in New York City as part of the punk-influenced anti-folk music movement. Beck returned to Los Angeles at the turn of the decade, destitute but motivated. During this time, Beck sought out (or snuck onto) stages at venues all over Los Angeles, from punk clubs to coffee shops. Some of his earliest and most thought-provoking recordings were achieved by working with Tom Grimley at Poop Alley Studios, a part of WIN Records. In this atmosphere of heady creativity the founders of Bong Load Custom Records discovered Beck. Their 1993 12&quot; vinyl Loser, from an initial run of 530 copies, created a sensation on college and alternative radio that led to a furious bidding war between labels to sign Beck. Eventually, he chose Geffen Records, who offered him terms that included an allowance for the release of independent albums while under contract (he may have owed Bong Load another album or two). In 1994, Geffen&#x27;s official debut release of Mellow Gold made Beck a mainstream smash success; it also led to his iconic status as the &quot;slacker&quot; representative of the alternative rock scene, although the title of the song had been ironic. At the same time, he released Stereopathetic Soulmanure on Flipside Records and One Foot in the Grave on independent K Records. Beck took his act on the road with the 1995 Lollapalooza tour. Still, some critics panned him as a one-hit wonder. Audiences&#x27; (especially at Lollapalooza) familiarity with Loser only, and their general disinterest in his other work only reinforced his image as a one-hit wonder. It&#x27;s been said said that Beck released Stereopathetic Soulmanure and One Foot in the Grave to shake the Gen X-ers that associated themselves with him and made &quot;Loser&quot; their slacker anthem. The one-hit wonder label was put to rest with the release of 1996&#x27;s Odelay, a collaborative effort with The Dust Brothers, producers of Paul&#x27;s Boutique. The lead single, &quot;Where It&#x27;s At&quot;, received heavy airplay and its video was in constant rotation on MTV. Within the year, Odelay had received perfect reviews in Rolling Stone and Spin magazines, having been listed on countless &quot;Best of&quot; lists (it topped the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for &#x27;Album of the Year&#x27;), receiving double-platinum status, and earning an impressive number of industry awards, including two Grammys. Odelay was followed in 1998 by Mutations. Produced by Nigel Godrich of Radiohead fame, it was intended as a stopgap measure before the next album proper. Recorded over two weeks, during which Beck recorded one song a day, the sessions produced 14 songs. Mutations was a departure from the electronic density of Odelay, and was filled with folk and blues influences. Songs on the album consisted of older tracks, some even dating back as far as 1994. In 1999, Geffen released the much-anticipated Midnite Vultures, an orgy of sexual and culinary innuendo supported by a world tour. For Beck, it was a return to the high-energy performances that had been his trademark as far back as Lollapalooza. After Midnite Vultures came Sea Change in 2002, another airy and emotional album with producer Nigel Godrich, which became Beck&#x27;s first U. S. Top 10 album, reaching # 8. Sea Change was conceptualized as an album with one unifying theme--the stages following the end of a relationship. The album also featured string arrangements by Beck&#x27;s father and a sonically dense mix reminiscient of Mutations. The Sea Change tour featured The Flaming Lips as Beck&#x27;s opening and backing band. In September 2003, Beck returned to the studio to work on his sixth major-label album. Guero was produced by the Dust Brothers and Tony Hoffer and features a collaboration with Jack White of The White Stripes; it marked a return to Odelay-era sound. The album was released in March of 2005 and despite critical acclaim, the album received a more lackluster response from Beck&#x27;s indie-oriented fanbase. Beck married Marissa Ribisi in April 2004, shortly before the birth of their son, Cosimo Henri Hansen. 2004 also saw the release of &quot;10 Years of Mellow Gold,&quot; a short documentary about Beck&#x27;s first album. Beck&#x27;s next album, The Information was released on October 3, 2006. It is a largely electronic and ambient, filled with blips and beeps. It was produced by Nigel Godrich, who worked on &quot;Sea Change&quot; and a longtime Radiohead and Thom Yorke producer. The first single was Nausea, an acoustic rock hip hop song. The next single was Cellphone&#x27;s Dead, and the third single was Think I&#x27;m In Love. His next single, Timebomb, was released on iTunes on August 21, 2007, and the limited edition vinyl 12&quot; was released on November 2, 2007, with an instrumental version of the song on the B-side. In December, 2007, it was announced that Timebomb had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. Modern Guilt was the eighth studio album by Beck. It was released on July 8, 2008. The album fulfilled Beck&#x27;s recording contract with Interscope Records. Outside of North America, the record was released by XL Recordings. Its three singles were Chemtrails, Gamma Ray, and Youthless. Modern Guilt features two contributions by Cat Power and was produced by Beck and Danger Mouse. The album entered both the Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart at number four, and gave Beck his first ever Top 10 placing on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at number nine. The album has also been Beck&#x27;s best charting album in Australia, reaching 13. It sold 84,000 copies in its first week. Although successful, this does not match the first week sales of The Information, which were 99,000. In December 2008, Modern Guilt was nominated for Best Alternative Album at the 51st Grammy Awards. Song Reader, a project Beck released in December 2012, is 20 songs presented only as sheet music, in the hopes that enterprising musicians will record their own versions. The idea of Song Reader came about nearly fifteen years prior, shortly after the release of Odelay. When sent a book of transcribed sheet music for that album, Beck decided to play through it and grew interested in the world before recorded sound. He aimed to keep the arrangements as open as possible, to re-create the simplicity of the standards, and became preoccupied with creating only pieces that could fit within the Great American Songbook. In 2013 Beck began playing special Song Reader concerts with a variety of guests and announced he was working on a record of Song Reader material with other musicians as well as possibly a compilation of fan versions. In the summer of 2013, Beck was reported to be working on two new studio albums: one a more self-contained acoustic disc in the vein of One Foot in the Grave and another described as a &quot;proper follow-up&quot; to Modern Guilt. Beck expects to release both albums independently. He released two standalone singles over the course of the summer: the electro ballad Defriended and the chorus-heavy I Won&#x27;t Be Long. A third single, Gimme, appeared on September 17. In October 2013, it was announced that Beck signed to Capitol Records. Beck released his twelfth studio album entitled Morning Phase on 21 February 2014. For the recording of Morning Phase, Beck reunited with many of the same musicians with whom he had worked on the critically acclaimed 2002 album Sea Change. On January 20, 2014, the album&#x27;s first single Blue Moon was released. Beck released the second single, Waking Light, on February 4, 2014 2) BECK can refer to a fictional rock band from the Japanese Anime series BECK: Mongolian Chop Squad. The fictional BECK&#x27;s songs feature in the BECK Original Sound Track. BECK&#x27;s style and members are highly influenced by various different artists. From vocals in the style of Zack De La Rocha from Rage Against the Machine, guitar influenced by Tom Morello of the same band, the band is highly influenced by rap-rock. As the series develops, other influence appear, including guitar in the style of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Jimmy Page, and Red Hot Chili Peppers John Frusciante. During the series, the band covers a famous The Beatles song, &#x27;I&#x27;ve got a Feeling&#x27;. The name BECK could have possibly been influenced by the first artist Beck, mentioned above. Harold Sakushi, the original author of the series, has confirmed that BECK is generally based around the Red Hot Chili Peppers, being his favourite band. ", "Green Day": "Green Day is an American punk rock band formed in 1987. The band consists of lead vocalist and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong, bassist and backing vocalist Mike Dirnt, drummer Tre Cool and guitarist and backing vocalist Jason White, who became a full member after playing in the band as a session and touring guitarist for 13 years. Cool replaced former drummer John Kiffmeyer in 1990, prior to the recording of the band&#x27;s second studio album, Kerplunk (1992). Green Day was originally part of the punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club in Berkeley, California. The band&#x27;s early releases were from the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, its major label debut Dookie released through Reprise Records became a breakout success and eventually sold over 10 million copies in the U. S. Green Day was widely credited, alongside fellow California punk bands Sublime, Bad Religion, The Offspring and Rancid, with popularizing and reviving mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States. Green Day&#x27;s three follow-up albums, Insomniac (1995), Nimrod (1997), and Warning (2000) did not achieve the massive success of Dookie, though they were still successful, with Insomniac and Nimrod reaching double platinum and Warning reaching gold status. The band&#x27;s rock opera, American Idiot (2004), reignited the band&#x27;s popularity with a younger generation, selling five million copies in the United States. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, 21st Century Breakdown, was released in 2009 which achieved the band&#x27;s best chart performance to date. 21st Century Breakdown was followed up by a trilogy of albums called !Uno!, !Dos!, and !Tre! released in September, November and December 2012 respectively. They are one of the world&#x27;s best-selling groups of all time, having sold more than 75 million albums and singles worldwide. The group has won five Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Album for Dookie, Best Rock Album for American Idiot, Record of the Year for &quot;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&quot;, Best Rock Album for the second time for 21st Century Breakdown and Best Musical Show Album for American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording. In 2010, a stage adaptation of American Idiot debuted on Broadway. The musical was nominated for three Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Scenic Design and Best Lighting Design, losing only the first. Also in 2010, Green Day were ranked number 91 in the VH1 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;. In 1987, friends Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt, 15 years old at the time, formed a band called Sweet Children. Its first live performance took place on October 17, 1987 at Rod&#x27;s Hickory Pit in Vallejo, California. In 1988, Armstrong and Dirnt began working with Sean Hughes and the former Isocracy drummer John Kiffmeyer, also known as &quot;Al Sobrante&quot;. As said in the film Punk&#x27;s Not Dead, Armstrong cites the band Operation Ivy (which featured Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman of Rancid) as a major influence, and a group that inspired him to form a band. In 1988, Larry Livermore, owner of Lookout! Records, saw the band play an early show and signed the group to his label. In 1989, the band recorded its debut extended play, 1,000 Hours. Before 1,000 Hours was released, the group dropped the name Sweet Children; according to Livermore, this was done to avoid confusion with another local band Sweet Baby. The band adopted the name Green Day, due to their fondness for marijuana. Lookout! would release Green Day&#x27;s debut studio album, 39/Smooth in early 1990. Green Day would record two extended plays later that year, Slappy and Sweet Children, the latter of which included older songs that the band had recorded for the Minneapolis independent record label Skene! Records. In 1991, Lookout! Records re-released 39/Smooth under the name 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours, and added the songs from the band&#x27;s first two EPs, Slappy, and 1,000 Hours. In late 1990, shortly after the band&#x27;s first nationwide tour, Sobrante left the East Bay area to attend college. The Lookouts drummer Tre Cool began filling in as a temporary replacement and later Cool&#x27;s position as Green Day&#x27;s drummer became permanent. The band went on tour for most of 1992 and 1993, and played a number of shows overseas in Europe. The band&#x27;s second studio album Kerplunk sold 50,000 copies in the U. S. Kerplunk&#x27;s underground success led to a number of major record labels being interested in signing Green Day, and the band eventually left Lookout! and signed to Reprise Records after attracting the attention of producer Rob Cavallo. The group was impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo &quot;was the only person we could really talk to and connect with&quot;. Reflecting on the period, Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure &#8230; The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward. &quot; After signing with Reprise, the band went to work on recording its major label debut, Dookie. Recorded in three weeks, and released in February 1994, Dookie became a commercial success, helped by extensive MTV airplay for the videos of the songs &quot;Longview&quot;, &quot;Basket Case&quot;, and &quot;When I Come Around&quot;, all of which reached the number one position on the Modern Rock Tracks charts. At a September 9, 1994 performance at Hatch Memorial Shell in Boston, mayhem broke-out during the band&#x27;s set (cut short to seven songs) and by the end of the rampage, 100 people were injured and 45 arrested. The band also joined the lineups of both the Lollapalooza festival and Woodstock &#x27;94, where they started an infamous mud fight. During the concert, a security guard mistook bassist Mike Dirnt for a stage-invading fan and punched out some of his teeth. Viewed by millions by pay-per-view television, the Woodstock 1994 performance further aided Green Day&#x27;s growing publicity and recognition, and helped push its album to eventual diamond status. In 1995, Dookie won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and the band was nominated for nine MTV Video Music Awards including Video of the Year. In 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, entitled &quot;J. A. R. &quot;. The single debuted at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by the band&#x27;s fourth studio album, Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac was a much darker and heavier response to the band&#x27;s newfound popularity, compared to the more melodic Dookie. The album opened to a warm critical reception, earning 4 out of 5 stars from Rolling Stone, which said &quot;In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets. &quot; The singles released from Insomniac were &quot;Geek Stink Breath&quot;, &quot;Stuck with Me&quot;, &quot;Brain Stew/Jaded&quot;, and &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot;. Though the album did not approach the success of Dookie, it sold two million copies in the United States. In addition, the album won the band award nominations for Favorite Artist, Favorite Hard Rock Artist, and Favorite Alternative Artist at the 1996 American Music Awards, and the video for &quot;Walking Contradiction&quot; got the band a Grammy nomination for Best Video, Short Form, in addition to a Best Special Effects nomination at the MTV Video Music Awards. After that, the band abruptly cancelled a European tour, citing exhaustion. After a brief hiatus in 1996, Green Day began to work on a new album in 1997. From the outset, both the band and Cavallo agreed that the album had to be different from its previous albums. The result was Nimrod, an experimental deviation from the band&#x27;s standard pop-punk brand of music. The new album was released in October 1997. It provided a variety of music, from pop-punk, surf rock, and ska, to an acoustic ballad. Nimrod entered the charts at number 10. The success of &quot;Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)&quot; won the band an MTV Video Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also used in the second &quot;clip show&quot; episode of Seinfeld and on two episodes of ER. The other singles released from Nimrod were &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;, &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot; and &quot;Redundant&quot;. The band made a guest appearance in an episode of King of the Hill entitled &quot;The Man Who Shot Cane Skretteberg&quot;, which aired in 1997. In late 1997 and most of 1998, Green Day embarked on a tour in support of Nimrod. In 1999, the guitarist Jason White began supporting the band on the concerts as rhythm guitarist. In 2000, Green Day released its sixth studio album Warning. In support of the album, the band participated in the Warped Tour in 2000. The band also had an independent tour to support the album in 2001. Critics&#x27; reviews of the album were varied. Allmusic gave it 4. 5/5 saying &quot;Warning may not be an innovative record per se, but it&#x27;s tremendously satisfying. &quot; Rolling Stone was more critical, giving it 3/5, and saying &quot;Warning&#8230; invites the question: Who wants to listen to songs of faith, hope and social commentary from what used to be snot-core&#x27;s biggest-selling band?&quot; Though it produced the hit &quot;Minority&quot; and a smaller hit with &quot;Warning&quot;, some observers were coming to the conclusion that the band was losing relevance, and a decline in popularity followed. While all of Green Day&#x27;s previous albums had reached a status of at least double platinum, Warning was only certified platinum. At the 2001 California Music Awards, Green Day won all eight of the awards that it was nominated for. The group won the awards for Outstanding Album (Warning), Outstanding Punk Rock/Ska Album (Warning), Outstanding Group, Outstanding Male Vocalist, Outstanding Bassist, Outstanding Drummer, Outstanding Songwriter, and Outstanding Artist. The release of two compilation albums, International Superhits! and Shenanigans, followed Warning. International Superhits and its companion collection of music videos, International Supervideos!. Shenanigans contained some of the band&#x27;s b-sides, including &quot;Espionage&quot;, which was featured in the film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. In the spring of 2002, Green Day co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Blink-182 which was documented on the DVD Riding in Vans with Boys. In the summer of 2003, the band went into a studio to write and record new material for a new album, tentatively titled Cigarettes and Valentines. After completing 20 tracks, the master recordings were stolen from the studio. Instead of re-recording the stolen tracks, the band decided to abandon the entire project and start over, considering the taken material to be unrepresentative of the band&#x27;s best work. It was then revealed that a band called The Network was signed to Armstrong&#x27;s record label Adeline Records with little fanfare and information. After the mysterious band released an album called Money Money 2020, it was rumored that The Network was a Green Day side project, due to the similarities in the bands&#x27; sounds. However, these rumors were never addressed by the band or Adeline Records, except for a statement on the Adeline website discussing an ongoing dispute between the two bands. Green Day collaborated with Iggy Pop on two tracks for his album Skull Ring in November 2003. On February 1, 2004 a new song, a cover of &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; made its debut on a commercial for iTunes during NFL Super Bowl XXXVIII. The resulting album, American Idiot (2004), debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, the band&#x27;s first album to reach number one, backed by the success of the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;American Idiot&quot;. The album was labeled as a punk rock opera which follows the journey of the fictitious &quot;Jesus of Suburbia&quot;. The album depicts the modern American life under the control from an idiot ruler who let people be misinformed by media as well as inserted &quot;redneck agenda&quot;. It gives different angles on an everyman, modern icons, and leaders on the topic. Released two months before U. S. President George W. Bush was reelected, the album became protest art. American Idiot won the 2005 Grammy for Best Rock Album. The band also won a total of seven awards out of eight awards for which they were nominated, including the Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award in MTV Video Music Awards 2005. Through 2005, the band toured in support of the album with nearly 150 dates (Longest tour in their career) visiting Japan, Australia, South America and the United Kingdom. While touring for American Idiot, they filmed and recorded the two concerts at the Milton Keynes National Bowl in England, which was voted &#x27;The Best Show On Earth&#x27; in a Kerrang! Magazine Poll. These recordings were released as a live CD and DVD called Bullet in a Bible on November 15, 2005. This CD/DVD featured songs from American Idiot as well as songs from all its previous albums, except Kerplunk and 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours. The DVD featured behind-the-scenes footage of the band, and showed how the band prepared to put on the show. The final shows of its 2005 world tour were in Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, on December 14 and 17 respectively. On August 1, 2005 Green Day announced that it had rescinded the master rights to its pre-Dookie material from Lookout! Records, citing a continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties, a complaint shared with other Lookout! bands. On January 10, 2006 the band was awarded with a People&#x27;s Choice Award as favorite musical group or band. Green Day engaged in a number of other smaller projects in the time following the success of American Idiot. The group released an album under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs entitled Stop Drop and Roll!!! In 2008, the Foxboro Hot Tubs went on a mini-tour to promote the record, hitting tiny Bay Area venues including the Stork Club in Oakland and Toot&#x27;s Tavern in Crockett, California. In an interview with Carson Daly, Garbage lead singer Shirley Manson revealed that Butch Vig would be producing Green Day&#x27;s forthcoming album. The span of nearly five years between American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown was the longest gap between studio albums in Green Day&#x27;s career. The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when two videos showing the band recording in the studio with producer Butch Vig were posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009. 21st Century Breakdown, was released on May 15, 2009. The album received a mainly positive reception from critics, getting an average rating between 3 and 4 stars. After the release, the album reached number one in fourteen countries, being certified gold or platinum in each. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day&#x27;s best chart performance to date. The band started playing shows in California in April and early May. It was their first live show in about three years. Green Day went on a world tour that started in North America in July 2009 and continuing around the world throughout the rest of 2009 and early 2010. Wal-Mart refused to carry the album as it contains a Parental Advisory sticker and requested that Green Day release a censored edition. The band members did not wish to change any lyrics on the album and responded by stating, &quot;There&#x27;s nothing dirty about our record&#8230; They want artists to censor their records in order to be carried in there. We just said no. We&#x27;ve never done it before. You feel like you&#x27;re in 1953 or something. &quot; In 2009, the band met with award-winning director Michael Mayer and many cast and crew members of the Tony Award-winning musical Spring Awakening to create a stage version of the album American Idiot. American Idiot: The Musical opened in the Berkeley Repertory Theatre during the end of 2009. The show features an expanded story of the original album, with new characters such as Will, Extraordinary Girl, and Favorite Son. On April 20, 2010, American Idiot: The Musical opened on Broadway, and Green Day released the soundtrack to the musical, featuring a new song by Green Day entitled &quot;When It&#x27;s Time&quot;. In June 2010 the iTunes received the single &quot;When It&#x27;s Time&quot;. During the Spike TV Video Game Awards 2009, it was announced that Green Day was set to have its own Rock Band video game titled as Green Day: Rock Band, as a follow-up to the last band specific Rock Band game, The Beatles: Rock Band. The game features the full albums of Dookie, American Idiot, and 21st Century Breakdown as well as select songs from the rest of Green Day&#x27;s discography. During the second leg of the 21st Century Breakdown World Tour the band had said that they are writing new material. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, Armstrong spoke about the possible new album: &quot;We did some demos in Berlin, some in Stockholm, some just outside of Glasgow and some in Amsterdam. We wanted get down in some early form. &quot; The band also stated that they were recording a live album during the entire tour on the last date of the tour in Mountain View, California, also before playing the song &quot;Cigarettes and Valentines&quot;. In October 2010, Dirnt was interviewed by Radio W, mentioning that they have completed the writing process of the ninth studio album. In the interview, Dirnt also mentioned that a new live album will &quot;most likely&quot; be released. The live CD/DVD and CD/Blu-ray entitled Awesome as Fuck was released on March 22, 2011. During the end of 2011, the band played several secret shows (under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs) whose setlists consisted almost entirely of previously unheard songs. Green Day entered the studio and began recording new material in February 2012, later announcing a trilogy of albums titled !Uno!, !Dos!, and !Tre! which would be released in the fall of 2012. The trilogy marked longtime touring guitarist Jason White&#x27;s induction as the fourth member of the band. That summer Green Day played several festivals and promotional shows including the Rock en Seine festival in France, the Rock am See festival in Germany, and the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom. !Uno!, !Dos!, and !Tre! were released on September 21, November 9, and December 7, 2012 respectively and were met with generally positive reviews. On January 22, 2013 the band announced that !Cuatro!, a documentary about the making of !Uno!, !Dos! and !Tre!, would premiere on January 26 in Aspen, Colorado as part of the X Games FILM showcase, and would be released on DVD April 9, 2013. Another documentary was announced called Broadway Idiot which focuses on the creation on the American Idiot musical and Armstrong&#x27;s run as playing the character of St. Jimmy. On March 10, 2013, Green Day began their 99 Revolutions Tour to support the trilogy. In June, Green Day broke Emirates Stadium attendance record with 60,000 tickets sold, in the United Kingdom. The band played Dookie from start to finish on several dates on their European leg, including during Reading Festival 2013 headline show. Demolicious, a compilation that album contains alternate versions and demos of songs from !Uno!, !Dos! and !Tre! recorded during the studio sessions of these albums, was released on April 19, 2014, for Record Store Day. It also contains a previously unreleased song called &quot;State of Shock&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Stay the Night&quot;, from !Uno!. Since 1991, members of the band have branched out past Green Day and have started other projects with other musicians. Notable related projects of Green Day include Billie Joe Armstrong&#x27;s Pinhead Gunpowder (which also features Green Day&#x27;s guitarist Jason White), The Frustrators in which Mike Dirnt plays bass, and The Network, a collaboration between Green Day and members of the band, Devo in which all members play under fake stage names. Green Day has also released an album titled Stop Drop and Roll!!! on May 20, 2008, under the name Foxboro Hot Tubs, they currently use this name to book secret shows. In late December 2011, Armstrong formed a new side band called The Boo along his wife Adrienne and their two sons. In September 2006, Green Day collaborated with U2 and producer Rick Rubin to record a cover of the song &quot;The Saints Are Coming&quot;, originally recorded by The Skids, with an accompanying video. The song was recorded to benefit Music Rising, an organization to help raise money for musicians&#x27; instruments lost during Hurricane Katrina, and to bring awareness on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the disaster. In December 2006, Green Day and NRDC opened a web site in partnership to raise awareness on America&#x27;s dependency on oil. Green Day released a cover of the John Lennon song &quot;Working Class Hero&quot;, which was featured on the album Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur. The band performed the song on the season finale of American Idol. The song was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2008 but lost to The White Stripes&#x27; &quot;Icky Thump&quot;. That summer, the band appeared in a cameo role in The Simpsons Movie, where they perform the show&#x27;s theme song. Their version was released as a single on July 24, 2007. In 2009, the band collaborated with theatre director Michael Mayer to adapt their rock opera American Idiot into a one-act stage musical that premiered at the Berkeley Rep on September 15, 2009. The show then moved to Broadway on April 20, 2010. The reviews of American Idiot: The Musical have been positive to mixed. Charles Isherwood of The New York Times wrote an enthusiastic review for the Broadway production. He called the show &quot;a pulsating portrait of wasted youth that invokes all the standard genre conventions &#8230; only to transcend them through the power of its music and the artistry of its execution, the show is as invigorating and ultimately as moving as anything I've seen on Broadway this season. Or maybe for a few seasons past. &quot; Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald enjoyed the premise of the show but found that &quot;the music and message suffer in a setting where the audience is politely, soberly seated&quot;. Michael Kuchiwara of the Associated Press found the show to be &quot;visually striking musically adventurous&quot;, but noted that &quot;the show has the barest wisp of a story and minimal character development&quot;. Paul Kolnik in USA Today enjoyed the contradiction that Green Day&#x27;s &quot;massively popular, starkly disenchanted album &#8230; would be the feel-good musical of the season&quot;. Time magazine&#x27;s Richard Zoglin opined that the score &quot;is as pure a specimen of contemporary punk rock as Broadway has yet encountered there&#x27;s enough variety. &#8230; Where the show fall short is as a fully developed narrative. &quot; He concluded that &quot;American Idiot, despite its earnest huffing and puffing, remains little more than an annotated rock concert. &#8230; Still, deserves at least two cheers - for its irresistible musical energy and for opening fresh vistas for that odd couple, rock and Broadway. &quot; Peter Travers from Rolling Stone, in his review of American Idiot, wrote &quot;Though American Idiot carries echoes of such rock musicals as Tommy, Hair, Rent and Spring Awakening, it cuts its own path to the heart. You won't know what hit you. American Idiot knows no limits--it&#x27;s a global knockout. &quot; The musical has been nominated for three Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Scenic Design. It was also nominated for a number of Drama Desk Awards and Outer Critics Circle Awards. In October 2009, a Green Day art project was exhibited at StolenSpace Gallery in London. The exhibition showed artworks created for each of the songs on 21st Century Breakdown, was supported by the band, and led by their manager Pat Magnarella. He explained in an interview that &quot; basically like rock bands. Most are creating their art, but don&#x27;t know how to promote it. &quot; For Billie Joe Armstrong, &quot;Many of the artists&#8230; show their work on the street, and we feel a strong connection to that type of creative expression. &quot; On April 13, 2011, a film version of American Idiot was confirmed. Michael Mayer, director of the Broadway musical, will be directing the film. It will be produced by Green Day, Pat Magnarella (Green Day&#x27;s manager who also produced Bullet in a Bible, Awesome as Fuck, and Heart Like a Hand Grenade), Playtone (Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman) and Tom Hulce. On January 23, 2013, it was announced that a documentary showing Armstrong&#x27;s journey from punk rock to Broadway was to be released. Called Broadway Idiot and showing a lot of behind-the-scenes of the American Idiot musical production, the movie was directed by Doug Hamilton, veteran television journalist for CBS News&#x27; 60 Minutes and PBS documentaries such as Nova, Frontline and American Masters. A trailer was released on January 30, 2013. The documentary premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 15, 2013. The band has generated controversy over whether the band&#x27;s musical style and major-label status constitutes as &quot;true punk&quot;. In reaction to both the style of music and the background of the band, John Lydon, former front man of the 1970s punk band the Sex Pistols commented: &quot;So there we are fending off all that and it pisses me off that years later a wank outfit like Green Day hop in and nick all that and attach it to themselves. They didn&#x27;t earn their wings to do that and if they were true punk they wouldn&#x27;t look anything like they do. &quot; Armstrong himself has discussed the group&#x27;s status of being a punk band on a major record label, saying &quot;Sometimes I think we&#x27;ve become totally redundant because we&#x27;re this big band now, we&#x27;ve made a lot of money - we&#x27;re not punk rock any more. But then I think about it and just say, &#x27;You can take us out of a punk rock environment, but you can&#x27;t take the punk rock out of us. &#x27;&quot; On September 21, 2012, while Green Day was performing at the iHeartRadio music festival, lead vocalist/guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong stopped while performing Basket Case, because he believed their time was being shortened, possibly in order to extend R&amp;B artist Usher&#x27;s performance. Angered, Armstrong began ranting while a screen in the rear of the audience was labeled &quot;1 Minutes Left&quot;, saying &quot;You&#x27;re not gonna give me one fucking minute? You&#x27;ve gotta be fucking kidding me!&quot;. He also told the crowd he was not Justin Bieber and labeled the festival as a &quot;joke&quot;. When the screen went blank, Armstrong smashed his guitar, while bassist Mike Dirnt smashed his bass. Armstrong then gave the finger, and declared that Green Day would be back before throwing his microphone down and walking off the stage. Two days later, the band&#x27;s representative apologized for the incident on their behalf stating that &quot;Green Day would like everyone to know that their set was not cut short by Clear Channel and to apologize to those they offended at the iHeartRadio Festival in Las Vegas&quot; also adding that Armstrong will be headed to rehab, for abuse of alcohol and prescription pills for anxiety and insomnia. However Mike Dirnt would later say in an interview with Rolling Stone that he agreed with what Billie Joe meant by his rant", "Helen": "There are more than one artist with name Helen[: 1) Liz Harris, better known as Grouper, has formed a new band called Helen. 2) Italo-Disco group. 3) Armenian singer. 4) Filipino band playing live drum n bass with a bit of funk. 3) Helen was born in Tehran, Iran to an Armenian family. She demonstrated her vocal talents as a very young child, and at the age of 15, she was accepted to the prestigious Tehran Conservatory of Music. During her rigorous music education, Helen's studies were focused on opera as well as classical piano. Shortly after graduation, Helen set off to travel, journeying extensively throughout Europe from 1985 to 1995. Much of her time was spent in Germany where her career took off. Helen has performed with many famous Iranian singers in concerts and other events all over Europe. In 1995 Helen moved to United States. Since her arrival here, she has completed six pop solo albums and performed in numerous concerts on a worldwide basis, thrilling diverse audiences with her wide musical range and multi-lingual skills in Armenian, Farsi, Arabic, English, and Spanish. She made her American television debut in 2004 portraying a singer on the popular TV series, JAG, produced by Paramount Pictures. ", "The Libertines": "The Libertines are an English band that formed in London, England in 1997 and disbanded in 2004. They reformed in 2010 to play the Reading and Leeds festivals. The band released two full-length LPs, both produced by Mick Jones of The Clash. Centered around the song-writing partnership and chemistry between Peter Doherty (vocals/rhythm guitar) and Carl Barat (vocals/lead guitar), while backed by John Hassall (bass) and Gary Powell (drums), the band was one of the cornerstones of the English independent scene in the early 2000&#x27;s. Championed by NME, the band&#x27;s first single What a Waster charted at number 37, despite being banned from Radio 1 and commercial radio due to an overabundance of foul language; this set the trend for steadily increasing returns, culminating in a #2 single and #1 album in the UK Charts. However, the band&#x27;s music was often eclipsed by its internal conflicts, many of which stemmed from Doherty&#x27;s considerable drug use, and it was mostly because of this that after a final show in Paris (without Pete) that the band was disbanded at the end of 2004. The former members of The Libertines have gone on to form three splinter bands, with varying degrees of commercial and critical success. These bands include Peter Doherty in Babyshambles, Carl Barat and Gary Powell in Dirty Pretty Things and John Hassall in Yeti. Pete and Carl recently came back to work on Babyshambles&#x27; charity cover of The Clash&#x27;s &#x27;Janie Jones&#x27; for Strummerville. Carl and Pete also performed 13 songs together in April 2007 as Carl appeared on stage at one of Pete&#x27;s shows. On the 29th of March 2010 the Libertines announced they had reunited to play the Leeds and Reading festivals in August. On 20 April 2014 an image of London&#x27;s Hyde Park was released to the band&#x27;s Facebook page. Around this time both Carl Barat and Peter Doherty indicated in interviews that they had accepted an offer to play the venue on July 5, 2014. On 25 April, it was confirmed that The Libertines will play on Saturday 5 July in London&#x27;s Hyde Park, headlining the day, as part of the Barclaycard British Summer Time series of concerts. Support for the concert will be provided by a number of bands and artists, most notably The Pogues, Spiritualized, Maximo Park, Raglans and The Enemy On 20 May, it was confirmed that The Libertines will play on Saturday 19 July in Benicassim FIB, Spain, as headliners. They have also announced a European tour, their first tour in 10 years, consisting of 9 dates and are reportedly in talks to release a new album. ", "Wilco": "Wilco is a rock band which formed in 1994 in Chicago, Illinois, United States by the remaining members of alternative country group Uncle Tupelo following singer Jay Farrar&#x27;s departure from that group. Wilco&#x27;s lineup has changed frequently, with only singer Jeff Tweedy and bassist John Stirratt remaining from the original incarnation. The other current members are guitarist Nels Cline, multi-instrumentalists Pat Sansone and Mikael Jorgensen, and drummer Glenn Kotche. Wilco has released eight nine studio albums, a live double album, and three collaborations: two with Billy Bragg, and one with The Minus 5. Wilco&#x27;s music has been inspired by a wide variety of artists and styles, including Bill Fay and Television, and has in turn influenced music by The National and Cherry Ghost. The band continued in the alternative country of Uncle Tupelo on its debut album A. M. (1995), but has since introduced more experimental aspects to their music. Wilco garnered media attention for its fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot (2002), and the controversy surrounding it. After the recording sessions were complete, Reprise Records rejected the album and dismissed Wilco from the label. As part of a buy-out deal, Reprise gave Wilco the rights to the album for free. After streaming Foxtrot on its website, Wilco sold the album to Nonesuch Records in 2002. Both record labels are subsidiaries of Warner Music Group, leading one critic to say that the album showed &quot;how screwed up the music business in the early twenty-first century. &quot; Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is Wilco&#x27;s most successful release to date, selling over 590,000 copies. Wilco won two Grammy Awards for their fifth studio album, 2004&#x27;s A Ghost Is Born , including Best Alternative Music Album. The I Might Songfacts reports that Wilco&#x27;s eighth album, The Whole Love (2011), marked the first ever release on the band&#x27;s own label dBpm. Formation Wilco was formed following the breakup of the influential alternative country music group Uncle Tupelo. Singer Jay Farrar quit the band in 1994 supposedly because of a soured relationship with co-singer Jeff Tweedy. Both Tweedy and Farrar sought to form bands immediately after the breakup. Tweedy was able to keep the entire Uncle Tupelo lineup sans Farrar, including bassist John Stirratt, drummer Ken Coomer, and multi-instrumentalist Max Johnston. The band was tempted to keep the Uncle Tupelo name, but ultimately decided to rename the band. The group named itself &quot;Wilco&quot; after the CB radio voice procedure for &quot;I Will Comply&quot;.  A. M. and Being There After collaborating with Syd Straw on a cover version of the Ernest Tubb song, &quot;The T. B. is Whipping Me&quot; (released in September 1994 on the Red Hot + Country compilation), Wilco began recording tracks for A. M. , their first studio album, at Easley studio in June 1995. A demo tape from these recordings was sent to executives at Reprise Records, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers, and the label signed Tweedy to a contract. Although Tweedy stated that he wanted a more collaborative project than Uncle Tupelo, only his name appeared on the Reprise contract. Tweedy requested songwriting submissions from other members, but only one submission--John Stirratt&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Just That Simple&quot;--appeared on A. M. . It was the last song Wilco ever released that was solely written by a member besides Tweedy. Stylistically similar to Uncle Tupelo, the music on A. M. was considered to be straightforward alternative country rock in what Tweedy later described as &quot;trying to tread some water with a perceived audience. &quot; A. M. peaked at number twenty-seven on the Billboard Heatseekers chart, considerably lower than the debut album of Jay Farrar&#x27;s new band, Son Volt. The album was met with modest reviews though it would rank thirty-fourth in the Village Voice &#x27;s 1995 Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. Critically and commercially paling in comparison to the reception of Son Volt&#x27;s album, the Wilco members perceived A. M. to be a failure. Shortly after the release of the album, multi-instrumentalist Jay Bennett joined the band, providing the band with a keyboardist and another guitarist. Wilco made its live debut on November 17, 1994 to a capacity crowd at Cicero&#x27;s Basement Bar in St. Louis, Missouri (the band was billed for the occasion as &quot;Black Shampoo&quot;). During the two hundred-date tour supporting A. M. , Tweedy began to write songs for a second album. The lyrical theme of the songs reflected a relationship between musical artist and a listener; Tweedy chose this topic because he sought to eschew the alternative country fan base. Ken Coomer elaborated: &quot;The whole No Depression thing was funny to us because people seemed to forget that Jeff was a bigger punk-rock fan than a country fan. It led to things like us all switching instruments on &#x27;Misunderstood,&#x27; where I&#x27;m playing guitar. &quot; A number of songs were recorded with this theme, including &quot;Sunken Treasure&quot; and &quot;Hotel Arizona&quot;, however, Wilco also recorded a number of songs in the style of A. M. Wilco named the album Being There after a Peter Sellers film of the same name . The band went through some personnel changes during the recording sessions. Max Johnston left the band because he felt that his role in the band had diminished in favor of Bennett; he had also been replaced by violinist Jesse Greene on one track because the band felt that Johnston was unable to play the part. Bob Egan of Freakwater briefly joined the band in the studio, playing pedal steel guitar on &quot;Far, Far Away&quot; and &quot;Dreamer in My Dreams&quot;, and then became an official member in September 1996. Unlike the A. M. recording sessions, the band had no vocation for producing a hit song from their second effort. The recording sessions produced nineteen songs, too many for a single album release. Tweedy was concerned about the high retail price that a double album would be sold for (at least $30), so he asked Reprise Records to release it as a double album at a single album price ($17. 98 or less). Reprise agreed to this on the terms that they received Wilco&#x27;s share of the album royalties. It was estimated in 2003 that the band lost almost $600,000 on the deal, but Tweedy was satisfied. Being There was well-received by critics from several major media outlets, including Rolling Stone . The album reached #73 on the Billboard album charts, a significant improvement from A. M. , and placed fourteenth on the Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll for 1996. Summerteeth and the Mermaid Avenue sessions In November 1997, Wilco entered Willie Nelson&#x27;s recording studio in Spicewood, Texas to record a third studio album. The album was lyrically inspired by the marital problems of Tweedy and his wife, as well as by twentieth-century literature. Tweedy relied heavily on Bennett to provide music for the singer&#x27;s &quot;bold, but depressing&quot; lyrics. Wilco recorded several songs, including &quot;Via Chicago&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s a Jar,&quot; but began working on another project before assembling the tracks into an album. Nora Guthrie contacted singer-songwriter Billy Bragg in spring 1995 about recording some unreleased songs by her father, folk singer Woody Guthrie. Most of the songs were written late in Guthrie&#x27;s life when he was unable to record due to the motor impairments of Huntington&#x27;s disease . By the 1990s, Woody Guthrie had become a &quot;relic&quot; to the MTV generation, and Nora sought to establish a different legacy for the musician. To Nora, Bragg was &quot;the only singer I knew taking on the same issues as Woody. &quot; Bragg was concerned, however, that his fans would not realize that the songs were written by Guthrie when he performed them on tour, so he decided to record the album with another band. Bragg contacted Tweedy and Bennett about co-recording the album while Wilco was on the European segment of their Being There tour. Bragg was particularly fond of Being There because their influences extended farther back than the 1950s. Although Tweedy was indifferent to the offer, Bennett was enthused about recording songs of one of his idols--Bennett&#x27;s previous band Titanic Love Affair was named after a Billy Bragg lyric. A recording contract between Bragg and Wilco was signed after a show at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. Bragg mostly recorded the politically-charged lyrics, while Tweedy preferred to record lyrics that showcased Guthrie as a &quot;freak weirdo. &quot; The recording of Mermaid Avenue began on December 12, 1997, and was the topic of BBC &#x27;s Man in the Sand documentary film. Tempers flared between Bragg and Wilco after the album was completed. Bennett believed that Bragg was overproducing his songs, a sharp contrast to Wilco&#x27;s sparser contributions. Bennett called Bragg about the possibility of remixing Bragg&#x27;s songs, to which Bragg responded with &quot;you make your record, and I&#x27;ll make mine, fucker. &quot; Eventually Bragg sent copies of his recordings to Chicago for Bennett to remix, but Bragg refused to use the new mixes on the album. The two parties were unable to establish a promotional tour and quarreled over royalties and guest musician fees. Despite these conflicts, the album was released on June 23, 1998, and sold over 277,000 copies. The album received rave reviews from Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone , and was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album. It also placed fourth on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll for 1998. After the album was released, Bob Egan was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Leroy Bach. After the completion of the Mermaid Avenue sessions, Wilco returned to Spicewood to complete their third studio album, Summerteeth . Unlike previous Wilco and Uncle Tupelo recordings, the album featured a lot of overdubbing with Pro Tools . Stirratt and Coomer were concerned with the production, since it reduced their involvement in the music. According to Stirratt: &quot;The story of Summerteeth is Jay bought a Mellotron and he was going to use it, no matter what. It was lovely, but it was overdone. Once they got going on the overdubs, they didn&#x27;t stop. And nobody in the band stepped up to stop the madness . . . It reminds me of Heart of Darkness , where you knowingly extend the creative process for the purpose of exploration or redemption, or whatever it is you&#x27;re looking for. &quot; During 1999, Warner Brothers was looking to help repay a $16 billion debt acquired during the recent merger of parent company Warner Communications with Time Inc. . As a result, Warner&#x27;s imprints were under pressure to produce musical acts that would yield hit records. The head of Reprise, Howie Klein, who had previously authorized the release of Being There as a double album, was willing to let Wilco produce Summerteeth without label input. When Klein played the album for Reprise&#x27;s A&amp;R department, however, they demanded a radio single for the album. Wilco agreed to do this &quot;once and once only&quot; and recorded a radio-friendly version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot; at the request of David Kahne, the head of the A&amp;R department. The single version of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot; failed to cross over from Triple-A radio to alternative rock stations. Consequently, the album sold only 200,000 copies, significantly less than Being There . This was despite critical acclaim; the album placed eighth on the Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1999. After the release of Summerteeth , the band resumed the Mermaid Avenue sessions. Although they had recorded enough material for a second release in 1998, Wilco recorded a few new songs for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II . &quot;Someday Some Morning Sometime,&quot; featuring a vibraphone filtered through a space echo, was identified by Tweedy as being the &quot;piece to the puzzle&quot; towards the creation of their fourth studio album. The album was released on May 30, 2000, and was the last release from the sessions. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot Shortly after the recording sessions for Mermaid Avenue Vol. II , Wilco purchased a studio in Irving Park, Chicago, which they named the Wilco Loft. The band recorded some tracks in the studio in early 2000 for a fourth studio album. In May 2000, Jeff Tweedy requested to perform with Jim O&#x27;Rourke at a festival in Chicago; Tweedy was a fan of O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s Bad Timing . O&#x27;Rourke introduced Tweedy to drummer Glenn Kotche, and the trio enjoyed working together so much that they decided to record an album as a side project named Loose Fur. Wilco had recorded an entire album of music at this point, but Tweedy was unhappy with the drum parts. He enjoyed Kotche&#x27;s contributions to Loose Fur so much that Tweedy brought him into the studio to re-record some demos. Some believe that Tweedy sought to make Wilco sound like Loose Fur after officially replacing Ken Coomer with Kotche in January 2001. Although Bennett sought to act as both mixer and engineer for Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Tweedy was unsure of Bennett&#x27;s abilities against those of O&#x27;Rourke. Tweedy and Bennett frequently argued over whether the album should be accessible to a general listener, or attempt to cover new musical ground. Unbeknownst to Bennett, Tweedy invited O&#x27;Rourke to remix &quot;I Am Trying to Break Your Heart&quot;, and the results impressed the other band members--even Bennett. Tensions grew between Bennett and O&#x27;Rourke because Bennett wanted to mix every song on the album. O&#x27;Rourke cut the contributions of other members on several of the songs; some songs, such as &quot;Poor Places&quot;, only featured the Loose Fur trio. The album was completed in 2001, and Bennett left the band immediately afterwards. The recording of the album was documented by Sam Jones and released in 2002 as the film I Am Trying to Break Your Heart . Time Warner, which owned Warner Brothers, merged with America Online in 2001, leading to more pressure on Warner&#x27;s record labels to cut costs. Over 600 employees of Warner Music Group were fired, including Howie Klein, the president of Reprise Records. In absence of Klein, David Kahne became the interim head of Reprise. Kahne assigned Mio Vukovic to monitor the progress of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and to offer suggestions. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that Vukovic disdained the album and was unhappy that Wilco ignored his suggestions. He brought the album to Kahne, who felt that there was no single on the album. In June 2001, the album was rejected by Reprise and Wilco was asked to leave the label. Wilco managed to negotiate terms to a buy-out from Reprise. Music journalist Greg Kot claims that instead of financial compensation, the band agreed to leave the label with the master tapes of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot . The label was already receiving bad publicity for its treatment of the band and were willing to accommodate Wilco&#x27;s request. However, Allmusic claims that Wilco &quot;bought the finished studio tapes from Warner/Reprise for a reported $50,000 and left the label altogether&quot; after Wilco was &quot;unwilling to change the album to make it more &#x27;commercially viable. &#x27;&quot; To curb the negative publicity, Reprise began to invest more in bands such as The Flaming Lips. Lead singer Wayne Coyne once remarked: &quot;We are benefiting from the label&#x27;s regret over Wilco. We are living in the golden age of that being such a public mistake. The people on Warners said, &#x27;we&#x27;ll never have a band like Wilco feel we don&#x27;t believe in them again. &#x27; They&#x27;d tell me that it would never happen to us. And what a great day for me!&quot; As the band searched for a new label to release the album, they decided to stream it at their official website to discourage illegal trading of low-quality MP3s. The band signed with Nonesuch Records, another Time Warner subsidiary, and the album was released in the spring of 2002. When it was released, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot reached number thirteen on the Billboard 200, Wilco&#x27;s highest chart position to that date. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sold over 590,000 copies, and to date remains Wilco&#x27;s best selling album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with wide critical acclaim: it topped 2002&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll, was named one of the 100 greatest albums of all time by Q Magazine , and was named one of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time by Rolling Stone . Down with Wilco , A Ghost Is Born , and Kicking Television: Live in Chicago While waiting for the commercial release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Wilco agreed to support R. E. M. collaborator Scott McCaughey for an album release by The Minus 5. They scheduled a recording session for September 11, 2001, but were distraught about the 9/11 terrorist attacks that day. Later that day, Wilco and McCaughey agreed to &quot;create something good in the world right now&quot; and record some material. Influenced by Bill Fay&#x27;s Time of the Last Persecution , The Minus 5&#x27;s Down with Wilco was released in 2003. In November 2003, Wilco traveled to New York City to record their fifth album. Unlike Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , A Ghost Is Born featured songs that were created with Pro Tools before ever performing them live. The album featured the song &quot;Less Than You Think&quot;, which included a fifteen-minute track of electronic noises and synthesizers, which Tweedy called &quot;the track that everyone will hate&quot;. Tweedy justified the inclusion of the song: &quot;I know ninety-nine percent of our fans won&#x27;t like that song, they&#x27;ll say its a ridiculous indulgence. Even I don&#x27;t want to listen to it every time I play through the album. But the times I do calm myself down and pay attention to it, I think it&#x27;s valuable and moving and cathartic. I wouldn&#x27;t have put it on the record if I didn&#x27;t think it was great . . . I wanted to make an album about identity, and within that is the idea of a higher power, the idea of randomness, and that anything can happen, and that we can&#x27;t control it. &quot; Leroy Bach left the band immediately after the album&#x27;s completion to join a music theatre operation in Chicago. Like Yankee Hotel Foxtrot , Wilco streamed the album online before its commercial release. Instead of using their own web page, the band streamed it in MPEG-4 form on Apple&#x27;s website. Wilco sought to substantially change their lineup after Bach&#x27;s departure, and added Mikael Jorgensen, who had engineered Down with Wilco , Pat Sansone of The Autumn Defense, and avant-garde guitarist Nels Cline to the lineup. Just as the band was about to tour to promote the album, Tweedy checked himself in to a rehabilitation clinic in Chicago for an addiction to painkillers. As a result, tour plans for Europe were canceled, and the release date for the album was set back several weeks. A Ghost Is Born was released on June 22, 2004, and became Wilco&#x27;s first top ten album in the U. S. The album earned Wilco Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Music Album and Best Recording Package in 2005. It also placed thirteenth on 2004&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop Critics Poll. In 2004, the band released The Wilco Book , a picture book detailing the creation of A Ghost Is Born . The book also contains writings and drawings from band members, as well as a CD with demos from the A Ghost Is Born recording sessions. Also that year, Chicago Tribune music critic Greg Kot released a biography of the band entitled Wilco: Learning How to Die . The new six-piece Wilco lineup debuted on Kicking Television: Live in Chicago , a two disc live album recorded at The Vic Theater in Chicago. Released on November 15, 2005, the album received high accolades from Spin, Billboard, and Entertainment Weekly. As of 2007, it has sold over 114,000 copies. Sky Blue Sky Wilco returned to their loft in Chicago to record a sixth studio album in 2006. Influenced by The Byrds and Fairport Convention, the band considered Sky Blue Sky to be less experimental than previous releases. Also unlike previous albums, the songs were created as collaborations. Wilco streamed the album online on March 3, 2007, and offered the song &quot;What Light&quot; as a free MP3 download. To further publicize the album, Wilco licensed several songs from the Sky Blue Sky recording sessions for use in a Volkswagen advertising campaign. The move was criticized by both critics and fans; Wilco responded by noting that they had previously done advertising campaigns with Apple Computers and Telefonica Moviles (Movistar). The album was released on May 15, 2007, and was a commercial success: it sold over 87,000 copies in its first week and peaked in the top five in the U. S. album charts. It also was a top forty hit in seven other countries. Reviewer James Brubaker states that Wilco \"shines on a handful of the songs\" on Sky Blue Sky , such as the \"light, and straightforward\" songs. While he calls the album \"great traditional rock and folk album at times\", he states that \"once you get past the handful of masterful and lovely performances. . . the rest of the record comes off at times as dull, and forced\". The allaboutjazz review also had mixed comments. While praising the album as \"deceptively insinuating, almost intoxicating to listen to\" and noting its \"impeccable sound quality\", the reviewer claimed that \" Sky Blue Sky becomes the first Wilco album that sounds too careful for its own good. \" Pabs Hernandez, a reviewer for Lost at Sea praised the album's \"breezy atmosphere and pacing\", and noted that it is not \"easily judged upon first listen. \" Overall, Hernandez stated that it \"may be no masterpiece, but at worst it&#x27;s a more than worthy entry into Wilco&#x27;s laudable catalogue. \" Reviewer Greg Locke praised the record as \"one of the best albums of the year\", calling it a \"timeless record, full of sweet, hopeful sophistication and class\" and \"a lean, mean, soulful album. \" Like Hernandez, Locke acknowledged that the album could not be properly judged just on the first listening. The NPR review also had a positive take on the record. While the NPR reviewer stated that the recording \"isn&#x27;t groundbreaking\", they praised its \"coherent musical expression\" and emphasis on \"solid songcraft without pretense\" which created a \"satisfying and melodically sound albu. \" Musical style and influence Wilco&#x27;s music is typically categorized as alternative rock and alternative country. Despite their career long association with a major record label, they are generally associated with indie rock. Wilco draws influence from bands from a variety of musical genres, but primarily from music created between 1966 and 1974. John Cale&#x27;s Paris 1919 was credited by the band as providing a musical parallel. According to Tweedy, &quot;It was eye-opening that I wasn&#x27;t the only person that felt like these worlds had a lot more in common than they&#x27;d been given credit for--that experimentation and avant-garde theory was not directly opposed to beauty, y&#x27;know?&quot; Other recording artists from that timespan appreciated by the band include John Lennon, Neil Young, and Brian Wilson. For his thirty-fourth birthday, Tweedy received a private guitar lesson from Richard Lloyd of Television; Tweedy was a big fan of the group and was particularly fond of the guitar work, which he wanted to incorporate into his music. Uncle Tupelo was inspired by bands such as Jason &amp; the Scorchers and The Minutemen, influencing the recording of Wilco&#x27;s A. M. . Tweedy and O&#x27;Rourke enjoyed free jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, Albert Ayler, and Derek Bailey; they also listen to mainstream jazz by artists such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The lyrical structure of Wilco&#x27;s songs were dictated by classic literature and cadavre exquis--an exercise where band members take turns writing lines on a typewriter, but are only allowed to see the previously written line. Among the books that the band has cited as being stylistically influential include William H. Gass &#x27;s In the Heart of the Heart of the Country , Henry Miller &#x27;s Tropic of Cancer , and Harold Bloom &#x27;s The Anxiety of Influence: A Theory of Poetry . Some critics have dubbed Wilco the &quot;American Radiohead&quot;, due to their stylistically diverse catalog. A critic from the New York Times argues that Wilco has a &quot;roots-rock&#8230; reached back to proven materials: the twang of country, the steady chug of 1960s rock, the undulating sheen of the Beach Boys, the honky-tonk hymns of the Band and the melodic symmetries of pop. &quot; Rolling Stone described Wilco as &quot;one of America&#x27;s most consistently interesting bands&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s foremost rock impressionists. &quot; Despite critical acclaim, Wilco&#x27;s influence on modern rock has been limited. Bands that have been influenced by Wilco include Derek Webb (of Caedmon&#x27;s Call), The National, and Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. English indie rock band Cherry Ghost took its name from a lyric from the Wilco song &quot;Theologians&quot; (from A Ghost Is Born )--lead singer Simon Aldred is a self-proclaimed &quot;massive Wilco fan&quot;. Pete Yorn&#x27;s song &quot;Crystal Village&quot; was influenced by Wilco&#x27;s &quot;She&#x27;s A Jar. &quot; On his 2004 album Live From New Jersey he introduces the song by saying, &quot;Someone accused me of ripping off Cat Stevens. And I was like, &#x27;That&#x27;s bullshit, man. I would never rip off Cat Stevens. &#x27; I ripped off Wilco on that song. &quot; http://www. wilcoworld. net", "Breaking Benjamin": "Breaking Benjamin is a post-grunge/alternative metal band Formed in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, USA in 1998 by vocalist Benjamin Burnley and drummer Jeremy Hummel, Breaking Benjamin quickly garnered a strong local following. 1st Studio Album - Saturate The band signed to Hollywood Records in 2001 after the success of an independently-released, self-titled EP, which sold all 2,000 copies that were manufactured. Hollywood Records released their full-length, major-label debut, Saturate, on August 27, 2002. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Polyamorous&quot;, received a fair amount of radio play, although it failed to reach mainstream audiences. A video was released in two different versions for Polyamorous: one that had all live-action footage, and one that had footage of the video game Run Like Hell. The following single &quot;Skin&quot; was also released from Saturate, although it fared worse than &quot;Polyamorous&quot; and received even less airplay. &quot;Skin&quot; was also performed live on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show. &quot;Medicate&quot; was also released as a single, to little commercial success and airplay. Saturate has gone on to sell over 300,000 copies. 2nd Studio Album - We Are Not Alone Breaking Benjamin released their second album, We Are Not Alone, on June 29, 2004. The album featured the lead off single &quot;So Cold&quot;, which reached number two on the United States Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. The band had two music videos made for the song, one of which was a promotional video made for the movie Hellboy. The commercial success of &quot;So Cold&quot; led to We Are Not Alone achieving platinum status in late 2005. Also released as singles from the album were &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; and a re- recorded version of &quot;Rain&quot;, which was featured on later pressings of the album. While the former again got the band as high as number two on the Mainstream Rock chart and featured a music video, the latter garnered little radio play and had no video created for it. Another song off &quot;We Are Not Alone&quot;, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, had a video created for it and got a fair amount of radio play. Later in 2004, the band released the So Cold EP. The EP contained live recordings of We Are Not Alone&#x27;s &quot;So Cold&quot; (an acoustic recording), &quot;Breakdown&quot;, and &quot;Away&quot;, as well as studio recordings of &quot;Blow Me Away&quot;, a song that was featured in Bungie&#x27;s video game Halo 2, and &quot;Lady Bug&quot;, an early fan favorite of the band&#x27;s. In September of 2004, drummer, and founding member of Breaking Benjamin, Jeremy Hummel was relieved of his duties in the band. Subsequently, on September 28, 2005, Hummel filed a federal lawsuit against the remaining members of Breaking Benjamin, as well as its management, claiming he was not paid for songs he helped write. Hummel&#x27;s lawsuit asked for more than $8 million in damages. A message was released October 25, 2006 on the bands official website stating that the band and Hummel had come to agreement on the lawsuit. 3rd Studio Album - Phobia In the fall of 2006 the band began a tour opening for Godsmack for the IV tour, hitting up mostly eastern and Ohio Valley venues, and soon moving out west, still in support of the Phobia album, released on August 8 that year. Several of the shows had been canceled, or turned into Breaking Benjamin headliners due to scheduling conflicts. Many of Breaking Benjamin&#x27;s tour dates from December 3rd have been rescheduled due to illness in the band&#x27;s ranks. All dates were rescheduled as the band announced another headlining leg before going on a nationwide tour with Three Days Grace and Nickelback. On March 4, 2007, HDNet premiered a one-hour show of the Breaking Benjamin concert in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania at Stabler Arena. This is also the concert that was included on the Phobia re-release DVD in April of 2007, advertised as &quot;The Homecoming&quot;. Footage of the band&#x27;s live Stabler Arena performance of &quot;Breath&quot; comprises the song&#x27;s music video. On April 17, 2007, Breaking Benjamin re-released the album Phobia. The album featured a DVD with about an hour of their Stabler Arena concert footage. 4th Studio Album - Dear Agony On the 29th of September, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released their 4th studio album, entitled &quot;Dear Agony&quot;. Some of the tracks on the album, were co-written by Jasen Rauch, from the Christian-metal band Red. On September 23, 2009, Breaking Benjamin released a flash video game parody of Altered Beast, aptly titled &quot;Altered Benjamin&quot;. The game contains three levels and plays the same as the original, except the player controls vocalist Ben Burnley and the three bosses are each other member of the band respectively. Altered Benjamin is still available through the band&#x27;s website, and their MySpace page. Certain copies of Dear Agony purchased at Best Buy also come with a bonus DVD that includes the band&#x27;s six music videos including a previously-unreleased version of the video for &quot;I Will Not Bow&quot;. The version on the DVD is of the band only and does not contain any footage from the movie Surrogates, unlike the version released on the Internet. On August 31st, 2009, prior to the release of Dear Agony, Breaking Benjamin released their first single from DA, &quot;I Will Not Bow&quot;. It was featured in the 2009 Sci-Fi film , &quot;Surrogates&quot;. The song was not written specifically for the film, but according to drummer Chad Szeliga, \"Ben sent a few songs to our record label, Hollywood Records,\" which is owned by Disney, who then decided they \"wanted a Breaking Benjamin song for this movie. \" The music video for I Will Not Bow was released to the band&#x27;s Myspace on August 21, 2009. The video was shot at the World Trade Center building 7, but has no connection or significant meaning having to do with the 9/11 events as stated by Aaron Fink in his Point interview on August 13, 2009. The video was directed by Rich Lee who has also directed for Evanescence. Lee chose the location, feeling it was an eerie place to film. A second version of the music video without the Surrogates footage was released with the Best Buy Exclusive version of Dear Agony. It includes various bridged footage of the band performing. On January 5, 2010, Give Me a Sign was the second single released from Breaking Benjamin&#x27;s fourth studio album, Dear Agony. 2 extra tracks were featured on the Japanese version of &quot;Dear Agony&quot;. An acoustic version of &#x27;Without You&#x27;, and an acoustic version &#x27;Give Me A Sign&#x27;. Hiatus, greatest hits album and legal issues In the summer of 2010, Breaking Benjamin announced an indefinite hiatus, due to Burnley&#x27;s recurring illnesses. Guitarist Fink and bassist Klepaski rejoined their old band, Lifer, and Szeliga toured with his other band, OurAfter. On June 7, 2011, a remixed version of &quot;Blow Me Away&quot;, featuring Valora, was released. An animated music video for the remix was released on August 24. On June 30, 2011, Rock Access posted the tracklist for the band&#x27;s greatest hits album, Shallow Bay: The Best of Breaking Benjamin, and for its &quot;deluxe edition&quot;. It was released on August 16, as a one-disc &quot;standard edition&quot; and a two-disc &quot;deluxe edition&quot; (featuring b-sides and rarities). Burnley publicly opposed the album&#x27;s release, saying content had been altered and released without his consent, and that it did not meet his standards. In May 2011, Burnley fired bandmates Fink and Klepaski. Shortly after, a dispute over the new version of &quot;Blow Me Away&quot; went public. Burnley gave his side of the dispute in a June court filing, saying Fink and Klepaski made unilateral and unauthorized decisions on behalf of the band, such as giving permission in May for the remixing of &quot;Blow Me Away&quot;. Burnley seeks at least $250,000 and the exclusive right to the &quot;Breaking Benjamin&quot; name. Burnley has stated he plans to revive the band when the lawsuit is settled. Little was heard from the band throughout 2012, the only exception being a February 2012 interview with Szeliga, where he assured fans that the band was still together, and that he looked forward to working on another record in the future. On April 19, 2013, Burnley announced that the legal issues had finally ended, with Burnley winning the rights to the name of the band. However, Szeliga posted an announcement on his Facebook page on April 22 that he was leaving the band, due to creative differences. In October-November 2013, Burnley played a number of acoustic performances around the Wilkes-Barre area, playing Breaking Benjamin songs. Reformation On August 19, 2014, the band announced that they had reformed via their official Facebook page. The band re-emerged as a quintet, consisting Burnley as the lead vocalist and four new members. New members include guitarist Jasen Rauch, previously of the band Red, who had previously collaborated with the band off of four tracks on Dear Agony, guitarist Keith Wallen, previously of Adelitas Way, bassist Aaron Bruch, who played a couple of acoustic shows previously with Burnley, and drummer Shaun Foist, previously of the band Picture Me Broken.

Name Origin The name &quot;Breaking Benjamin&quot; comes from Benjamin Burnley&#x27;s early solo experience. Burnley was covering a Nirvana song during an open-mic night at a club when he finished he dropped the microphone to the ground, breaking it. The person who owned the microphone came on stage and said, &#x27;Thanks to Benjamin for breaking my fucking mic. &#x27; In 1999, the band briefly renamed themselves &quot;Plan 9. &quot; In late 2000, after various line-up changes, the band changed its name back to &quot;Breaking Benjamin&quot; and two friends of Burnley, Aaron Fink and Mark Klepaski, left their previous band, Lifer, and joined the ranks of Breaking Benjamin as guitarist and bassist, respectively. Lifer was a band that gained brief mainstream attention because of their part in an MTV cover band contest that resulted in a record deal with Universal Records.

Dylan started his musical odyssey in 1959 when he began playing in Dinkytown, Minneapolis while attending the University of Minnesota. Shortly after starting to play he changed his stage name to Bob Dylan, after being influenced by the poetry of Dylan Thomas before legally changing his name in 1962. Much of his best known work is from the 1960s, when he became an informal documentarian and reluctant figurehead of American unrest, promoted by Joan Baez. Some of his songs, such as &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; and &quot;The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;&quot;, became anthems of the anti-war and civil rights movements, with Joan Baez and Dylan singing together at the March on Washington in 1963. However he later became disenchanted with the and civil liberty protest scene, feeling that he had been used by them. His album Bringing It All Back Home marked a move away from the folk scene and a move towards rock and roll and Dylan began to consciously distance himself from his early association with civil rights. He also started to become irritated when being interviewed, often given facetious or irreverent answers to questions. Bringing It All Back Home was a controversial album as it the first on which he played electric guitar. This was seen by some of his fans as a betrayal of this folk roots, with some saying that it obscured his meaningful and poetic lyrics. The second half of the 1960s was marked by a string of well received releases, with his song &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;, released in July of 1965, later being named &quot;The Greatest Song of All Time&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine in 2004, placing #1 in a list of 500 titles. It also marked the formation of Dylan&#x27;s backing band The Hawks (who would later call themselves simply The Band). Dylan embarked on a world tour of Australia and Europe in 1966, during which he seemed to be under a lot of strain and pressure by both his fans, the music press and his own promoters. Dylan himself admitted that he began taking drugs seriously whilst on this tour, and found it immensely hard work. On returning to New York he crashed his motorbike, sustaining serious injuries in the process, and went into a period of withdrawal while he recuperated. During the late 1960s, Dylan again changed stylistic tradition, moving away from the psychedelic culture of the time. It was then that he recorded The Times They Are A-Changin&#x27;, perhaps more famously recorded by Jimi Hendrix. The 1970s were a period during which Dylan was more sporadic in his output, releasing some poorly received LPs. He rarely appeared in person until 1973, when he began touring again with his backing band The Band. He also wrote one of his most extensively covered songs, Knockin&#x27; On Heaven&#x27;s Door, as well as what is now recognised as one of his best albums Blood On The Tracks. Towards the end of the 1970s, Dylan discovered God, and released some albums of gospel music. He started to talk to the crowd about his faith during his performances, and wouldn&#x27;t play any of his early work, which alienated some of his previous fans. Dylan today still remains an influential and popular artist; despite a period of little note between 1970-2000, his 2006 album Modern Times reached the US chart at #1, as did his 2009 album Together Through Life, in the US, Britain, France and several other countries. His 2012 album Tempest was also critically acclaimed. Since 1988, Dylan has been on the so-called Never Ending Tour, during which his performanes have provoked controversy, with some critics claiming that his lyrics have become incomprehensible, an experience which is not helped by his tendency to change his set-list and vocals almost every performance. Bob Dylan&#x27;s strong influence over the past few years is becoming even more prominent amongst a growing group of younger emerging artists such as George Ellias and Devendra Banhart. Dylan&#x27;s early lyrics incorporated politics, social commentary, philosophy and literary influences, defying existing pop music conventions and appealing widely to the counterculture of the time. While expanding and personalizing musical styles, Dylan has shown steadfast devotion to traditions of American song, from folk and country/blues to rock and roll and rockabilly, to Gaelic balladry, even jazz, swing and Broadway. Dylan performs with the guitar, keyboard and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s. He has also recently performed alongside other iconic artists, such as Paul Simon, Joni Mitchell, Tom Petty and Eric Clapton. Although his contributions as a performer and recording artist have been central to his career, his songwriting is generally held as his highest accomplishment.

Most of Thickfreakness was recorded in about 14 hours in Carney&#x27;s basement, using only an early 80&#x27;s Tascam 388 8-track recorder. Often, their recordings still have background noises (such as an owl hooting). The Black Keys have achieved increasing critical acclaim and recognition since their debut album, which itself received praise from Rolling Stone magazine. Time magazine named them one of the &quot;10 Best Acts of 2003&quot; (behind OutKast and The White Stripes). They have supported a number of bands: they toured with Sleater-Kinney in 2003, had a short stint opening for Beck, have recently opened for Radiohead on the American leg of their brief 2006 tour, and performed at Lollapalooza in 2005 and 2007. In addition to this, they were also well-liked by influential British radio DJ John Peel and appeared on both Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien and The Late Show with David Letterman. Famous followers of the band include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant, Billy Gibbons of ZZ Top, Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead, and Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammet. Matt Helders, drummer for the Arctic Monkeys, can be seen in a Black Keys T-Shirt in an interview on MTV&#x27;s RAW. Their song &quot;When the Lights Go Out&quot; was featured in the 2007 film Black Snake Moan, and also on the soundtrack for that movie. The Black Keys were included in the soundtrack of the 2003 movie School of Rock with their song, &quot;Set You Free&quot;. &quot;Lies&quot; was featured in the conclusion of the February 4, 2009 episode of Lie to Me. One of their songs, &quot;Girl Is on My Mind&quot;, was used in a 2006 Sony Ericsson advertisement, starring the tennis players Ana Ivanovic and Daniela Hantuchova, gaining the band more commercial recognition. It was also used in a 2006 Victoria&#x27;s Secret commercial featuring Heidi Klum and could be heard in the movies Rest Stop and Cashback.

Their cover &quot;Grown So Ugly&quot; can be heard in the background of the going away party in the 2007 film Cloverfield. &quot;Strange Times&quot; is used in Grand Theft Auto IV on the in-game radio station Radio Broker. &quot;Strange Times&quot; can also be heard during a preview for ABC&#x27;s The Mole, and the trailer for season three of the Showtime series Dexter, as well as a promo for Gossip Girl. Their song &quot;Just Got To Be&quot; is used on the soundtrack for the video game NHL 08, and &quot;Hard Row&quot; is featured in the premiere episode of the FX show Sons of Anarchy. Sons of Anarchy has gone on to use &quot;Keep Me&quot; in both Episodes 6 and 7, as well as &quot;Busted&quot; in episode 7. The song &quot;Lies&quot; is featured in the advertising campaign for the third season of HBO&#x27;s Big Love. &quot;The Breaks&quot; can be heard in Guy Ritchie&#x27; film RocknRolla. &quot;Your Touch&quot; can also be heard in the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot; in the episode &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, during the opening scenes. The song &quot;Psychotic Girl&quot; is featured the episode &quot;Messin&#x27; with the Kid&quot; in season 6 of One Tree Hill. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Man&quot; is the opening theme song for the HBO show Hungand was also featured in an episode of the FX Network show Rescue Me. &quot;Your Touch&quot; can also be heard in the film Zombieland and in an episode of &quot;Eastbound and Down&quot; on HBO.

The duo&#x27;s fifth album is the first one recorded in a proper studio. The Band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;Brothers&quot; was released in spring 2010 and has seen increasing amounts of exposure to the &quot;Dancing T-Rex&quot; video for the song &quot;Tighten Up&quot; that went viral&#8230;until the band asked it to be removed because they felt it made light of their music. A proper video was released later in 2010, featuring Dan Auerbach and Pat Carney at a playground and was pushed on the band&#x27;s official YouTube channel, as well as through the iTunes and Zune marketplaces. The track &quot;Tighten Up&quot; was also used as the background music for a Subaru Legacy commercial and on the FIFA 2011 Soundtrack. The Black Keys&#x27; seventh studio album, &quot;El Camino,&quot; was released on the 6th of December 2011. Co-produced by Danger Mouse, the album was released to critical acclaim, receiving positive reviews from The Rolling Stones, NME and more. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly commented on &quot;El Camino&quot;, saying that &quot;El Camino trades the soulful stylings of Brothers for harder-driving, faster-riffing rock &amp; roll&quot;. At the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, El Camino won the award for Best Rock Album, while &quot;Lonely Boy&quot; received multiple honors, taking &#x27;Best Rock Performance&#x27; and &#x27;Best Rock Song&#x27;. The album has sold 1. 4 million copies in the United States to date. The Black Keys&#x27; eighth studio album, Turn Blue, was released on May 12, 2014 to generally favorable reviews. ", "a-ha": "a-ha is a Norwegian new wave band. The trio, composed of lead vocalist Morten Harket, guitarist Paul Waaktaar-Savoy and keyboardist Magne Furuholmen, formed in 1982 and left Oslo, Norway for London in order to make a career in the music business. The origin of the name a-ha comes from the lyric of an early song. After checking dictionaries in several languages, they found out that &#x27;a-ha&#x27; was an international way of expressing recognition, with positive connotations. It was short, a-ha was easy to say and somewhat unusual. The first song to break through into the mainstream culture was Take On Me, which was featured on the album Hunting High And Low ; a main reason for its popularity was the music video that came some time later after the song&#x27;s release. &quot;Take on Me&quot; was the first song Morten Harket heard Magne Furuholmen and Paul Waaktaar-Savoy play. At that time the song was called &quot;Lesson One. &quot; After multiple re-recordings and two failed releases, &quot;Take on Me&quot; became a hit on both sides of the Atlantic in 1985. Although their first release of the song in 1984 was not a major success, it was remixed by producer Alan Tarney a year later, and sold 1. 5 million copies worldwide in one week. Eventually the single &quot;Take on Me&quot; is estimated to have sold 7-9 million copies worldwide; it peaked at number one on the U. S. Billboard Hot 100 and number two in the UK Singles Chart. Sales were aided in the U. S. by a music video on MTV that mimicked the truck chase from Terry Gilliam&#x27;s movie Brazil and the climactic scene from the Ken Russell film Altered States. The video used a sketchy animation / live action combination called &quot;Rotoscoping&quot; that tells a fantasy thriller story to the song. At the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards &quot;Take on Me&quot; won in six categories. It was also nominated for Best Video of the Year at 1986 American Music Awards. The follow-up single to &quot;Take on Me&quot; was &quot;The Sun Always Shines on T. V. &quot;. In the U. S. , the song peaked at number twenty on the Billboard Hot 100 and reached number seventeen on Radio &amp; Records airplay chart. In addition, the music video for the song won in two categories at the 1986 MTV Video Music Awards. a-ha&#x27;s American success culminated in their 1986 Grammy nomination in a coveted Best New Artist category which was eventually won by Sade. &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; turned out to be A-ha&#x27;s last Billboard Top 40 single, and to this day in the United States a-ha is mostly remembered by the general public only because of the singularly huge success of &quot;Take on Me&quot;. Hunting High and Low (1985), which contained &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; and &quot;Take on Me,&quot; was a worldwide bestseller. In the U. S. , it sold more than a million copies and acquired platinum certification by RIAA. As of 2005, Hunting High and Low has sold 8 million copies worldwide. a-ha&#x27;s second album was Scoundrel Days (1986) and represented a move towards alternative rock as synthpop began to fall out of style. In 1987, they provided the title song for the James Bond film The Living Daylights. Stay on These Roads (1988) received more mixed reviews than the previous albums. In spite of a drastic decline in sales in the next few years, a-ha continued to record two more albums, East of the Sun, West of the Moon (1990) and Memorial Beach (1993). East of the Sun, West of the Moon featured a cover version of The Everly Brothers 1963 single, &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot;. Because of apparent internal conflicts between the band members and conflict with the record label at the time, A-ha split in 1994 and their members started focusing on solo activities, but came together in 1994 to perform for the Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. This performance included their song composed for the Winter Paralympics, &quot;Shapes That Go Together&quot;. After a very well-received performance of &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; and a new song, &quot;Summer Moved On&quot;, at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in 1998, the band returned to the studio and recorded 2000&#x27;s Minor Earth Major Sky, which resulted in a new tour, and a videocast performance of a-ha (with Briskeby) opening the new Vallhall stadium in Oslo. Sales of this album and 2002&#x27;s Lifelines showed that their fanbase was still there, and also that they were able to attract new audiences, especially in Central Europe and Scandinavia, where the albums sold extremely well. They appeared again at the Nobel Peace Prize concert in 2001. a-ha&#x27;s music video for the song, &quot;I Wish I Cared&quot; was the first fully web-based animated flash music video to be made available. A live album (from their 2002 tour) with the title How Can I Sleep With Your Voice in My Head? was released in March of 2003, preceded by a live single of the 1986 classic &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot;. In 2004, an in-depth book entitled &quot;The Swing Of Things&quot; was published, also featuring a CD of early demo material. In 2004, a-ha celebrated their twentieth anniversary with the release of a new singles collection: The Definitive Singles Collection 1984-2004 . This compilation brought them back into the UK Top 20 Album Charts, where they reached number thirteen. Over their career, a-ha have officially released 32 singles. 13 of these became top ten singles in the UK, and 14 singles have been number one on the radio lists over the world. The compilation included some of the highlights from a-ha's last 20 years. In September, a-ha returned to the U. S. (at Irving Plaza in New York City) for the band&#x27;s first concert on American soil since 1986. A short impromptu performance of &quot;Take on Me&quot; occurred on September 11 in Times Square. On August 27, 2005, the band played a concert for 120,000 people in Frognerparken in Oslo, the largest concert ever in Norway. On November 4, 2005, the band released its new studio album, Analogue . The first single &quot;Celice&quot; was released on October 4 in mainland Europe. Later that same month, a tour followed, with concerts in Brussels, France, Germany and the UK. The release of the track, &quot;Analogue (All I Want)&quot; followed in the UK in January 2006, giving a-ha its first top ten hit in the UK since 1988. The third single in Europe (second in the UK) from the album was the Magne Furuholmen penned &quot;Cosy Prisons&quot;, already a live-staple in the band&#x27;s set. On the 30 October 2006 in London a-ha received the prestigious Q Inspiration Award for its long contribution to music and for inspiring many of their younger colleagues in the business. In 2007 a-ha recorded a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;#9 Dream&quot; for Amnesty International. A ninth studio album, Foot Of The Mountain , was released in the summer of 2009. This more synth oriented album got a number five position in the UK in August 2009, and was No. 11 on the European album charts. &quot;Norway&#x27;s most successful band through the years is splitting up for good! After 9 studio albums with over 35 million albums sold, it`s over for the band. &quot; A-ha had a press conference in Cologne 26. 10. 09, the day before their last world tour kick-off in Lanxess Arena. The last concert was in Oslo Norway. The concert ion 4 December 2010 at the Oslo Spektrum. On March 21, 2015, it was confirmed in national Norwegian newspapers that a-ha has reunited for a two-year period and are currently writing new material. a-ha&#x27;s tenth studio album, Cast in Steel, is scheduled to be released on September 4, 2015. Photo galleries and additional information can be viewed at the official site, www. a-ha. com . ", "Rammstein": "Rammstein is a German metal band which was formed in 1994, in Berlin, and consists of Till Lindemann (lead vocals), Richard Kruspe (lead guitar and backing vocals), Paul Landers (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Oliver Riedel (bass guitar, &quot;Ollie&quot;), Christoph Schneider (drums and Electronic percussion, &quot;Doom&quot;) and Christian Lorenz (keyboards, &quot;Flake&quot;). The band is widely accepted as part of the Neue Deutsche Harte scene, alongside bands such as Oomph!, Laibach, and Die Krupps. Their songs are performed almost exclusively in German. They have sold over 22 million records worldwide. Rammstein&#x27;s entire catalogue is published by Universal Music Group. Since its formation, Rammstein has had no changes in lineup. Although the majority of their songs are written in German, Rammstein has had success across the world. Name Rammstein takes its name indirectly from the West German town of Ramstein-Miesenbach, the site of the flight show disaster on August 28, 1988. The band&#x27;s signature song, the eponymous Rammstein, is a commemoration of the tragedy that took place at the Ramstein Air Base. The extra &quot;m&quot; in the band&#x27;s name makes it translate literally as &quot;ramming stone&quot; to convey the Teutonic sound of their music. In a short period before the band became well known, they performed using the name &quot;Rammstein-Flugschau&quot; (literally meaning Rammstein-Airshow. ) Formation Rammstein was founded by guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band, Orgasm Death Gimmick. At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially that of Kiss. After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin where Till Lindemann worked as a basket weaver and played drums in the band First Arsch (loosely translated as &quot;Apex Ass&quot;). At this time, Richard lived with Oliver Riedel, of the band The Inchtabokatables, and Christoph &quot;Doom&quot; Schneider (of Die Firma). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him. He envisioned something that would combine machines as well as the sound of hard guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he persuaded Lindemann to join Rammstein. Richard first discovered Till when he overheard him singing while he was working. Early Years (Pre-Herzeleid Era - 1994) A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four track demo CD in a professional studio. Kruspe, Schneider, Riedel, and Lindemann entered and won the contest, which sparked the attention of Paul Landers, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein then attempted to recruit Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz, who had played with Paul Landers previously in Feeling B. At first, Lorenz was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join the band. Herzeleid (1995 - 1997) Rammstein began to record their first studio album entitled Herzeleid in March 1995 with producer Jacob Hellner. They released their first single Du riechst so gut on August 17th and later released the album on September 24th 1995. Later that same year, they toured with Clawfinger in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a tour of their own through Germany from December 2nd to December 22nd consisting of 17 shows which helped to boost the band&#x27;s popularity. They then went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single entitled Seemann on January 8th 1996. On March 27, Rammstein performed on MTV&#x27;s Hanging Out in London; their first performance in the UK. Rammstein&#x27;s first major boost in popularity outside of Germany came when music director Trent Reznor chose two Rammstein songs, namely Heirate Mich and Rammstein, for David Lynch&#x27;s new film, Lost Highway. The soundtrack for the movie was released in the US in the fall of 1996 and later in Europe April 1997. Rammstein then went on to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland from September to October 1996, doing an anniversary concert on 27th September called &#x27;100 years of Rammstein&#x27;. Guests to the concert included Moby, Christiane Herbold (of Bobo) and The Berlin Session Orchestra, Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show. Sehnsucht/Live aus Berlin (late 1996 - 2000) Rammstein started recording Sehnsucht in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. The first single off the album, entitled Engel was released on April 1 1997 and later reached gold on May 23. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, appropriately named Engel: Fan Edition. This contained two previously unreleased songs Feuerrader and Wilder Wein. Release of the 2nd single off the album &quot;Sehnsucht&quot; was Du Hast which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer whilst Sehnsucht was released on August 22nd 1997. The album reached number 1 after only two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both the singles off Sehnsucht (Du Hast and Engel) were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold out shows throughout Europe in September, October and November 1997 before releasing their cover of the Kraftwerk song, Das Modell. The single included another unreleased song entitled Kokain. On December 5th 1997, Rammstein embarked on their first tour of the United States, with support from KMFDM. On August 22nd and 23rd 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band have ever played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally videotaped, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, Live aus Berlin. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values tour in September through to late October 1998. To further continue their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status on November 2nd. The Band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed Du Hast live on November 12th of that year. Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 42nd-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the Live aus Berlin concert was released on CD on 30th August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, Live aus Berlin went to number one in the German Album Charts. On September 13th and November 26th 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively. Mutter (2000 - 2002) Rammstein&#x27;s album Mutter recording took place in the south of France between May 2000 and June 2000, and was later mixed in Stockholm in October of that year. During the Christmas holidays 2000, Rammstein released an MP3 of Links 2 3 4 as a taster for their new album. 2001 was a busy year for Rammstein, starting out in January and February with the band playing the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand. January also heralded the shooting of the video for their upcoming single Sonne, recorded in Potsdam at Babelsberger Filmstudios from 13th to the 15th. The video was released on 29th January 2001. The single for Sonne was released on February 12th 2001 in Europe, featuring an Instrumental version of the song, two remixes by Clawfinger, and Adios off the upcoming album. Mutter was released on April 2nd 2001, sparking another Rammstein tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. On May 14th, the second single off the album Links 2 3 4 was released, along with a video of the single on May 18th. After a tour throughout Europe in June, the band then toured USA, Canada and Mexico from June 2001 to August 2001. Ich Will, the third single from the album was released on September 10th 2001 and a Tour edition of the Mutter album was released, featuring alternative artwork and live versions of Ich Will, Links 2 3 4, Sonne, and Spieluhr. Between January 8th and January 12th 2002, Rammstein travelled to Prague to participate in a minor scene from the movie &#x27;xXx&#x27;. The band is seen in the opening scene of the action movie performing a concert with their song Feuer frei!. Feuer frei! was released across Europe as first single from the xXx Soundtrack on 14th October 2002. Rammstein released two remixes of the song, Furthermore, the single&#x27;s tracklisting included Du Hast and Buck Dich cover versions by Battery. The single cover was an artwork by New York artist Robert Longo. The video for the single was cut by Rob Cohen, which is partly the Rammstein performance at the beginning of the movie and partly snippets from the movie itself. Reise, Reise (2003 - 2005) Rammstein recorded Reise, Reise at the El Cortijo studio in southern Spain between November 2003 and December 2003, it was later mixed at Toytown studio in Stockholm, Sweden in April and May 2004. The first single off of the album was Mein Teil, released on 26th July 2004. The shooting for the video is shot in the Arena, in the Treptow district of Berlin. Outdoor shooting takes place at the Deutsche Oper (Opera House) U-Bahn station on Bismarckstrasse. The director is Zoran Bihac, who was also behind the Links 2 3 4 video. The Amerika video is filmed on the 6th and 7th of August 2004 in the ruins of the former chemical factory in Rudersdorf near Berlin, Germany under the direction of Jorn Heitmann (who also directed the Ich will video, among others). The spacesuits for the moon scenes were borrowed from Hollywood and 240 tons of ash was needed to create the moon landscape. The video premiered on 20th August 2004. The second single from Reise, Reise was Amerika, released on September 13th 2004. With the album released on September 27th, it went straight to top 10 charts throughout Europe.

On February 19th 2006, Rammstein had the honour of having an asteroid named after them, 110393 Rammstein. Some believe their name was chosen because of the music video for Amerika, which displayed the six members of the band floating above the moon sporting NASA&#x27;s astronaut suits. On November 17th the first Rammstein Live DVD since Live aus Berlin from 1998 is released. Volkerball shows concert-performances by the band in England, France, Japan and Russia.

The Photo-book edition contains 2 DVDs and 2 Live albums. Liebe ist fur alle da &amp; Tour (2007-2011) The band took a time out in 2006, and began work again in 2007. The band didn&#x27;t tour during 2007 due to album production. The recording process took reportedly two years. In July 2009, the title track &quot;Liebe ist fur alle da&quot; leaked onto the internet, along with promotional materials. This has led Universal Music to take action against certain fan sites. The single &quot;Pussy&quot; was released on September 16, 2009, especially for the adult website Visit-x. The video contains graphic scenes of male and female nudity as well as women engaging in sexual activity with the band members, although the actual sex scenes were performed by body doubles. The women featured in the video are German porn stars. The album Liebe ist fur alle da was released October 16. On November 8, 2009 Rammstein began the first leg of the Liebe ist fur alle da Tour In Lisbon, Portugal. The video to &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot; was released on December 21, 2009 on the adult website Visit-x, just like the video to &quot;Pussy&quot;, after advertisement on the band&#x27;s official German website; it depicts the band on stage in a similar configuration as the one on their 2009/10 tour. Any references to the video on the official website have since been deleted. The single has been released on January 15, 2010. On April 23, 2010, Rammstein released their video &quot;Haifisch&quot;. Unlike the video to &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot;, it contains more of a storyline rather than a performance. The single was released during May and June 2010. As part of their European summer tour, Rammstein performed at the 2010 Rock AM Ring Festival on Friday 4th - Sunday 6 June 2010. They also headlined several shows across Europe on the Sonisphere Festival, including their first ever outdoor UK performance at Knebworth Park, performing the day before Iron Maiden. On Sunday July 18, 2010, Rammstein played in front of more than 130,000 people in Quebec City on the Plains of Abraham as the closing show for the Festival d&#x27;ete de Quebec. It was their first North American appearance in 9 years. The band have confirmed that their last tour dates of 2010 will be in the Americas. After several South American dates the band will perform a show at the famous Madison Square Garden in New York- their first US show in nine years, Tickets sold out within 30 minutes of being on sale. It is also confirmed that they will be playing at Big Day Out 2011 in Australia and New Zealand. Made In Germany 1995-2011 (2011-present) On November 11, 2011 Rammstein released the single &quot;Mein Land&quot;, on December 2 the album &quot;Made in Germany 1995-2011&quot;. Style Although Rammstein is often generalized as Neue Deutsche Harte, its music spans a variety of related styles, including industrial hard rock, heavy metal and electronic music with influences of punk rock, pop music and gothic rock, due to their use of keyboards to emulate strings, choirs or pianos. The band was influenced by Laibach, a Slovenian neo-classical and industrial group. Other influences include, Oomph!, and Ministry, but the contrast between individual songs such as Du riechst so gut, Bestrafe mich, Ohne dich and Te quiero puta! makes the band difficult to classify, though most simply refer to them as industrial metal. The band&#x27;s diverse range of influence has made them appealing to tastes of all kinds, but they are chiefly renowned in industrial, electronica, and heavy metal circles. The band has a flair for costumes of all sorts, both in live shows and in videos. In the Keine Lust video, all members of the band except Flake were dressed in fat suits. In the Amerika video, all members of the band wore space suits. Live, the band experiments even more with costumes. In the Volkerball concert, among others, Till would change constumes in between songs, dressed accordingly for each song. For example, in Mein Teil, he was dressed as a butcher, in Reise, Reise, a sailor. The rest of the band each wears their own preferred costume, but none as outlandish or themed as Till&#x27;s. Rammstein&#x27;s style has tended to divide critics, some of whom have responded with memorable comments. Jam Showbiz (April 2001) described Mutter as &quot;music to invade Poland to. &quot; New Zealand&#x27;s Southland Times (Dec. 17, 1999) suggested that Till Lindemann&#x27;s &quot;booming, sub-sonic voice&quot; would send &quot;the peasants fleeing into their barns and bolting their doors,&quot; while the New York Times (Jan. 9, 2005) commented that on the stage, &quot;Mr. Lindemann gave off an air of such brute masculinity and barely contained violence that it seemed that he could have reached into the crowd, snatched up a fan, and bitten off his head. &quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic commented that &quot;their blend of industrial noise, grinding metal guitars, and operatic vocals is staggeringly powerful. &quot; &quot;We just push boundaries,&quot; said Till Lindemann in an interview with rock magazine Kerrang!. &quot;We can&#x27;t help it if people don&#x27;t like those boundaries being pushed. &quot; Lyrics Nearly all of Rammstein&#x27;s songs are in German. However, the band did record Engel (English version) (Angel), Du hast (English version) (&quot;You have&quot;, which is most commonly confused with &quot;You hate&quot;, since &#x27;hast&#x27; and &#x27;hasst&#x27; sound phonetically identical. In the English version of the song, the lyric is translated to &quot;You hate&quot; for stylization purposes. ), and Amerika (English version), as well as covers of the songs Stripped (Depeche Mode) and Pet Sematary (The Ramones). In addition, the songs Amerika, Stirb nicht vor mir (Don&#x27;t Die Before I Do) and Moskau (&quot;Moscow&quot;) contain not only German verses, but also English and Russian choruses, respectively; Te quiero puta! (&quot;I love you, whore!&quot;) is entirely in Spanish. Oliver Riedel commented that, &quot;German language suits heavy metal music. French might be the language of love, but German is the language of anger&quot;. The lyrics of Rammstein and above all their talk by singer Till Lindemann are an essential element of music and shape the perception by fans and a wider public. This is, among other things that are often very controversial, and taboo subjects such as sadomasochism (Buck Dich, Rein Raus and Bestrafe Mich), homosexuality (Mann gegen Mann), incest (Spiel mit mir and Tier), pedophilia (Tier and Halleluja) , Necrophilia (Heirate mich), Pyromania (Benzin and Hilf mir), cannibalism (Mein Teil), the game with religious images (Asche zu Asche, Engel) having sex and violence (Wollt ihr das Bett in Flammen sehen?). Wordplay is a fundamental component of Rammstein&#x27;s lyrics. In many instances, the lyrics are phrased such that they can be interpreted in several ways. The song Du hast, for example, is a play on German marriage vows (Willst Du, bis der Tod euch scheidet, treu ihr sein fur alle Tage? - &quot;Will you, until Death separates you, be faithful to her for the rest of your days?&quot;). In the song, the traditional affirmative response, Ja (&quot;Yes&quot;), is replaced by its negation Nein (&quot;No&quot;). The final repetition of this line further perverts the meaning of the original vows through a minor change in the wording Willst Du, bis zum Tod der Scheide &#8230; (Will you, until the Death of the vagina &#8230;). The song starts, in fact, with a play on words: Du&#8230; Du hast&#8230; Du hast mich&#8230; meaning &quot;You have me&quot;. This line is often mistaken for &quot;You hate me&quot;, because in German, there is no clear distinction between the pronunciation of Du hasst which means &quot;you hate&quot; and Du hast which means &quot;you have&quot;. The word game is later resolved as the line is completed; Du hast mich gefragt (&quot;You asked me&quot;). Confusingly, the band did also make an English version of the song named You hate which was not translated directly from Du hast. While many arguments about &#x27;Du Hast&#x27; are around, it is known that Rammstein used this wording to mislead and create humour in the song. It was a play with the pronunciation of words, causing many non-native speakers of German to be confused. Live Performances Rammstein has achieved particular fame (not to mention notoriety) for its hugely over-the-top stage show, using so many pyrotechnics that fans eventually coined the motto &quot;Other bands play, Rammstein burns!&quot; (a quip at Manowar&#x27;s song &quot;Kings of Metal&quot;, which states, &quot;other bands play, Manowar kill&quot;). After an accident in the Arena in Berlin where some burning decoration parts fell on the audience (September 27, 1996) the band took to employing professionals to handle the pyrotechnics; Lindemann himself is now a licensed pyrotechnician who spends entire songs engulfed head-to-toe in flames. He has suffered multiple burns on his ears, his hair and his arms. The heat is so intense that on occasion, people have been carried out of Rammstein concerts suffering from heat exhaustion, and lighting gantries have been seen glowing red-hot from repeated fireball hits. The variety of the pyrotechnics can be seen in a recent concert playlist, which includes such items as &quot;Lycopodium Masks&quot;, &quot;Glitterburst Truss&quot;, &quot;Pyrostrobes&quot;, &quot;Comets&quot;, &quot;Flash Trays&quot; and &quot;Mortar Hits&quot;. The band&#x27;s costumes are equally outlandish. During the Reise, Reise tour they were wearing Lederhosen, corsets and vague military uniforms with steel helmets, while during the Mutter tour the group kept to the themes of the album artwork and descended onto the stage from a giant uterus while wearing diapers. According to Kruspe, the on-stage wackiness is entirely deliberate (Rammstein&#x27;s motto according to Schneider is: &quot;Do your own thing. And overdo it!&quot;). The aim is to get people&#x27;s attention and have fun at the same time: &quot;You have to understand that 99 percent of the people don&#x27;t understand the lyrics, so you have to come up with something to keep the drama in the show. We have to do something. We like to have a show; we like to play with fire. We do have a sense of humor. We do laugh about it; we have fun&#8230; but we&#x27;re not Spinal Tap. We take the music and the lyrics seriously. It&#x27;s a combination of humor, theater and our East German culture, you know?&quot; Their onstage antics have led them to trouble as well. During their stint on the American Family Values Tour 1998, alongside acts such as rapper Ice Cube, Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Orgy, the band was arrested for indecency. In one of the more infamous moments, Rammstein&#x27;s vocalist, Till Lindemann engaged in simulated sodomy with the keyboardist, Christian Lorenz, during their performance of &quot;Buck dich&quot; in Worcester, Massachusetts. They were subsequently arrested and fined $25 and spent the night in jail. The band attempted to appeal the fine, but spent more in legal fees and court fees than the $25 fine. Covers and Adaptations Rammstein&#x27;s songs have been covered by a number of other artists, These include:  * Engel : The group Gregorian reworked Engel as a Gregorian chant for their album The Dark Side. The same song has been covered by Belgian girls choir Scala &amp; Kolacny Brothers, resulting in a very quiet, brooding version; contrary to the original. The Chilean aggrotech/industrial metal band Vigilante also covered this song on their 2008 remix album.  * Mein Herz brennt : The German composer Torsten Rasch has produced a classical symphonic song-cycle entitled Mein Herz brennt (&quot;My heart burns&quot;), based on the music of Rammstein.  * Seemann : by Nina Hagen and Apocalyptica. This cover impressed Rammstein so much that they took Apocalyptica as co-headliner on tour with them in Spring 2005, and invited the band on stage to perform &quot;Ohne dich&quot; (&quot;Without you&quot;) and &quot;Mein Herz brennt&quot; (&quot;My Heart burns&quot;) together. The &quot;Benzin&quot; single also featured a remix of the song, called Kerosiini by Apocalyptica.  * Ohne dich : by Laibach.  * Weisses Fleisch : by the German death metal band Debauchery covered the song for their Back In Blood album.  * &quot;Mein Teil&quot; : A bluegrass version appears as a bonus track on the band Hayseed Dixie&#x27;s 2007 album Weapons of Grass Destruction. Rammstein has also done several covers themselves, including Das Modell (&quot;The model&quot;) by Kraftwerk, &quot;Stripped&quot; by Depeche Mode and &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; by Ramones (sung by keyboardist Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz). A cover version of Schtiel (&quot;Calm&quot;) by Aria (Ariia) was released by Till Lindemann &amp; Richard Kruspe as a side project, due to disagreement with Universal records label. It was recently announced that the German pop singer Nena, author of 99 Luftballons (&quot;99 Air Balloons&quot;), will be doing an album of covers named Cover Me in which it will feature a Rammstein cover of the song Ein Lied. Till Lindemann appears as a guest singer along with Richard Kruspe on guitar on the Apocalyptica album Worlds Collide. They took on David Bowie&#x27;s song Heroes, which was released in German as Helden. Lindemann sings the German version, making his song the only German-language song on Worlds Collide. Rammstein singles traditionally also have a great quantity of remixes, particularly often from Clawfinger and Meshuggah. Controversies  Imagery Described by the New York Times as a &quot;powerful strain of brutally intense rock&quot; who &quot;bring gale-force music and spectacular theatrics together&quot;, Rammstein has been a band with a highly controversy-prone nature. Rammstein have not been shy about courting this controversy and have periodically attracted condemnation from morality campaigners. Their stage act earned them a night in jail in June 1999 after a liquid-ejecting dildo was used in a concert in Worcester, Massachusetts. Back home in Germany, the band has faced repeated accusations of fascist sympathies due to the dark and sometimes militaristic imagery of their videos and concerts, including the use of excerpts from the film Olympia by Leni Riefenstahl in the video for Stripped. Their debut album Herzeleid, released in Germany in 1995, originally had a cover featuring the band members&#x27; upper bodies without clothing; critics accused the band of trying to sell themselves as &quot;poster boys for the Master Race&quot;. Rammstein have vigorously denied this and said that they want nothing to do with politics or supremacy of any kind. Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz, annoyed by the claim, has remarked that it&#x27;s just a photo, and should be understood as such. Herzeleid has since been given an alternate cover in the United States, depicting the band members&#x27; faces. The song Links 2 3 4 (Links being German for &quot;left&quot;) was written as a riposte to these claims. According to Kruspe, it means, &quot;&#x27;My heart beats on the left, two, three, four&#x27;. It&#x27;s simple. If you want to put us in a political category, we&#x27;re on the left side, and that&#x27;s the reason we made the song&quot;. On the other hand, this is also an allusion to a military marching cadence since &quot;Links, 2, 3, 4&quot; is typically heard during marching practice in the German army with &quot;links&quot; referring to the left foot. The song is also a reference to the saying &quot;the heart beats left&quot;, repeatedly used by Oskar Lafontaine, in 2001 a famous member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany), now leader of the Left Party (Die Linke), and almost the title of a book written by him (the title is Das Herz schlagt links instead of Mein Herz schlagt links - &quot;The heart beats left&quot; instead of &quot;My Heart beats left&quot;). . According to the German online music magazine Rammstein, through this song, positioned themselves on the side of Oskar Lafontaine. They write:  Rammstein binden den Lafontaine-Spruch &quot;Mein Herz schlagt links&quot; in ihren Text ein und zitieren eine Zeile aus einem alten Hannes Wader-Arbeitersong (&quot;Links, zwo, drei, vier; links, zwo, drei, vier; wo dein Platz Genosse ist, reih Dich ein in die Arbeitereinheitsfront, wenn Du auch ein Arbeiter bist&quot;). (Rammstein embed the Lafontaine saying My heart beats left into their lyric and cite a line of an old Hannes Wader workers&#x27; song (&quot;Left, 2, 3, 4; left 2, 3, 4; where your place is comrade, line up into the Workers&#x27; United Front, if you are a worker&quot;). ) Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz recently stated on an on-line chat that the song was created in order to show that the band could write a harsh, &quot;evil&quot;, military-sounding song that was not about Nazi ideals. Relation To Violent Events Rammstein were cited in relation to the Columbine High School Massacre in 1999, when photos of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold wearing Rammstein T-shirts were revealed. Though there was no evidence to correlate the two events, the band felt obliged to issue a statement:  &quot;The members of Rammstein express their condolences and sympathy to all affected by the recent tragic events in Denver. They wish to make it clear that they have no lyrical content or political beliefs that could have possibly influenced such behaviour. Additionally, members of Rammstein have children of their own, in whom they continually strive to instill healthy and non-violent values&quot;. Coincidentally, on September 10, 2001 the single and video clip of Ich will (&quot;I Want&quot;) was released which portrays the band as terrorists who want to get a message across and receiving a kind of terrorist award for their &quot;actions&quot;. In the United States the video clip was broadcast only late at night after the attacks of September 11, 2001 in New York City although many media officials and politicians requested the video to be pulled from broadcast completely. Following the tragic conclusion of the Beslan school hostage crisis in Russia in September 2004, the Russian authorities claimed that the terrorists had &quot;listened to German hard rock group Rammstein on personal stereos during the siege to keep themselves edgy and fired up&quot;. The claim has not been independently confirmed. Band members said this about the issue:  &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of talk about that, but if there are radical feelings in people anything can wake them - a painting, a picture, whatever. It&#x27;s just a coincidence that it happened to be our music. It&#x27;s important to think about what caused them to make their decisions, how they became animals, not their taste in music. Whenever something like this happens it&#x27;s like &#x27;Okay, let&#x27;s blame the artist&#x27;. Such bullshit. (Till Lindemann).  &quot;Our music is made to release aggression, and people listening to it are also needed to do that, but it&#x27;s not our fault. Should we stop making hard music because bad people might like it?&quot; (Christoph &quot;Doom&quot; Schneider). Pekka-Erik Auvinen, the perpetrator of the Jokela school shooting in November 2007 also included Rammstein in one of his favourite bands. He noted though that, the music among other things was not to blame for his decisions. Videos In October 2004, the video for Mein Teil (&quot;My part&quot;) caused considerable controversy in Germany when it was released. It takes a darkly comic view of the Armin Meiwes cannibalism case, showing a cross dressed Schneider holding the other 5 band members on a leash and rolling around in mud. The controversy did nothing to stop (and may even have helped) the single rising to No. 2 in the German charts. Meiwes (who was convicted of manslaughter in 2004, then retried in 2006 and found guilty of murder) brought suit in January 2006 against the band for infringement of rights to the story. The outcome resulted in a loss for the band of $5. 5 million. The band&#x27;s own views of its image are sanguine: &quot;We like being on the fringes of bad taste&quot;, according to Paul H. Landers, while Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz comments &quot;The controversy is fun, like stealing forbidden fruit. But it serves a purpose. We like audiences to grapple with our music, and people have become more receptive&quot;. Not all of Rammstein&#x27;s videos feature excess and pushing the limits of conventional taste. The video of Ohne Dich (&quot;Without You&quot;) from Reise, Reise can only be described as lushly filmed and touchingly melancholy. The video for Mann gegen Mann (&quot;Man against man&quot;) from their studio album Rosenrot may have caused some controversy, as most of the band members are naked in the video. The lead singer Till Lindemann is wearing what can best be described as a &quot;latex panties&quot; - most likely because he does not have an instrument with which to cover his genitalia. In addition, there are multiple naked men in the video, with clearly visible buttocks, though genitalia could be seen at 32 seconds into the video on Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz through the arm of the guitarist (Richard Z. Krupse) and below the keyboard. He is wearing a flesh-colored thong to prevent this. The video has been played uncensored on MTV. The video has been rated FSK 16 in Germany and therefore can be played on television only after 10pm. The first single from Liebe ist fur alle da, &quot;Pussy&quot;, shows body doubles of the band members having sex in the uncensored version of the music video. Discography  * 1995: Herzeleid  * 1997: Sehnsucht  * 2001: Mutter  * 2004: Reise, Reise  * 2005: Rosenrot  * 2009: Liebe ist fur alle da  * 2011: Made in Germany", "Iron Maiden": "There are multiple artists with this name: 1) Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, east London, in 1975 by bassist and primary songwriter Steve Harris. The band&#x27;s discography has grown to thirty-seven albums, including fifteen studio albums, eleven live albums, four EPs, and seven compilations. Pioneers of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, Iron Maiden achieved initial success during the early 1980s. After several line-up changes, the band went on to release a series of US and UK platinum and gold albums, including 1982&#x27;s The Number of the Beast, 1983&#x27;s Piece of Mind, 1984&#x27;s Powerslave, 1985&#x27;s live release Live After Death , 1986&#x27;s Somewhere in Time and 1988&#x27;s Seventh Son of a Seventh Son. Since the return of lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith in 1999, the band have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with their latest studio offering, The Final Frontier, peaking at No. 1 in 28 different countries and receiving widespread critical acclaim. Despite little radio or television support, Iron Maiden are considered one of the most successful heavy metal bands in history, with The New York Times reporting in 2010 that they have sold over 85 million records worldwide. The band won the Ivor Novello Award for international achievement in 2002. As of October 2013, the band have played over 2000 live shows throughout their career. For the past 35 years, the band have been supported by their famous mascot, &quot;Eddie&quot;, who has appeared on almost all of their album and single covers, as well as in their live shows. The band has changed their line-up several times up to 1999 when Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith returned to the band. Their current line-up is: Steve Harris (1975-): bass, backing vocals, studio keyboards David Michael Murray (1975-): guitar Paul Bruce Dickinson (1981-1993 1999-): lead vocals (see also Bruce Dickinson, Samson) Nicko McBrain (1983-): drums, percussion (see also Trust) Janick Gers (1990-): guitar (see also Bruce Dickinson, White Spirit) Adrian Smith (1980-1990, 1999-): guitar, backing vocals (see also Bruce Dickinson and Psycho Motel). Former members: Doug Sampson - drums, percussion (1977-1979) Dennis Stratton - guitars, backing vocals (1979-1980) Paul Di&#x27;Anno - lead vocals (1978-1981) Clive Burr - drums, percussion (1979-1982) Blaze Bayley - lead vocals (1994-1998) Dennis Wilcock - lead vocals (1976-1977) Barry Purkis - drums, percussion (1977) Paul Day - lead vocals (1975-1976). Iron Maiden&#x27;s work has inspired other sub-genres of heavy metal, including power metal and speed metal, and is generally thought of as an influence to any &quot;metal&quot; music containing dual-guitar harmonization. One example of their far reaching influence is that many bands from virtually every rock and metal sub-genre list Iron Maiden as one of their influences. Many of the band&#x27;s songs are based on history, folklore, movies and books, such as Aces High, Brave New World, The Trooper, The Clansman, The Wicker Man, The Prisoner, Where Eagles Dare, Out of the Silent Planet, To Tame a Land(based on Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune ) and Rime of the Ancient Mariner - in which words from the Samuel Taylor Coleridge poem are incorporated into the song. http://www. ironmaiden. com/ 2) Iron Maiden (later aka The Bolton Iron Maiden) is a late sixties doom-band. This Iron Maiden was formed in 1964 by Barry Skeels, Steve Drewett, Chris Rose and Alan Hooker as an acoustic band in Basildon, Essex that eventually evolved into a band called Iron Maiden. By 1966, the lineup was Skeels (bass), Drewett (vocals/harmonies), Rose (lead guitar), Tom Loates (rhythm guitar) and Stan Gillem (drums); they played Rolling Stones and blues numbers under the name &quot;Growth&quot;. Reduced to a two-piece, Drewett and Skeels played blues under the name of &quot;Stevenson&#x27;s Blues Department&quot; in pubs and clubs in Essex and London. They supported a number of up and coming bands including Jethro Tull, Fleetwood Mac, The Groundhogs and King Crimson. In 1968, Drewett and Skeels were joined by Paul Reynolds (drums) and Trevor Thoms (guitar). They released an acetate (God of Darkness/Ballad of Martha Kent) under the then risque name of BUM. When they signed to the Gemini label in 1970, the name was changed to the less risque Iron Maiden. They recorded their debut album Maiden Voyage. Reynolds was replaced by Steve Chapman on drums and Iron Maiden released the single Ned Kelly/Falling. This coincided with Mick Jagger&#x27;s film &quot;Ned Kelly&quot;. A planned Australian tour fell through. The Gemini record label also folded (with the loss of the debut album master tapes) and Skeels left Iron Maiden. The band carried on without him for a while, but the debut album was not released until 1998 using duplicate tapes owned by Skeels. This &quot;original&quot; Iron Maiden is often considered by fans as one of the earliest &#x27;true&#x27; doom metal bands. However, soon after the &quot;original&quot; Iron Maiden was re-discovered , their name was officially changed to &#x27;The Bolton Iron Maiden&#x27; since the Iron Maiden led by Steve Harris already had the name &#x27;Iron Maiden&#x27; trademarked. ", "White Shoes & The Couples Company": "In August 2002, in an art university in central Jakarta, two lovers from the fine art faculty Rio &amp; Sari decided to form a band together with their confidant in the faculty named Saleh. This was the first formation of White Shoes &amp; The Couples Company, which features Sari in vocal &amp; violin, Rio in rhythm guitar and Saleh on melody guitar. The three of them made their first debut in this formation in a college event. However, the trio formation diverged from their original plan where actually Sari and Rio had keenly asked a married couple from the music faculty to join the band the couple was Ricky Surya Virgana &amp; Mela Virgana. Yet the couple was hard to meet since they were busy lecturing and covering for orchestras. Several months later, the couple eventually joined White Shoes &amp; The Couples Company with Ricky on Bass and cello and Mella in viola, keyboards and piano. The first song of white shoes &amp; The Couples Company was \"Runaway Song\" written by Sari &amp; Rio. The next one was \"Windu &amp; Defrina\", followed by \"Sunday Memory Lane\" and \"Nothing To Fear\". The Band's acquaintance with its current manager Indra Ameng was another story. Indra Ameng was then already a well-known manager. Previously he was the manager of an old famous band in the 1990's called Rumahsakit. Nevertheless, White Shoes &amp; The Couples Company and Indra Ameng did not meet in the world of music, but the world of visual art. This was because Indra Ameng happened to be a visual artist and a program coordinator in an artist initiative space called ruangrupa. At the beginning, White Shoes &amp; The Couples Company did not have a drummer. Thus, Ricky initiated to ask a friend at his faculty namely john Navid a. k. a Lau Kun Sin for position of additional drummer. However, as the time went by and according to necessities, John eventually became a permanent drummer in 2004. Thus, the final formation of White Shoes &amp; The Couples Company was set up. White Shoes &amp; The Couples Company recorded their debut album comprising 11 songs under Aksara Records company. This Album, available in CD and cassette, was launched by Aksara Records and distribute by Universal Music Indonesia.

", "Arctic Monkeys": "Arctic Monkeys are an indie rock band formed in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England in 2002 after meeting at Stocksbridge High School. The band consists of Alex Turner (vocals, guitar), Jamie Cook (guitar), Nick O&#x27;Malley (backing vocals, bass) and Matt Helders (drums, vocals). Founding bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006. The band has released five studio albums, &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; (2006), &quot;Favourite Worst Nightmare&quot; (2007), &quot;Humbug&quot; (2009), &quot;Suck It and See&quot; (2011) and &quot;AM&quot; (2013), all of which debuted at #1 on the UK Albums Chart. Each of the band&#x27;s first five singles I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor, When the Sun Goes Down, Leave Before The Lights Come On, Brianstorm and Fluorescent Adolescent hit the UK Top Five, but their sixth single, Teddy Picker, only went Top 20 and their seventh single, Crying Lightning peaked at #12. The band&#x27;s rise to success started in late 2004/early 2005 when demo songs which had been handed out in CD form at gigs found their way onto the internet. These demos rapidly spread among message boards and friends leading to a growing fan base for the band, and were collected on the unofficial Beneath the Boardwalk , which the band recognizes on their website. The band owe much of their success to viral buzz via the Internet, and have eschewed typical &#x27;commercial&#x27; channels, including refusing to appear on the UK&#x27;s (now discontinued) Top Of The Pops music program, which was often seen as a gateway to success. The band&#x27;s debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not , held the record for the largest first week sales of a debut album in the UK (in its first week, it sold more than the rest of the Top 20 albums combined). The album sold over 360,000 copies in its first week, but lost the title in November 2007 to Leona Lewis&#x27;s album Spirit. On 19th June 2006 the band officially announced that founding member Andy Nicholson had left the band after missing the American leg of their tour due to &#x27;fatigue&#x27; and the other band members couldn&#x27;t stand the constant &#x27;missing his girlfriend syndrome&#x27; so told him to sling his hook. Former Dodgems bassist, Nick O&#x27;Malley was initially brought in as a stand-in, and played the band&#x27;s remaining summer commitments. He was then announced as Nicholson&#x27;s permanent replacement. The single Leave Before The Lights Come On came out on August 14th, but only reached Number 4 on the UK charts, denying the band a third consecutive number 1 single. Their debut album &quot;Whatever People Say I Am, That&#x27;s What I&#x27;m Not&quot; won the 2006 Mercury Prize, was chosen as the best album of year 2006 by Q Magazine, and received a slew of other accolades. Their second album Favourite Worst Nightmare was released on April 23rd 2007. It was preceded by &quot;Brianstorm&quot;, the first single from the album, which was released a week before. Like its predecessor, &quot;Favourite Worst Nightmare&quot; sold more than the rest of the Top 20 combined, and - due to an error on iTunes - every song on the record appeared on the UK Top 200 Singles the next week. When asked about Favourite Worst Nightmare Alex Turner commented, &quot;We haven&#x27;t changed that much. It&#x27;s still about making contact with girls or not making contact with girls&quot;. The band began to write and record demos for the third album in January 2008, Turner said &quot;We had tunes that we&#x27;d already been playing on tour so we recorded them. That's six . We're going to take it easy and start practicing over the summer and doing new stuff. &quot; The band premiered new material from the unreleased album during their January 2009 tour of New Zealand, playing small venues in Wellington and Auckland ahead of the Big Day Out festival. Their first show in more than a year was on January 13, 2009 at Wellington&#x27;s Town Hall. In both cities, the new songs played were &quot;Crying Lightning&quot;, &quot;Go-Kart&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Animals&quot; and &quot;Pretty Visitors. &quot; The full set list from the Auckland gig is available online. Also played was a cover of the Nick Cave song &quot;Red Right Hand. &quot; During their last tour, the band had played new songs &quot;Put Me In A Terror Pocket&quot;, &quot;Sandtrap,&quot; and &quot;The Fire and The Thud&quot; live. Lead singer/songwriter Alex Turner started a two-man project with the singer from the Rascals, Miles Kane. The band is called &#x27;The Last Shadow Puppets&#x27; The band released their new album Humbug in August of 2009, preceded by the single &quot; Crying Lightning&quot; They released their fourth studio album, entitled Suck It And See on June 6th 2011 http://www. arcticmonkeys. com/", "Mumford   Sons": "Mumford &amp; Sons are an indie folk/bluegrass group formed in London in December2007. The band consists of Marcus Mumford (lead vocals, guitar, bass drum), Country Winston (banjo, slide guitar, vocals), Ted Dwane (double bass, drums, vocals), and Ben Lovett (keyboards, accordion, vocals). Having received critical acclaim from The Guardian on their \"Band of the Day\" online forum, and resounding praise from nearly everyone who has witnessed them supporting The Maccabees and Laura Marling, Mumford &amp; Sons continue to turn heads in London's growing folk scene. Their debut EP, Lend Me Your Eyes , features four tracks, including lead single &quot;Roll away Your Stone&quot;. Chess Club released their second EP, &quot;Love Your Ground&quot;, on the 3rd November 2009 on 10inch vinyl. The third EP, &quot;The Cave and the Open Sea&quot; (which was limited to 500 vinyls) is available as a download from their official rawrip page. Their debut album Sigh No More was released on Gentlemen of the Road/Island Records on the 5th October 2009, and the first single &quot;Little Lion Man&quot; came out a week earlier. Several months after the release of Little Lion Man, it was voted #1 by listeners in the Australian Youth Radio station Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 for 2009. They played live in the Triple J studio on the countdown day to celebrate the result. In the summer of 2010, &quot;Little Lion Man&quot; peaked at #1 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and #45 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. &quot;The Cave&quot; peaked at #3 on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart and #27 on the Billboard Hot 100. Both singles have gone Platinum in the United States. Mumford &amp; Sons was ranked as one of VH1&#x27;s &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; artists of 2010. For the 2011 Grammys, the group were nominated for Best New Artist and Best Rock Song (for &quot;Little Lion Man&quot;), losing both awards, although a performance of &quot;The Cave&quot; at the ceremony gave the group major publicity. For the 2012 Grammys, the group are nominated for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Performance for &quot;The Cave&quot;. In Sept 2012, the band released their second studio album &quot;Babel&quot; to critical acclaim. It debuted at number one in the US and UK, becoming the fastest selling album of 2012 in the UK and the second-biggest selling debut in 2012 in the US. The album won Album of the Year at the 2013 Grammys. After the huge success of &quot;Babel&quot; and the subsequent tour, Ben Lovett told Rolling Stone &quot;there won't be any Mumford &amp; Sons&#x27; activities for the foreseeable future&#8230;we're going to take a considerable amount of time off and just go back to hanging out and having no commitments or pressure or anything like that. &quot; In Oct 2014, rumors started to circulate that the band were in the studio with producer James Ford, though it remains unclear whether a new third album is in the works. http://www. myspace. com/mumfordandsons http://www. mumfordandsons. com/", "Lifehouse": "Lifehouse is a post-grunge band pioneered by lead singer and songwriter Jason Wade. In the last 14 years, Lifehouse has released six albums, debuting with the multi-platinum album No Name Face in the year 2000. The group includes Jason Wade (lead vocals, guitar), Rick Woolstenhulme Jr. (drums, percussion) and Bryce Soderberg (vocals, bass guitar). They have sold upwards of fifteen million singles and albums worldwide to date. The band holds its roots in California, where Lifehouse&#x27;s founding members first came together under the name Blyss in 1999. Blyss released a demo album entitled Diff&#x27;s Lucky Day . Shortly after in 2000, the boys were signed onto a record deal with DreamWorks Records. Five of the twelve tracks from Diff&#x27;s Lucky Day were re-recorded for No Name Face . This debut album went multi-platinum, standing behind the hit single Hanging by a Moment, which became the most played radio track of 2001. The song became the theme of the 2000 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT. In 2002, the members of Lifehouse consisted of foreman Jason Wade, bassist Sergio Andrade, drummer Rick Woolstenhulme and Woolstenhulme&#x27;s younger brother, Sean Woolstenhulme, on guitar. At this time, Lifehouse released their second album Stanley Climbfall . After a few years of touring, Sergio Andrade left the band on good terms in 2004. Sean Woolstenhulme soon followed, leaving the band to pursue personal projects. With only Wade and Woolstenhulme remaining, Lifehouse picked up a third member, ex-AM Radio bassist/vocalist Bryce Soderberg in late 2004. The band also signed off with Geffen Records, releasing their third self-titled album in 2005. With their style of melodic rock maturing over the years, the album&#x27;s feature single You and Me remained on the Billboard hot 100 chart for over 60 weeks. Further developing their image as a band that has overcome stereotypes and endured change, the Lifehouse trio came back quickly, releasing their latest album Who We Are in June 2007. The new single First Time has since been released on radio and television. It was announced on October 15, 2010 that the new album is called Smoke &amp; Mirrors and would be released on December 8, 2009. However, on November 13 the band stated on its web page that Smoke &amp; Mirrors would be released on February 2, 2010. The first single was &quot;Halfway Gone&quot;, which was released on October 27. The Halfway Gone music video premiered on the VH1 Top 20 on VH1. com at the end of November. On December 22, Tommy2. net reported that the album had been pushed back once again, this time to February 23, 2010. The album was then delayed again, but was released on March 2, 2010. The album came in a standard, deluxe, and two-disc deluxe edition. The album Smoke and Mirrors debuted at # 6 on the Billboard Top 200 chart with 54,203 sold. This marks the highest chart debut of their ten year career beating out first week chart position for their 2002 sophomore set \"Stanley Climbfall\" which debuted at # 7. On iTunes, Smoke and Mirrors was #1 on the Rock Album chart for one week. After Halfway gone, two more songs from this album were released: All In (June, 2010) and Falling In (January, 2011). In the spring of 2010 Lifehouse toured with Daughtry and Cavo. They also did a short European tour in September, 2010. After the European tour, the US the Smoke and Mirrors tour took place (October, 2010 and November, 2010). June 11, 2011 Lifehouse stated that they are working on a new album and that they will get back in the studio in the fall. June 12 and June 13, 2011 the band played two shows in the UK. During these shows, they played a new song called &#x27;Angeline. &#x27; Discography: No Name Face (2000) Stanley Climbfall (2002) Lifehouse (2005) Who We Are (2007) Smoke &amp; Mirrors (2010) Almeria (2012) Out of the Wasteland (2015)", "Marilyn Manson": "Marilyn Manson is an American rock band from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, United States formed in 1989 by frontman Marilyn Manson and Daisy Berkowitz. The group was originally named Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids, with their theatrical performances gathering a local cult following in the early 1990s, until the band shortened the name in 1992. The band&#x27;s lineup has changed between many of their album releases; the current members of Marilyn Manson are the eponymous lead singer (the only remaining original member), bassist Twiggy Ramirez, live guitarist Paul Wiley, drummer Gil Sharone, and live percussionist / keyboardist Daniel Fox. Until 1996, the name of each member was originally created by combining the first name of an iconic female sex symbol and the last name of an iconic serial killer (e. g. Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson). The members of the band dress in outlandish makeup and costumes, and have engaged in intentionally shocking behavior both onstage and off. In the past, their lyrics often received criticism for their anti-religious sentiment and references to sex, violence and drugs. Their performances have frequently been called offensive and obscene, and, on several occasions, protests and petitions have led to the group being banned from performing. As this controversy began to wane throughout the 2000s, so did the band&#x27;s mainstream popularity. Despite this, in June 2003, veteran rock journalist Jon Wiederhorn of MTV. com referred to Marilyn Manson as &quot;the only true artist today,&quot; and the frontman and band continues to have a strong cult following in 2015. Marilyn Manson has garnered much success: four of the band&#x27;s releases have achieved multi-platinum and three albums have gold, and the band has seen seven of its releases debut in the top ten, including two #1 albums. Marilyn Manson has sold over 50 million records. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ &mdash;HISTORY&mdash; The Spooky Kids: 1989-1993 In 1989, Brian Warner was a college student working toward a journalism degree, and gaining experience in the field by writing music articles for a South Florida lifestyle magazine, 25th Parallel. It was in this capacity that he was able to meet several of the musicians to whom his own band would later be compared, including My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. He met Scott Putesky shortly afterward and, after showing him some lyrics and poems he had written, proposed that they form a band together. Warner, guitarist Putesky, and bassist Brian Tutunick recorded their first demo tape as Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids in late 1989, taking on the stage names of Marilyn Manson, Daisy Berkowitz and Olivia Newton Bundy, respectively. They were soon joined by keyboardist Perry Pandrea, also known as Zsa Zsa Speck, who shortly left the band after the fourth show. Stephen Bier, who called himself Madonna Wayne Gacy, was his replacement; Bundy was replaced by Gidget Gein in 1990, born Brad Stewart. In 1991, drummer Fred Streithorst joined the band, with the stage name Sara Lee Lucas. The stage names used by each member were representative of a concept the band considered central: the dichotomy of good and evil, and the existence of both, together, in every whole. &quot;Marilyn Monroe had a dark side,&quot; explained Manson in his autobiography, &quot;just as Charles Manson has a good, intelligent side. &quot; Images of both Monroe and Manson, as well as of others equally famous and notorious, were common in the band&#x27;s early promotional materials. The Spooky Kids&#x27; popularity in the area grew quickly, largely because of radio DJ Scott David of WYNX-FM, an early fan who eagerly played songs from the band&#x27;s demo tapes on the air; and because of the band&#x27;s highly visual concerts, which drew from performance art and used many shock techniques. It was not uncommon to see onstage naked women nailed to a cross, a child in a cage, or bloody animal body parts; Manson, Berkowitz, and Gein variously performed in women&#x27;s clothing or bizarre costumes; and, for lack of a professional pyro-technician, they would occasionally set their own stage props on fire. The band would dramatically contrast these grotesque theatrics with elements drawn from the culture of the members&#x27; youth in the 1970s and 1980s: characters from that era&#x27;s children&#x27;s television made regular, often somewhat altered, appearances on Marilyn Manson flyers and newsletters, and were frequently sampled in the music. They continued to perform and release cassettes--shortening their name to Marilyn Manson in 1992--until the summer of 1993, when the band drew the attention of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, who at the time had just founded his own record label, Nothing Records. Portrait of an American Family: 1993-1995 Reznor offered Marilyn Manson a contract with his new label and the opportunity to support Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming headlining tour. The band accepted both offers, and recording sessions for its national debut, Portrait of an American Family, began in July 1993. Working with producer Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida, the band recorded a selection of new songs along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire and, by the end of Autumn 1993, had completed the first version of their debut, titled The Manson Family Album. However, it was not well received. The abrasive sonic &quot;rawness&quot; that Mosimann&#x27;s production had brought to such groups as Swans had failed to materialize on The Manson Family Album; Reznor and all the band&#x27;s members found it flat and lifeless, and poorly representative of Marilyn Manson&#x27;s dynamic performances. &quot;I thought, &#x27;This really sucks&#x27;, Manson explained, &quot;so I played it for Trent, and he thought it sucked. &quot; At the same time, the band was having difficulties with Gidget Gein, who had begun to lose control of his addiction to heroin. While reworking the album the band played two shows in South Florida under the name Mrs. Scabtree. Not much is known about the complete lineup, except that Manson performed on the drums, Gacy on keyboard, Berkowitz on guitar, and Jeordie White of Miami thrash metal band Amboog-a-Lard and Jessicka of Jack Off Jill sharing vocal duties. Four other local musicians, bassists Mark Dubin of Sister Venus and Patrick Joyce from The Itch, guitarist Miles Hie, and violinist Mary Karlzen, were also involved. In October 1993, Reznor agreed to rework the production on Marilyn Manson&#x27;s album, taking them and their tapes to The Record Plant in Los Angeles. Gein, who had been hospitalized after an overdose, was not invited. After seven weeks of mixing, remixing, and rerecording, the album -- now titled Portrait of an American Family -- was ready to be presented to Interscope Records. Even as the first single Get Your Gunn was beginning to receive radio airplay, Gein received a letter declaring his services &quot;no longer needed&quot; by the band after he overdosed on heroin for the fourth time; he was replaced by White, of Amboog-a-Lard, who undertook the alias Twiggy Ramirez. In December 1993, Ramirez first performed as the band&#x27;s new bass player on a week&#x27;s worth of headline dates through Florida with Jack Off Jill opening. While playing Club 5 in Jacksonville, Manson was accused by the town&#x27;s Christian Coalition of violating the town&#x27;s adult entertainment codes. Jack Off Jill singer Jessicka was accused of solicitation and offering to engage in lewdness. Both singers were arrested and charged with misdemeanors. Portrait of an American Family was released on July 19, 1994 in the US through Nothing/Interscope. On the first date of a fourteen-week national tour opening for Nine Inch Nails, Ramirez made his national touring debut. It was during this tour that Manson had the occasion to meet with Church of Satan founder Dr. Anton LaVey. After a cordial meeting, LaVey honored Manson with the title of &quot;Reverend&quot; -- meaning, in the Church of Satan, a person who is revered by the church, and not necessarily one who dedicates his life to preaching the religion to others, as with a priest or minister. Manson would use this title in album liner notes, citing himself as &quot;Reverend Marilyn Manson. &quot; On February 6, 1995, the band released the Lunchbox single, which featured a cover of Gary Numan&#x27;s Down In the Park. In March 1995, the band began its first national headlining tour, a two-month outing with Monster Voodoo Machine as support; this would be drummer Sara Lee Lucas&#x27; last tour with the band. Tension between Lucas and Manson had apparently grown as the tour wore on and, on the next-to-last night of the tour, Manson secretly decided to end the show with a flourish: during a performance of Lunchbox, he doused Lucas&#x27; drum kit in lighter fluid and set it ablaze - with Lucas still attempting to play on behind it. (Manson apparently forgot that the band had one more date to play. ) Lucas quit the band after the final gig the next night. Less than two weeks later his replacement, Kenneth Wilson, better known by his stage name Ginger Fish, joined the group. Marilyn Manson was touring again, this time on a bill with Danzig and Korn. That tour ended in summer 1995, after which the band relocated to the new home of Nothing Studios in New Orleans, Louisiana to begin work on the third single from Portrait of an American Family, Dope Hat. Accompanied by a music video which featured Manson in the role of Willy Wonka in a shock-horror version of Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory, the proposed single for Dope Hat eventually developed into an hour-long EP called Smells Like Children. The album&#x27;s fifteen tracks of covers, remixes, and bizarre sonic experiments also included the band&#x27;s version of the Eurythmics&#x27; Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This), which would prove to be Marilyn Manson&#x27;s first legitimate hit: the video was placed in heavy rotation on MTV (in stark contrast with the &quot;Dope Hat&quot; video, which MTV had banished to late-night airplay only a few months before) and the mainstream music press was suddenly clamoring to cover the group. It was also around this time that the group began to experiment with goth makeup, and more bizarre outfits. A seven-month headlining tour followed, from June through February, during which the band began to debut new material including Irresponsible Hate Anthem, Minute of Decay, Tourniquet, and Smells Like Children (an early incarnation of Kinderfeld). Rumors of a new album circulated widely during this time, and were confirmed when the band returned to Nothing&#x27;s New Orleans studio in early 1996 to perform what Manson termed &quot;a musical ritual designed to bring about the Apocalypse. &quot; Antichrist Superstar: 1996-1997 Marilyn Manson&#x27;s second full-length studio album, Antichrist Superstar, was released on October 8, 1996. The rock opera concept album was recorded at Nothing Studios with Trent Reznor himself acting as executive producer; the process of making the album was reportedly a long and difficult one, highlighted by experiments allegedly involving sleep deprivation and near-constant drug use in an effort to create an environment suited to the album&#x27;s moody and occasionally violent content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, which caused the departure of guitarist and Spooky Kids founding member Daisy Berkowitz. With Berkowitz out of the band, Twiggy Ramirez performed lead guitar for much of the recording of Antichrist Superstar, and the group placed an ad seeking a new guitarist for its upcoming tour; Timothy Linton, auditioned for and was given the position. Breaking with the six-year tradition of icon / killer naming structures, the newest member was dubbed Zim Zum - a name derived from Kabbalah, one of the major sources of inspiration for the album. The album&#x27;s first single, The Beautiful People, made a fairly major impact on the alternative rock charts, and created enough anticipation for Antichrist Superstar that the album debuted at #3 on the album charts. The band&#x27;s frontman was featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine who also awarded the band their Best New Artist accolade for 1996. &quot;I&#x27;ve always felt in my heart that we were going to get there,&quot; remarked Manson. &quot;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason why someone with as much to say as me should be limited to saying it to a few people. I should be on the same scale as the Spice Girls or Michael Jackson. &quot; The year-and-a-half long &quot;Dead to the World Tour&quot; in support of the album followed; it was the band&#x27;s longest and widest-ranging tour yet, and included Marilyn Manson&#x27;s live debut in Alaska, Hawaii, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, South America, Asia and Australia as their fame spread to all corners of the world. In the United States, however, the band was receiving more attention than ever before, and not all of it was positive. As the tour was getting underway, the band found itself the target of congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. Lieberman would later go on to refer to Marilyn Manson as &quot;perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company&quot;. In addition, nearly every performance on the tour was picketed by religious organizations, pleading with fans to not see the musician who once said &quot;I think every time people listen to this new album maybe God will be destroyed in their brainwashed minds. &quot; On November 10, 1997, the band released a remix/live EP called Remix &amp; Repent, featuring new versions of Antichrist Superstar&#x27;s four singles, The Beautiful People, Tourniquet, Antichrist Superstar, and Man that You Fear, alongside songs recorded live on the U. S. leg of the Dead to the World Tour. Two unreleased songs from the Antichrist Superstar recording sessions were contributed to film soundtracks: Apple of Sodom to David Lynch&#x27;s Lost Highway, and The Suck for Your Solution to the Howard Stern&#x27;s Private Parts: The Album. As the year ended, Manson made the announcement of the upcoming publication of his first book, the autobiographical The Long Hard Road Out of Hell ; the book was released in February 1998, along with another live document of the world tour, a home video entitled Dead to the World. It also came to light around this time that Antichrist Superstar would be the first installment in a concept album trilogy and that the release of the follow-up was, according to the band, also imminent, accompanied by early rumors of the involvement of Billy Corgan and The Dust Brothers with the as-yet-untitled album. Mechanical Animals: 1998-1999 On September 15, 1998, Marilyn Manson released the second part of his triptych, Mechanical Animals, an album strongly influenced by David Bowie and his 1974 album Diamond Dogs. Interscope&#x27;s promotion of the album was massive, including an enormous billboard of singer Manson as an androgynous extraterrestrial over Times Square, and repeated appearances on MTV and other networks to promote the album and the single The Dope Show; propelled by the success of Antichrist Superstar and by this press push, the album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 chart. The band had recast itself in a new image for this album; Marilyn Manson were now a glam rock outfit, setting aside the bleak darkness of the previous record for a more concealed morbidity and borrowing its visual presentation largely from Bowie, and from Roxy Music and its contemporaries. By this time, the band had permanently relocated to Los Angeles, and Zim Zum had been replaced by glam-influenced guitarist John Lowery, who joined the band as John 5. After a brief promotional tour, the band set out on the &quot;Beautiful Monsters Tour&quot; with Hole and Monster Magnet as support. The tour, however, would be a problematic one: on March 1, 1999, the three bands played the first show in Spokane, Washington; by March 14, Hole had left the tour and Manson had broken his ankle, forcing postponements of some shows. The tour was then renamed the &quot;Rock is Dead Tour&quot; and both Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy were asked to take select remaining opening slots on tour. Less than three weeks after the tour resumed, two students (Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold) at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado killed thirteen people, and then took their own lives; early media reports declared them fans of &quot;violent&quot; music and video games. Substantial attention was directed at the frontman. On April 28, out of respect for the victims, the band canceled the remaining dates of the tour, and would not reappear in Denver until the 2001 Ozzfest. Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death): 2000-2001 The latter half of 1999 and much of 2000 was a period of relative silence for Marilyn Manson. The band spent over a year quietly writing and recording in a studio in Death Valley, with only the single Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes -- an outtake from Antichrist Superstar -- appearing during that time. On November 14, 2000, Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) was released. Returning to the darker, more abrasive sound of Antichrist Superstar, much of the album&#x27;s content was written in response to the Columbine massacre. The album&#x27;s third single, The Nobodies, was directly inspired by the shootings. Described by the band as the third part of the trilogy begun with Antichrist Superstar and continued in Mechanical Animals, its overarching theme is an exploration of the relationship between death and fame in American culture, and its lyrics and artwork contain many references to John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald, John Lennon and Mark David Chapman, and even Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth. The international &quot;Guns, God and Government Tour&quot; expanded upon the exploration of America&#x27;s fascination with violence, and with the tour&#x27;s logo - a rifle and handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross -- Manson made no attempt to conceal what he saw as the source of that fascination. The band also revealed that within Marilyn Manson&#x27;s massive concept album trilogy, Holy Wood serves as a prequel to Mechanical Animals and Antichrist Superstar despite the latter two preceding Holy Wood in release date. Each of the three albums contain its own storyline distinct from one other but also linked together abstractly in a fourth larger overarching storyline encompassing all three. Manson has offered this much in the way of an interpretation: &quot;Holy Wood is about wanting to fit into a world that didn&#x27;t want me, and fighting really hard to get there. The album&#x27;s deepest elements are idealism and the desire to start a revolution. If you begin with Holy Wood, then Mechanical Animals really talks about how that revolution gets taken away from you and turned into a product, and then Antichrist Superstar is where you&#x27;re given a choice to decide if you&#x27;re going to be controlled by the power that you created or if you want to destroy yourself and then start over. It just becomes a cycle. &quot; On May 16, 2001, Manson announced on the band website that he planned to quote the Bible at his next concert, to &quot;balance out&quot; his violent lyrics, &quot;so we can examine the virtues of wonderful Christian stories of disease, murder, adultery, suicide and child sacrifice. Now that seems like entertainment to me. &quot; On June 21, 2001, Manson did indeed read from the Bible onstage in Denver, Colorado, presenting such passages as Leviticus 20:9 (&quot;For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall surely be put to death&quot;) and Psalm 137:9 (&quot;Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones. &quot;) This tour was documented in a DVD release of the same name, released October 29, 2002 and described by Manson as &quot;This will help you see what it&#x27;s like to be nailed to this wrecking ball&quot; on the DVD packaging. In addition to a compilation style concert from the tour (songs from multiple individual shows edited to appear as single performance), the DVD includes a short thirty minute film titled &quot;Death Parade&quot; in the style of an All Access Pass for the tour. Seven years later it was followed by Guns, God and Government - Live in L. A. Released in Blu-ray on November 17, 2009, it depicts the sixteen song set of the Los Angeles performance in its entirety. The Golden Age of Grotesque: 2002-2003 With the &quot;triptych&quot; of the previous three albums now complete, Marilyn Manson was free to begin a fresh project. In 2002, Jonathan Davis of Korn invited Marilyn Manson into a studio to record vocals on a track he wrote titled Redeemer. The song, produced by both Jon and Richard Gibbs, was then released on the Queen of the Damned soundtrack. Marilyn Manson also released a music video for their cover of Soft Cell's Tainted Love for the Not Another Teen Movie soundtrack. After finding inspiration in the decadent Swing era of the 1920s, the band recorded The Golden Age of Grotesque that year and the album was released on May 13, 2003. Eschewing the lyrical depth and volume of symbolism and hidden meaning of Holy Wood, the new album was relatively straightforward; in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized music to the entartete Kunst banned by the Nazi regime. New member Tim Skold, replacing Twiggy Ramirez, added a new dimension to the band&#x27;s sound; he brought with him from KMFDM the band&#x27;s use of heavy industrial beats, influenced by the popular nu-metal sound at the time. The album debuted at No. 1 on the album charts, selling over 118,000 copies in the US its first week of release. It won a 2003 Metal Edge Readers&#x27; Choice Award for &quot;Album of the Year. &quot; Another world tour, the &quot;Grotesk Burlesk Tour&quot;, followed, which furthered the album&#x27;s Weimar Republic-inspired theme by adding elements of German Kabarett to the group&#x27;s performances. Elaborate artwork by Gottfried Helnwein appeared in the band&#x27;s stage dressing, and the members began appearing both on-stage and off- in designer suits and with fashion superstars. Lest We Forget and Hiatus: 2004-2005 Lest We Forget: The Best Of was released on September 28, 2004. It was referred to by Manson as his &quot;farewell&quot; album when earlier that month, coinciding with Trent Reznor leaving New Orleans for the west coast, the Nine Inch Nails website officially announced &quot;nothing studios: 1994-2004&quot;, suggesting that Nothing Studios was closed. This later proved to be the end of the associated vanity record label, as well as Manson&#x27;s business association (effectively then shifting the band to a full Interscope contract) when Reznor successfully sued co-founder John Malm for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty (amongst others). Lest We Forget was supported by a series of &quot;greatest hits&quot; performances on the &quot;Against All Gods Tour. &quot; After the release of the single Personal Jesus, the band made a number of promotional appearances including a performance on MADtv; at one of these, the Comet awards show in Germany, drummer Ginger Fish fell from his drum riser, fracturing his skull and wrist. Former Nine Inch Nails drummer Chris Vrenna replaced him; after recovering from the accident Fish had been recording and performing with a new band, Martyr Plot, before rejoining Marilyn Manson. John 5 had also been replaced; Mark Chaussee of Fight took over lead guitar on the &quot;Against All Gods Tour,&quot; and was subsequently replaced in the studio by Tim Skold. Though John 5 denied any hostility towards Marilyn Manson following the announcement of his departure, at the band&#x27;s appearance on the Rock am Ring music festival in 2003 an incident took place between John 5 and Marilyn Manson where Manson kicked and then shoved the guitarist. John 5 responded with anger, throwing off his guitar mid-song and raising his fists to Manson, before resuming the song. Lest We Forget was certified Gold in 2005. Celebritarian Corporation: 2006 Beginning in January 2006, and continuing for some months, Marilyn Manson&#x27;s official website was updated several times, adding new artwork and music, and making obtuse references to The Celebritarian Corporation, an art movement led by the frontman. Merchandise has since become available featuring logos such as the &quot;double cross&quot; (a variation on the Cross of Lorraine), as well as the slogans &quot;we will sell our shadow to those who stand within it&quot; and &quot;do not seek death; seek destruction. &quot; There were rumors about a new album all year long, but the frontman was focused on showcasing his watercolor artwork and sharing his ideas about his film Phantasmagoria . Marilyn Manson finally came back into the music world with their performance of This is Halloween - a cover for Tim Burton&#x27;s The Nightmare Before Christmas at The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on October 31, 2006. This was the first performance since the Against All Gods tour ended in 2005, and the last performance with Madonna Wayne Gacy in the band. It was then that Manson started talking about his next album co-written with Tim Skold. Eat Me, Drink Me: 2007-2008 Marilyn Manson&#x27;s sixth studio album, Eat Me, Drink Me, was released on June 5, 2007, debuting at number 8 in the United States with more than 88,000 copies sold. Released more than four years after The Golden Age of Grotesque, Eat Me, Drink Me marked another drastic change in musical styles that the band has become famous for - opting for a more introspective direction. One remarkable note of the album is that it was written entirely by Manson and Skold in a rented home studio. The album is also the first major label Manson album without Madonna Wayne Gacy (Pogo) as a listed member, making lead singer Marilyn Manson the only original member since Portrait of an American Family. Chris Vrenna, who temporarily replaced Ginger Fish on drums during the Against All Gods Tour, replaced Pogo to become the band&#x27;s full-time keyboardist. Marilyn Manson co-headlined a tour with Slayer in order to promote the album with Bleeding Through as the opening act and Deadly Apples on select dates. Rumors also circulated for some time that Marilyn Manson wrote the song Mutilation Is the Most Sincere Form of Flattery as an attack on the band My Chemical Romance. He later denied this, stating that it was aimed at people in general who sought to imitate him. In another interview Manson stated that &quot;I&#x27;m embarrassed to be me because these people are doing a really sad, pitiful, shallow version of what I&#x27;ve done. &quot; In response to this, Gerard Way, the lead singer of My Chemical Romance claimed nothing Manson could say would bring the band down. On January 9, 2008, Marilyn Manson posted a bulletin on MySpace confirming that former bassist Twiggy Ramirez had rejoined the band, resulting in the exit of Tim Skold. Skold and Manson had apparently began writing new material before the personnel change. Future collaborations with Skold were not ruled out. The High End of Low: 2008-2009 The band&#x27;s seventh full-length studio album began recording sessions following the conclusion of their &quot;Rape of the World Tour&quot; on March 2, 2008. On November 29, 2007, Marilyn Manson fansite &quot;The Heirophant&quot; reported that the frontman planned to start writing songs for the new record on January or February (2008). The actual recording took place at Manson&#x27;s Hollywood Hills home between November 2008 and January 5, 2009. The last song, called 15, was completed on the evening of Manson&#x27;s Jan 5 birthday--hence the name. Manson said, &quot;after my greatest hits album Lest We Forget: The Best Of came out, I took a long break from music because it was a period where I was not sure who I wanted to be. I left music for a while but that&#x27;s not an error I want to repeat in the future. &quot; He mentioned Kerry King, James Iha, and Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs as likely contributors. During an exclusive interview titled Everyone Will Suffer Now at the now-defunct fansite MansonUSA (The Heirophant) on January 11, 2008, Manson shared, &quot;I just feel like there is a big change happening now. It&#x27;s going to be the one. Eat Me, Drink Me is opening the window and this is going to be the Hurricane Katrina. &quot; Since parting company with Skold and reuniting with Ramirez, the band had occupied themselves with work on the album to achieve their target of a February 2009 release. It was soon followed by the announcement of new tour dates. In an interview with Steppin&#x27; Out, Manson described the then-nascent record as, &quot;very ruthless, very heavy, and very violent. &quot; On August 14, 2008, Manson announced at a public interview in Seoul, Korea that former Limp Bizkit guitarist and current Black Light Burns frontman Wes Borland had joined the lineup, replacing Rob Holliday on guitars. The band attended the ETP Festival and were wrapping up production on the new album. However, Borland left a few months later to reunite with Limp Bizkit for the third time. Borland told UK&#x27;s Kerrang Magazine that he quit after seeing none of the nine songs he wrote for the record make the final cut, and was extremely dissatisfied at the thought of being just a hired gun. On October 5, the band played a special show at the annual Hot Topic managers meeting. The show took place at the Los Angeles International Airport&#x27;s Marriott Hotel. During an after party for the 2008 Scream Awards, Manson was overheard comparing the new album to Antichrist Superstar and stating the album was &quot;pretty much finished. &quot; He expected a new song to be released before the end of the year and expressed desire to release the record by Valentine&#x27;s Day. In an interview on the February 2009 issue of Revolver Magazine, he revealed the title of two songs, namely, I Wanna Kill You Like They Do in the Movies and Armagoddamnmotherfuckinggeddon. The album&#x27;s producer Sean Beavan, later posted a Myspace blog revealing two more song titles: 15 and Four Rusted Horses. Manson told Revolver &quot;I&#x27;ve got my fire back,&quot; and the record &quot;really wipes the floor with everything we&#x27;ve done before. &quot; A statement was released by Manson on Christmas Eve in order to dispel rumors that had been circulating regarding his relationship with Evan Rachel Wood and a speculated collaboration with rapper Ne-Yo. On January 12, a new song title was divulged by Rudy Coby, a collaborator and friend of the frontman. The song is called Devour and was said to be the album&#x27;s first track. It was announced that Marilyn Manson would perform with Slayer again as headliners for the Rockstar Energy Mayhem Festival tour in 2009. The press release for the tour stated that &quot;Manson is currently in the studio working on his seventh studio album scheduled for release May 18th on Interscope Records. &quot; On February 2, Rolling Stone confirmed the album had been officially titled The High End of Low. On March 18, 2009, Kerrang! reported that the album contained a total of 15 tracks and revealed another new song entitled We&#x27;re from America. Manson said on the latter song, &quot;I think a lot of people will hear the track and initially think it&#x27;s just political, but it&#x27;s not just that, it&#x27;s also me describing a lot of fucked-up scenarios that I&#x27;m going through in my personal life. Someone asked me, &#x27;Why are you so fucked up?&#x27;, &#x27;Well, I am from America. &#x27; I hate the fact that so many people have fucked the country up, and so many people fucked up my personal life and I allowed it to happen. So in a way, I feel like America as a whole feels, but in no way does that make me a tree-hugging patriotic freedom rocker. &quot; The track was released exclusively on the band&#x27;s official website as a free download on March 27, 2009. On April 7, it became available for purchase as a digital single. The album&#x27;s official first single, Arma-Goddamn-Motherfuckin-Geddon, arrived in radio stations on April 21. It peaked at number 37 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. On April 16, 2009, marilynmanson. com was updated with a new splash page featuring the projected album artwork as well as the track listing for The High End of Low. The record was released on May 26, 2009. It debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200 with 49,000 copies sold. Despite reaching a higher charting position than Manson&#x27;s prior studio effort Eat Me, Drink Me, which debuted at #8, it arrived with the lowest opening week sum of any of Manson&#x27;s albums since The Last Tour on Earth opened with sales of 26,000 units in 1999. After much fan speculation and no official announcement, Andy Gerold joined Marilyn Manson in the capacity of live bassist for &quot;The High End of Low Tour&quot; after former bassist Twiggy Ramirez switched to lead guitar duties. Gerold played his first show with the band on June 3, 2009, in Brno, Czech Republic. As of 2011, Gerold is still the youngest musician to play in the band, preceding former drummer Sara Lee Lucas by nearly seven years. During the summer of 2009, the band co-headlined the 2009 Mayhem Festival with Slayer. Later in October 2009, the band headlined the internationally advertised visual kei event, V-Rock Music festival. Born Villain: 2010-2013 The eighth studio album by Marilyn Manson entered the writing phase during &quot;The High End of Low Tour&quot; in 2009. Bassist Twiggy projected a release date of 2011 through Cooking Vinyl Records and Marilyn Manson&#x27;s own label Hell, etc. It is the band&#x27;s first album since allowing their contract with Interscope Records to expire back in late 2009. Marilyn Manson attested that the lyrical content of the album would be &quot;more romantic&quot; yet &quot;self-abusive,&quot; and described the sonic elements of the record as &quot;suicide death metal. &quot; The prospect of an eighth studio album by the band was first confirmed by the frontman himself during an interview with Metal Hammer on December 3, 2009. He elaborated, &quot;We&#x27;ve just been released from our record contract with Interscope so I think a lot of the creative control on which my hands were tied on a lot of choices--the music videos--things like that. And the first example is the newest video, they clearly wouldn&#x27;t have allowed me to make that video. So we started writing new songs on the road--a bit like David Bowie&#x27;s album Aladdin Sane--I think people can expect a new record a lot sooner than we expected. &quot; According to Chris Vrenna, by January 2010, the band was already &quot;talking and coming up with concepts&quot; for the album. On January 24, 2010, Manson confirmed on the band&#x27;s official MySpace profile that &quot;the new album is officially in motion. &quot; In April 2010, during his appearance at the Revolver Golden Gods Awards, Manson divulged that the band had recorded 13 songs, one of which failed to appear in a television series about vampires. He referred to the album as &quot;very death metal&quot; and voiced interest in releasing the album differently from previous Marilyn Manson records. He also indicated his friendship with Slayer as a vague influence on the record. During an interview with Full Metal Jackie, he stated that the album was halfway finished. On May 7, 2010, both entertainer Rudy Coby and The Nachtkabarett&#x27;s Nick Kushner were previewed material from the album, the latter described it on Facebook as &quot;fuckin&#x27; hardcore. &quot; Elaborating on the band&#x27;s musical direction, Manson commented on Twiggy being influenced by his touring experiences in 2009, particularly during the Rockstar Mayhem Festival. Manson&#x27;s father, Hugh Warner, described the album: &quot;It will make a vagina wet. What can you say after that? If the vagina&#x27;s wet, all things are good. That&#x27;s what he told me when I was listening to it. It&#x27;s very hard, very heavy, very good. Everyone should be extremely excited and happy. &quot; During an interview with Eric Blair on November 3, 2010, bassist Twiggy Ramirez indicated that the new album was &quot;almost done. It&#x27;ll probably be out next year. It&#x27;s our best record yet, I think. I mean, everyone always says that, but I think this is our best work so far&#8230; It&#x27;s kind of like a little more of a punk rock Mechanical Animals without sounding too pretentious. &quot; For much of the early half of 2011, Marilyn Manson removed himself from the public spotlight and ceased almost all communication with his fans or the outside world. On February 24, 2011, the band&#x27;s longtime drummer Ginger Fish announced his resignation from the group, prompting a search for a replacement. Meanwhile, on March 18, 2011, Marilyn Manson took a short break from his self-imposed sequestration by appearing in the music video for the song Tempat Ku by Brunei pop outfit D&#x27;Hask. On March 23, 2011, he uploaded new pictures onto the band&#x27;s Facebook page, in a different style of previous photos. The new style suggested the &#x27;new era&#x27; of Marilyn Manson had begun, further generating anticipation for the upcoming release. On May 22, 2011, the band&#x27;s website underwent a complete overhaul. A short 26 second snippet of a new song, tentatively titled, &quot;I am among no one (excerpt from an undisclosed song with an unreleased title)&quot; was uploaded to the redesigned main page along with a new logo to signify their eight studio album and the new era. The logo consisted of the letter M repeated four times in a spiral pattern, each with one long tail. At the end of the long tail is the Chinese trigram  (Li  li) of the I Ching. Read lengthwise or up-and-down, it formed Hexagram 30, &quot;Radiance,&quot; also called &quot;the clinging&quot; and &quot;the net. &quot; The origin of the character is rooted in symbols of long-tailed birds such as the peacock or the legendary phoenix. The CMYK coloring was also notable with regard to an acrostic formed by Manson, in a journal entry that accompanied the site changes, which spelled out the words &quot;Christianity Manufactures Yesterdays Killers. &quot; On June 3, 2011 the Brazilian edition of the Portuguese broadsheet newspaper Destak confirmed that agents for the band had finalized negotiations for the group to tour in Brazil and other South American countries as part of the SWU Music &amp; Arts Festival beginning on the second week of November 2011. The Brazilian music festival also saw a change in venue for 2011. While organizers have yet to finalize details, it was speculated that the event may be held at the Sao Paulo municipality of Paulinia. Manson appeared live via the Ustream broadcast of Fleischer&#x27;s Universe on June 21, 2011, where he announced that the new album title will be revealed within a week. He also divulged the following lyrics, &quot;The center of the universe cannot exist if there are no edges&quot;, of a yet to be released song. The album title was not, in fact, revealed within a week, but was announced on September 1 as Born Villain via Twitter. After being impressed by his directorial work on one of Kid Cudi&#x27;s music videos, Marilyn Manson employed the actor Shia LaBeouf to work on the album artwork as well as create a &quot;making-of&quot; video documenting the album&#x27;s recording and production. On November 22, 2011, it was announced that Chris Vrenna had officially left the band after contributing to the writing and production of Born Villain. Two months prior to release, the band begun to support the album with the Hey Cruel World&#8230; Tour. On May 1, 2012, Born Villain was released worldwide. It debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard 200, No. 3 on Top 100 Rock albums, and No. 1 on both Top Independent Albums and Hard Rock Albums. Marilyn Manson continued touring for the album by performing joint concerts with Rob Zombie and Alice Cooper on the Twins of Evil Tour and Masters of Madness Tour. The Pale Emperor: 2013-2015 Marilyn Manson started production for his ninth studio album in 2013. In early 2014, drummer Gil Sharone of Stolen Babies revealed he had been working on the new album since November. Manson premiered Cupid Carries a Gun on April 27 when it was used as the opening theme to the television series Salem. The song was composed and produced alongside Tyler Bates, who was also confirmed to act as co-producer for the upcoming album. The song was described by Manson as &quot;the last track we finished for my new album,&quot; indicating that he had completed production for his next studio album. On June 25, bassist Fred Sablan confirmed he had left the band, on good terms, and was replaced by Twiggy for their summer tour, with Tyler Bates to take over as lead guitarist and Paul Wiley as a live rhythm guitarist. The band completed a Summer tour in Europe, and a second new song entitled Killing Strangers premiered in the film John Wick on October 24. It was announced that another track would be released soon. Momentarily after it premiered on BBC Radio 1, the third new song (and first digital single) entitled Third Day of a Seven Day Binge was released as a free download at Marilyn Manson&#x27;s official website on October 26. It was accompanied with a new video and MM logo. The band performed several new songs live for the first time in October and early November, when they played a handful of concerts around southern California. An early 2015 North American tour called The Hell Not Hallelujah tour was announced shortly afterwards. The band also announced multiple festival dates in Australia, United States, and Europe. On December 5, Manson settled a fifteen year rift with The Smashing Pumpkins frontman Billy Corgan, by performing Third Day of a Seven Day Binge and Ava Adore with the band at the Camden Palace Theatre in London. This is the second time Manson has done guest vocals at a Smashing Pumpkins show. The first time, Manson and Twiggy performed Eye and The Beautiful People with the original Smashing Pumpkins in October 1997 at the Bridge School Benefit in Los Angeles, CA. A fourth new track called Deep Six was released on YouTube through Marilyn Manson&#x27;s official website on December 14. The track was released as a single on December 16, while a double A-sided CD single of Third Day of a Seven Day Binge with Deep Six was released exclusively at Best Buy on December 23. Cupid Carries a Gun was released as the third digital single from The Pale Emperor on January 7, 2015. The ninth album entitled The Pale Emperor was released on January 19 (UK) - January 20 (US), 2015. Marilyn Manson went on their seventeenth world tour in January to support the new album. Guitarist Tyler Bates departed from the Hell Not Hallelujah tour in April to focus on film and television projects. Live guitarist Paul Wiley assumed his role as lead guitarist. In the summer of 2015, the band is currently with The Smashing Pumpkins on the End Times tour in North America. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ &mdash;THE BAND MEMBERS&mdash;

The cast is second behind The Beatles for most chart appearances by a group act in the Billboard Hot 100&#x27;s history, and holds the record of sixth overall among all artists, with sixty-nine appearances. The cast has sold over thirty six million and over eleven million albums worldwide. The series&#x27; cover versions have also had a positive effect on the original recording artists, with sales of Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Take a Bow&quot; increasing by 189 percent after the song was covered in the Glee episode &quot;Showmance&quot;. The series features covers of numerous songs sung on-screen by the characters. Musical segments typically take the form of performances, as opposed to the characters singing spontaneously, as the intention is for the series to remain reality-based. Murphy is responsible for selecting all of the songs used, and strives to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits, as: &quot;I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That&#x27;s a tricky mix, but that&#x27;s very important -- the balancing of that. &quot; Song choices are integral to script development, with Murphy explaining: &quot;Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along. &quot; Glee is choreographed by Zach Woodlee, and features five to eight production numbers per episode. Once music rights are cleared, songs are arranged and pre-recorded by the cast. Woodlee constructs the accompanying dance moves, which are then taught to the cast and filmed. Numbers can take several weeks to prepare, depending on complexity. Each episode costs at least $3 million to produce, and can take up to 10 days to film as a result of the elaborate choreography. ", "Nightwish": "Nightwish is a symphonic metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vanska after the release of its debut album, Angels Fall First . In 2002, Vanska was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. Although Nightwish have been prominent in their home country since Angels Fall First , they did not achieve worldwide fame until the release of the albums Oceanborn , Wishmaster and Century Child . Their 2004 album, Once , has sold more than one million copies and was the band's breakthrough in the United States. Their biggest US hit single, Wish I Had an Angel , received MTV airplay and was included on three US film soundtracks to promote their North American tour. The band produced three more singles and two music videos for Once , as well as a re-recording of Sleeping Sun for the \"best of\" compilation album, Highest Hopes , before Turunen's dismissal in October 2005. Her last performance with Nightwish was recorded on the live album End of an Era ; after the show, the other members announced to Turunen that she was no longer a member of Nightwish. In May 2007, Nightwish announced Anette Olzon as Turunen's replacement. That September, the band released their sixth album, Dark Passion Play , which has sold almost 2 million copies. The album's lead single, Amaranth , became one of Nightwish's most successful in Europe. The supporting tour, one of the band's largest, started on October 6, 2007 and ended on September 19, 2009. The band released an EP/live album, Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places) , in March 2009 as a CD/DVD, and their seventh studio album, Imaginaerum , was released globally on various days in late 2011/early 2012. On October 1, 2012, Nightwish announced that they had parted ways with Olzon and would be finishing the current tour with ReVamp and former After Forever vocalist Floor Jansen. In October 2013, Nightwish made Jansen and longtime session uillean piper Troy Donockley permanent members of the band, and they are featured in the new album Endless Forms Most Beautiful , released March, 2015. The band also announced that drummer Jukka Nevalainen would be taking a temporary leave from the band due to insomnia, being replaced by drum technician Kai Hahto for the upcoming album and tour. 1 BIOGRAPHY 1. 1 Formation (1996) After playing keyboards in several heavy metal bands in the 1990s, including Nattvindens Grat, Perkele Bork and Darkwoods My Betrothed, Tuomas Holopainen decided to create his own project while sitting around a campfire with friends in 1996. He immediately had a clear idea of the music: experimental acoustic music he wrote himself, similar to the music usually played around campfires, but with a distinct sound and atmosphere, played on his keyboards. He soon invited friend and schoolmate Emppu Vuorinen to play acoustic guitars, and the classical vocalist Tarja Turunen, who shared the same music teacher, Plamen Dimov. The three musicians recorded their acoustic demo Nightwish in winter 1996. The name Nightwish was derived from their first song together - the demo also included the song The Forever Moments , and an early version of Etiainen . 1. 2 Debut album and first tour (1997-1998) In early 1997, following the release of the Nightwish demo, Jukka Nevalainen joined the band, and acoustic guitar was replaced with electric guitar. The addition of heavy metal elements to the band's existing experimental style gave the band a different sound, forming the core of the Nightwish sound. The band entered the studio in April 1997 to record seven songs for their second demo, Angels Fall First . In May 1997, the demo made its way to the Finnish record label Spinefarm Records, who wanted to release it as the band's debut album of the same name. The label signed Nightwish to a two album deal, and the band returned to the studio to record four songs more to accompany the tracks of the demo. The full-length album Angels Fall First was released in November 1997 and reached number 31 on the Finnish album charts, with the single The Carpenter reaching number 3 on the Finnish singles chart. The The Carpenter single was released as a split with label mates Children of Bodom and Thy Serpent; the album is also one of the two releases which features Holopainen's vocals, appearing on four of the album's eleven tracks alongside Turunen's. After encountering a mixed critical reception in their first year of existence, the band made their live debut in their hometown Kitee in December 1997. Since they were missing a bass player, Samppa Hirvonen joined them as a sessional live member. Marianna Pellinen was also a sessional live member as an additional keyboard player and a backing vocalist for Turunen. There were plans to make Hirvonen a permanent member, but he joined the army as part of Finnish army conscription just as they began recording Oceanborn, so they asked Sami Vanska to join instead, since Tuomas knew him from the band Nattvindens Grat. During the winter of 1997 and 1998, the band performed only seven times, because Turunen was finishing her schooling, and Nevalainen and Holopainen were serving their obligatory Finnish military service. Nightwish returned to the studio in August 1998 as a five-piece to record their follow-up album for Spinefarm Records. 1. 3 International success (1998-2000) In October 7, 1998, Nightwish released their second full-length album, Oceanborn , in Finland only. Adopting a more technical and progressive sound than Angels Fall First , Oceanborn saw the band abandon much of the ambient and folk elements present on their debut release, with the exception of the song Moondance . In contrast to the female vocals of Turunen, the album also featured guest growling vocals by Tapio Wilska (ex-Finntroll), since Tuomas did not want to sing again. Wilska is also a former member of Nattvindens Grat. Oceanborn was better received than the previous album, with AllMusic writing that the album >>as a whole works great<<, with songs that are >>very strong<<. Oceanborn was an instant success in Finland, reaching number 5 on the Finnish album charts. The album's first single, Sacrament of Wilderness , hit number 1 on the Finnish singles charts, where it stayed for several weeks. The album's release was initially limited to Finland, but because of the success of Sacrament of Wilderness , Spinefarm released Oceanborn internationally in the spring of 1999. In May 1999, Nightwish recorded the single Sleeping Sun (Four Ballads of the Eclipse) , and in one month the single sold 15 000 copies in Germany alone. Following the band's first international success, Nightwish was added as the opening band for Rage's 1999 European tour. Both the album Oceanborn and the singles Sacrament of Wilderness and Walking in the Air were certified gold in Finland in August 1999. While in the studio in early 2000 working on their third album, Nightwish was accepted in the Finnish Eurovision Song Contest tryouts with the song Sleepwalker . Despite winning the public vote, Nightwish eventually finished in second place, with the jury choosing local gospel singer Nina Astrom to represent Finland. In May 19, 2000, Nightwish released their third studio album, Wishmaster . This debuted at No. 1 on the Finnish album charts, and was certified gold in Finland after three weeks at number one. Critical response to the album was mixed, with Allmusic citing the album as repetitive, and saying >>as a whole album, it can be a little annoying, even frustrating<<. However, German magazine Rock Hard declared Wishmaster Album of the Month , despite competing against long-awaited May releases from Iron Maiden and Bon Jovi. Following the release of Wishmaster , Nightwish embarked on their first world tour, playing dates in South America, Mexico, Canada, and the first headlining European tour with Sinergy and Eternal Tears of Sorrow. In the summer, the band returned to Europe, appearing at the Wacken Open Air festival and the Biebop Metal Fest. 1. 4 New bassist and symphonic elements (2001-2003) In 2001, Nightwish recorded a cover of Gary Moore's Over the Hills and Far Away together with two new songs ( 10th Man Down , unreleased from Oceanborn sessions, and Away , unreleased from Wishmaster sessions) and a remake of Astral Romance (from the Angels Fall First album) with Tony Kakko (Sonata Arctica) singing Tuomas' part. This new material was released as their first (and until 2009 the only) EP, Over the Hills and Far Away . The record also included guest performances by Tapio Wilska once again on 10th Man Down . Nightwish's version of Over the Hills and Far Away was well received by fans, becoming a frequent part of the band's live performances, but the other songs never had a great break-through and have not been re-released, with the exception of a live performance of 10th Man Down on End of Innocence with Marco Hietala (current bass player and male vocalist). In the same year, they also released (as VHS, DVD and CD) their first live album, From Wishes to Eternity , recorded during a show in Tampere, Finland, on December 29, 2000. Soon after the release of Over the Hills and Far Away , Nightwish met what has been described as one of their hardest points as a band. The issues centered on the bassist, Sami Vanska, who had started misbehaving towards the band, according to Holopainen, by missing appointments and failing to take gigs as seriously as the other members did. After the band discussed of his behavior with Vanska several times, without getting any change, everyone simply stopped caring and tensions grew. Meanwhile, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen had started complaining about his role in the band, feeling like >>a hired gun who would only do what he's asked to<<. According to their music teacher, Plamen Dimov, he and Holopainen have totally different characters, and thus difficulties were expected to arise. But Vuorinen was told to stay cool and >>bite the bullet<<, and the problem was never addressed again. Later, Holopainen confessed that, at that time, he seriously started thinking about breaking Nightwish up. After a gig in Russia, he sent a text message to fellow musician Tony Kakko of metal band Sonata Arctica, telling him that he did not think he had a band any longer, and asking him what plans he had for next year. After Nightwish'&#x27;s last gig for the Over the Hills and Far Away tour in 2001, Holopainen called their labels Drakkar and Spinefarm, unofficially declaring Nightwish was over. He told them he might produce another album, but he'd never perform another show with the band. The same message was also written on the band's message board. Straight after the last gig, Holopainen went on a week-long hiking trip to Lapland with Tony Kakko. During the hiking trip, they talked about the band and Holopainen decided he could not break up Nightwish that easily. When he returned from Lapland he immediately received a phone call from Ewo Pohjola, CEO of Spinefarm, offering himself to become their manager and help him straighten things up, and Holopainen agreed. In order to continue with Nightwish, Holopainen decided some changes were in order. Beside choosing Ewo as their new manager, he also asked Vanska to leave the band. Marco Hietala (Tarot) was asked to replace Vanska, effectively leaving his previous band Sinergy. As well as playing bass guitar, Hietala would also perform male vocals. Holopainen has since said publicly that he and Vanska still keep in touch, contrary to rumours saying that they have not met since. However, they are not interested in making another project together. In 2002, Nightwish released Century Child , along with the singles Ever Dream and Bless the Child . The main difference from previous albums is the use of a live Finnish orchestra on the tracks Bless the Child , Ever Dream , Feel For You and The Beauty of the Beast . An enduring favorite of fans, though, is the band's version of The Phantom of the Opera , from the famous musical of the same name by composer Andrew Lloyd Webber. The song was repeatedly played on concerts until vocalist Tarja Turunen was replaced with Anette Olzon, whereupon the band announced that they would never play the song live again. Century Child was certified gold two hours after its release, and platinum two weeks afterwards. It set a record on the Finnish album charts as well: Never before had a first place album been so distant from the second place. After the Bless the Child music video, a second one was recorded, without any single support. The chosen track was End of All Hope . The clip contains pieces from the Finnish movie Kohtalon kirja (English: The Book of Fate). In 2003, Nightwish released their second DVD, the documentary End of Innocence . It tells the story of the band in Holopainen, Nevalainen and Tapio Wilska's words for two hours. The documentary also features bits of live concerts, exclusive footage, etc. Vocalist Tarja Turunen also got married during the summer of 2003, and there were rumours that the band was about to be dissolved. These rumours were, at the time, proven to be false, as the band continued to play concerts for another year and released another album. Tarja's marriage later played a part in her dismissal from the band in the autumn of 2005. 1. 5 Chart-topping success of Once (2004) A new album, Once , was released on June 7, 2004, along with the first single, Nemo (Latin: \"No one\"), from that album. The single topped the charts in Finland and Hungary, and reached the charts in six additional countries. Nemo remains the band's most successful single release to date. Once utilizes a full orchestra in nine of the eleven songs on the album. Unlike Century Child , Nightwish decided to look for an orchestra outside of Finland this time, choosing the London Philharmonic Orchestra. It is also their second album to feature a full-length song in Finnish, Kuolema tekee taiteilijan (Finnish: \"Death Makes an Artist\"). Once has sold triple platinum in Finland, platinum in Germany and Gold in six other countries, it also reached No. 1 in the Greek, Norwegian and German album charts, and charted the Top Ten in France, Hungary and Sweden. The following singles were: Wish I Had an Angel (featured on the soundtrack of the film Alone in the Dark ), Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan (released only in Finland and Japan) and The Siren . Besides the commercial success, Once was also well received by critics, with many positive reviewers drawing comparisons with Oceanborn . The success of the album allowed them to perform Once Upon a Tour , taking them to play in many countries the band had never visited before. Nightwish performed at the opening ceremony of the 2005 World Championships in Athletics, held in Helsinki, highlighting the acclaim the band had gained. A \"best of\" album, Highest Hopes , was released in September 2005. The compilation also featured a live cover High Hopes]/track] (from the Pink Floyd album The Division Bell ). Besides High Hopes , a remake of Sleeping Sun (from Oceanborn ) was included on the album and released as a single. A video for the remake was shot, featuring a medieval battle, and can be found on the German release of the single and as a separate DVD released by Spinefarm. 1. 6 Turunen&#x27;s dismissal (2005) The four other members of Nightwish had decided that it was best to continue Nightwish without Turunen. After a concert in the Hartwall Areena (Helsinki) on October 21, 2005, recorded for the live album End of an Era (released June 2006), they expressed their decision through an open letter which was given to Turunen by Holopainen, and afterwards posted on the band's website. It was written by Holopainen and signed by all four band members. The main justification given in the letter for Turunen's dismissal was that the band felt that both her husband Marcelo Cabuli (an Argentine businessman) and commercial interests had changed her attitude towards the band. Turunen responded to the incident twice, during press conferences in Finland and Germany, saying that her dismissal came entirely as a shock to her, given that she had not been notified before the letter was given to her. She felt that the personal attacks on her husband were unwarranted, and that playing the issue out in public was >>senselessly cruel<<. She expressed these feelings through her own open letter, which was published on her personal website, and through various TV, magazine, and newspaper interviews. 1. 7 Hiatus and new lead singer (2006-2009) In order to find a replacement for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on March 17, 2006 the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation began to emerge about who would eventually be chosen, and the band stated on their website that fans should not believe any source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist. In the end, the 35-year-old Alyson Avenue's ex-lead singer, Anette Olzon, from Sweden, was chosen. In September 2006, the band entered the studio to record their sixth studio album, Dark Passion Play . In May, next year, Anette Olzon was announced to replace Turunen. Holopainen has said in interviews that he did not wish to reveal her identity until new material was available because he did not want fans judging her by nothing more than a picture, or past work. The day after this revealing, May 25, 2007, charity single Eva was released for download only as the first offering from the new album, and the first featuring Olzon. It was originally scheduled for release on May 30, but the date was changed because of a leak on a British music download site. On June 13, Nightwish revealed the title and artwork for the new album on their official website, as well as the name and cover of the second single , Amaranth ; it was released in Finland on August 22 and included a bonus track entitled While Your Lips Are Still Red written by Tuomas as the main theme track for the upcoming Finnish feature film Lieksa! . The single achieved gold status in Finland after less than two days in stores. Dark Passion Play was released around Europe in the last week of September, 2007, in the UK on October 1, and the United States on October 2. It was awarded double platinum in Finland the second day after its release and took the number one position on the charts of Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Hungary and Croatia and got in top 100 in other 16 countries, including the United States. On this album, male vocalist Marco Hietala has more freedom in the use of his voice: he sings back up in the songs Cadence of Her Last Breath and Sahara , lead vocals in the songs The Islande , Master Passion Greed and While Your Lips Are Still Red , and chorus in the songs Bye Bye Beautiful and 7 Days to the Wolves . He also sings one part in The Poet and the Pendulum , besides singing back up in the chorus. Before the band found the new singer and the album was recorded, Marco sang on all the demo versions. Holopainen also sang on the demo versions of Bye Bye Beautiful and Master Passion Greed but these songs have never been released. On September 22, 2007, the band hosted a secret concert at Rock Cafe in Tallinn, Estonia, disguising itself as a Nightwish cover band called Nachtwasser. Their first official concert with Olzon was in Tel Aviv, Israel, on October 6, 2007. The Dark Passion Play tour thus started, visiting the United States, Canada, most of Europe, Asia, and Australia. The third single of the album was Eramaan viimeinen , a previously unreleased vocal version of the instrumental Last of the Wilds . It was released in Finland only on December 5, 2007. On this song, Jonsu of the Finnish pop and rock band Indica performs the Finnish vocals. Bye Bye Beautiful , the fourth single, was released on February 15, 2008, and concerns the 2005 dismissal of Turunen, as does one other song on the album, Master Passion Greed . The single includes yet another bonus track, Escapist , which is also included on the Japanese version of Dark Passion Play . Within a week after the release, the fifth single was announced to be The Islander . It was released over a month after the release of its music video, shot in late 2007 in Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland. The Dark Passion Play tour turned out to be Nightwish's longest tour yet, lasting from the fall of 2007 to September 2009 when it ended with a concert in Hartwall Arena - the band's second concert there - with the band Apocalyptica. On March 6, 2009,Nightwish released a new live EP entitled Made in Hong Kong (And in Various Other Places) . The eight live tracks were recorded during the Dark Passion Play World Tour in 2007-2008, and the album also includes one b-side from the Bye Bye Beautiful single, one b-side from the Amaranth single, a previously unreleased demo version of Cadence of Her Last Breath , and a bonus-DVD with three music videos as well as a 37 minute documentary called Back in the Day is Now . 1. 8 Imaginaerum , Olzon's dismissal (2009-2012) In the June 2009 edition of the Finnish magazine Soundi, Holopainen stated that he had started work on a new Nightwish album. In October 2009, rumors about the new album's name were going around with the title Wind Embraced , but lead vocalist Anette Olzon listed the rumors as >>not true<< and said that the songs for the new album had not yet been completed apart from 3 songs written before May 2009. Holopainen said in a 2010 interview that >>I can't reveal to you anymore but there is going to be a big twist so to say, on the next album. << In an interview with uillean piper Troy Donockley (who recorded with the band on Dark Passion Play ), when asked about his involvement in the new album, he stated >>Oh yes, I will be playing on the next album and from what Tuomas has told me, it is going to be something extraordinary. . . << On February 1, 2010, Olzon stated on her blog that Holopainen had nine songs ready for the new album. She also stated that the band will be meeting in the summer to make a demo, and fans should not expect anything any earlier than fall of 2011. In April, 2010, Holopainen revealed on the Nightwish homepage that he had finished writing the songs, and on June 2, it was announced that he had finished recording the pre-production demo. The band announced in late 2010 that more information of the album's actual content would be released in late January, but on February 1, the official website bore a statement written by Holopainen that because of the schedule changes he can't yet give away as much details as he would have wanted, but more information will be out after a couple of months. He added, however, that >>it still is the Burton-Gaiman-Dali-amusement-park we are about to enter<<; In the same statement it was revealed that the album will be a theme album and >>mood changes seem to be more present than ever before<<, and the orchestration demos he had received from Pip Williams were described as >>beautiful, twisted, tribal and cinematic stuff<<. In the Finnish version of the statement, it was also revealed that a few songs will not get any orchestrations at all, differing from their latest album on which all songs had the background orchestra. Announcements continued throughout 2011. On February 10, Nightwish announced on their website that the new album title would be Imaginaerum . They also declared that the band had been preparing a movie based on the album, which would be released in 2012 and directed by Stobe Harju, who previously directed the music video for The Islander . On August 22, 2011, it was announced on their official website that the album of Imaginaerum would be released at the end of the year. On August 31, Nightwish announced on their website their decision to change Imaginarium title to Imaginaerum >>In order to avoid mix-ups with various things named IMAGINARIUM <<. Then on September 2, Nightwish announced on their website that the new single called Storytime will be released on Friday, November 11 and on September 9, Nightwish revealed the cover and tracklist. On January 11, 2012, Nightwish announced on their website that the second single The Crow, the Owl and the Dove would be released on February 29. Roadrunner Records announced that Nightwish would be releasing a 10'' LP titled Trials of Imaginaerum in conjunction with Record Store Day (April 21, 2012). The 10'' LP is a two sided picture disk, which contains four early demos of Storytime , The Crow, The Owl and The Dove , I Want My Tears Back and Slow, Love, Slow . On October 1 2012, Nightwish announced via their Facebook page that they were parting ways with Olzon. According to the press statement, >>it has become increasingly obvious that the direction and the needs of the band were in conflict, and this has led to a division from which we cannot recover<<. This announcement came days after Olzon fell ill and was unable to perform; Nightwish used replacement singers from the opening band, Kamelot, and Olzon later expressed her disappointment, saying >>I was never asked if it was OK that they used Elize and Alissa in the show night I don't think it's a good decision they made and I'm sorry for those of you who came to see the whole band but got something else. But I was very ill and this decision wasn't mine. << According to the statement, Floor Jansen (ex-After Forever, ReVamp) will sing for the remainder of the Imaginaerum World Tour. On January 11, 2013, Olzon announced on her official blog that she was pregnant with her third child, due in spring 2013. This was a contributing factor to her being dismissed. The band then released a statement on their website declaring that the reason Olzon gave for her dismissal and other statements she made were untrue and that Olzon herself had agreed to help find a replacement while she was on maternity leave. Later on, Olzon gave several interviews in which she told that she never agreed with a replacement, even when she was pregnant, and proposed to the band to postpone the tour, culminating on her firing. She also added that she was against Jansen joining the band in her period of maternity, mainly because the difference of their vocal styles. 1. 9 Endless Forms Most Beautiful, arrival of Floor Jansen and Troy Donockley (2013-present) In an interview with Metal Hammer in November 2012, Tuomas Holopainen stated that they already had a rehearsal place booked from July 2014 to September 2014, but before they began rehearsing the band members would be taking a break from Nightwish for several months. On 9 October, 2013, Nightwish announced Dutch singer Floor Jansen as the permanent replacement for Olzon. Troy Donockley has also been announced as a full-time member, making the band a sextet for the first time. According to the band's webpage, the band would enter the studio in 2014 to record their eighth full-length album for a 2015 release. This album was set to contain Nightwish's longest song to date. At the end of November, the band released the live album Showtime, Storytime . Despite the recording happening when they were only tour members, it is the first Nightwish release to feature Jansen, and to have her and Donockley credited as band members. The album also carries a documentary containing the behind-the-scenes of Jansen's first days in the band and the process of replacing Olzon. In May, 2014, Tuomas updated his official website, stating that he and producer Tero >>TeeCee<< Kinnunen have been recording 12 demos (and possibly 3 bonus tracks) for the new album in Hattula, Finland. The band expected to start rehearsing in July in Eno, Finland, with the recording finished on January 2015, and the album released in Spring that year, >>If everything goes as scheduled<<. Commenting on the music, Tuomas said: >>It's still too early to analyze the material more closely, but the album will once again explore all the ends of the spectrum, bringing the very best out of the newcomers Floor and Troy. And stealthily the album ended up having a theme running through it. << On August 6, the band announced that founding member and drummer Jukka Nevalainen would not be part of the upcoming album due to his very difficult insomnia. Kai Hahto (Wintersun) would be taking his place in the album and the upcoming tour. Evolutionary biologist and author Richard Dawkins will be a guest star on the album, with Holopainen stating that he had >>been so enthusiastic about this kind of literature for the past few months, and will be for the upcoming months, that it's going to come out somehow. << In November, the band filmed a music video for Elan , one of the tracks of the album. On December 8, the band announced that it would be the first single from the album, which would be released on February 13, 2015. The new album's cover art and its title, Endless Forms Most Beautiful, were revealed on December 22, along with a release date of March 27, 2015. ", "DAY6": "", "Anathema": "There is more than one artist with the name Anathema. 1) Anathema is a band from Liverpool, England, UK primarily known as one of the pioneering and leading death doom metal acts, incorporating growling, poetic lyrics and complex arrangements into the traditional doom riffage. Later in their career, beginning with &quot;Eternity&quot;, they moved away from this sound into more melodic, atmospheric rock. Anathema formed in 1990 as a doom metal band, initially under the name Pagan Angel. In November of that year, the band recorded their first demo, entitled &quot;An Iliad of Woes&quot;. This demo caught the attention of several bands from the English metal scene, allowing Anathema to play gigs with bands like Bolt Thrower and Paradise Lost. At the beginning of 1991, the band adopted its current name, and gained a lot of attention with the release of their second demo entitled &quot;All Faith Is Lost&quot;, resulting in a four-album deal with Peaceville Records. Their first release under the label was &quot;The Crestfallen EP&quot; in November 1992. They took the material from that album on the road, touring with Cannibal Corpse. &quot;Serenades&quot;, Anathema&#x27;s debut LP, attracted a lot of mainstream attention, propelling their &quot;Sweet Tears&quot; music video onto the MTV playlist. Anathema&#x27;s first European tour was in 1994, and was closely followed by gigs at the Independent Rock Festival in Brazil. In May 1995, vocalist Darren White parted with the band, eventually forming The Blood Divine. Rather than recruiting a new vocalist, the band decided that guitarist Vincent Cavanagh should assume White&#x27;s role. This new formation debuted by touring with Cathedral in the United Kingdom. The release of &quot;Eternity&quot; came in 1996, relying more on atmospheric sounds, and starting the transition to clean vocals; the album &quot;Judgement&quot; would later consolidate this style. A European tour followed the album&#x27;s release. The second member to leave the band was drummer John Douglas, who departed in the summer of 1997. He was replaced by Shaun Taylor-Steels, formerly of Solstice, who would also later play drums for My Dying Bride. &quot;Alternative 4&quot; was released in 1998. During this time the band underwent many line-up changes. Bassist/songwriter Duncan Patterson quit due to musical differences and was replaced by Dave Pybus of Dreambreed, where Duncan had played bass for a short period. Martin Powell (who had played keyboards and violin for My Dying Bride previously) also joined the band. Finally, John Douglas returned to the drums. In June 1999, the album &quot;Judgement&quot; was released, marking Anathema&#x27;s complete shift from the doom metal genre, focusing instead on slower and more experimental songs. This new sound has been likened to artists such as Pink Floyd, Jeff Buckley, and to a lesser extent, Radiohead. However, the essence of the band remained the same. Their songs continued to express a feeling of depression and, more often than not, desperation. During the same year Martin Powell switched positions with Cradle of Filth&#x27;s keyboardist Les Smith, who came to be an integral member of Anathema. Shortly before the release of A Fine Day to Exit, Dave Pybus announced his departure from the band and later joined Cradle of Filth. He was replaced by touring bassist George Roberts, and later by Jamie Cavanagh. In March 2002, Daniel Cavanagh announced his departure from the band, joining Duncan Patterson&#x27;s band Antimatter. However, he later rejoined Anathema in 2003 for the release of &quot;A Natural Disaster&quot;, and started their European Tour. This accelerated the changes in Anathema&#x27;s tone towards the atmospheric and progressive, as exhibited in album tracks &quot;Flying&quot; and &quot;Violence&quot;. Upon the closing of their label Music for Nations after its purchase by Sony BMG, Anathema found itself without a record label, despite having completed an extensive tour of the UK with popular Finnish rock band HIM in April 2006. During their search for a new label, the band have adopted a more &#x27;DIY&#x27; approach to music release, embracing the internet and releasing songs via their own website, for which fans may donate a monetary sum of their own choice. Despite the obvious lack of label-based tour support, the band continues to play dates across Europe, guitarist Danny Cavanagh also playing the odd low-key acoustic concert. The latest album and first in seven years, &quot;We&#x27;re Here Because We&#x27;re Here&quot;, was released on May 31, 2010. The album was mixed by Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, who has described it as \"definitely among the best albums I've ever had the pleasure to work on. \". The album was proclaimed &quot;Prog Album of the Year&quot; by Classic Rock magazine , describing it as &quot;A flawless, life-affirming comeback and a gold-plated contender for album of the year&quot;. Ville Valo of the band HIM recorded vocals for the song &quot;Angels Walk Among Us&quot;. On July 6, 2011, it was announced on the band&#x27;s official page that their album of re-interpretations, &quot;Falling Deeper&quot;, will be released on September 5, 2011. The album will be a follow-up to Hindsight and will contain new orchestral versions of songs from the past, as well as a version of &quot;Everwake&quot; featuring the vocals of Anneke van Giersbergen. On September 12th, Les Smith&#x27;s departure due to &quot;creative and musical differences&quot; was announced on the band&#x27;s website. On 16 April 2012, the band&#x27;s ninth studio album, Weather Systems, was released via Kscope. The album entered the UK album charts at No. 50 and the German album charts at No. 19. On 8 November 2012, Daniel Cavanagh announces at Anathema&#x27;s official homepage that Daniel Cardoso is joining the band as a full-time permanent basis as a key element of the band. On 2 December 2012, Anathema announced their first concert in India. Anathema has performed at IIT Madras as part of the Saarang Rock Show on 12 January 2013. The band&#x27;s recent live album, named Untouchable, was released as a double vinyl album on 24 June 2013. The album is a recording of a special one-off gig at the ancient Roman theatre of Philippopolis in 2012, where the band were joined by the Plovdiv Philharmonic Orchestra. The set was released on Blu-ray, DVD and CD under the name Universal, with an alternate track order, on 17 September 2013. According to the bands official Facebook site they are currently recording their new album in Norway and it will be released in 2014. On 28 March 2014, the band announced their upcoming studio album to be called Distant Satellites. The album came out on 9 June on the Kscope label, and is produced by Christer-Andre Cederberg in Oslo, Norway. Several tracks were mixed by Steven Wilson. Different from previous albums is the use of more electronica on this album. The album is released in 4 different versions, a cd, vinyl, Media Book, and a Deluxe version. Tour dates have been announced starting 22 May in Istanbul, Turkey, then throughout Europe and 3 dates in August 2014 in Australia.

They released one demo, &quot;Spiral of Hatred&quot; in 1990. ", "Siouxsie and the Banshees": "Siouxsie and the Banshees were an influential rock band which formed in 1976 in London, England. Initially associated with the British punk rock scene, the band quickly evolved to create &quot;a form of post-punk discord full of daring rhythmic and sonic experimentation&quot;. The Times cited Siouxsie and the Banshees as &quot;one of the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era. &quot; After their split in 1996, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie continued to record music as The Creatures, a second band they had formed in the early 1980s. In 2004, Siouxsie began a solo career. Their first single Hong Kong Garden reached the top ten in the UK in the summer of 1978. Their first album, The Scream (1978), is today considered as a classic. The NME wrote in its review : &quot;The band sounds like some unique hybrid of the Velvet Underground mated with much of the ingenuity of Tago Mago-era Can, if any parallel can be drawn&#8230;Certainly, the traditional three-piece sound has never been used in a more unorthodox fashion with such stunning results. &quot; Indeed, Switch placed them as pioneers of the post-punk bands.  Their second album was Join Hands (1979); perhaps the darkest album. Guitarist McKay and drummer Morris left the band shortly after its release.  This change allowed the Banshees to play a different music. They recruited the drummer Budgie and the gifted guitarist John McGeoch, formerly of Magazine (his work with the Banshees was later praised by Radiohead and The Smiths). John McGeoch played on the three following albums. Kaleidoscope (1980), including Happy House and Christine, showed a brand new musical departure with liquid guitars and atmospheric synthesizers : this eclectic record was a success and reached the top 5 in the national UK charts. One year later in 1981, Juju with the vibrant Spellbound, was another success.  The last session McGeoch recorded with the band was for the Slowdive single from the 1982&#x27;s classic A Kiss In The Dreamhouse. The British press greeted this album enthusiastically. The NME finished its review with this sentence : &quot;I promise. This music will take your breath away. &quot; But McGeoch, worn by the recording process of these songs, was hospitalized on his return from a promotional trip to Madrid. At the same era, Siouxsie and drummer Budgie created another band, The Creatures, to record music more based on percussion. In late 1982, McGeoch was replaced by Robert Smith (from The Cure) : Smith became a full-time member between 1982 and 1984. He contributed to the classic live album and DVD Nocturne (1983) and to the studio album Hyaena (1984) as co-composer.  Guitarist John Valentine Carruthers from Clock DVA replaced Smith in May 1984. He played on the successful Tinderbox album (1986), including the first hit-single of the band in the US Cities In Dust. The covers album Through The Looking Glass (1987) with This Wheel&#x27;s On Fire, allowed the band to broaden their sound.  Following a lengthy break, the rest of the band recruited another new guitarist Jon Klein (Specimen) and the multi-instrumentalist McCarrick to record Peepshow (1988). The hit-single Peek-A-Boo was considered as avant-garde with its abrasive sounds.  After the most impressive tour of their career, the band stopped for a while and the second band of Siouxsie and Budgie The Creatures reappeared with another album, the critically acclaimed Boomerang (1989). One of the most languorous songs from this record, Killing Time, was covered live by Jeff Buckley a few years later.  In 1991, the Banshees returned with the single, Kiss Them For Me, mixing Beatles strings over a dance rhythm. This single peaked in the U. S. singles charts at number 23, allowing them to reach a new audience. Melody Maker praised the last two studio albums Superstition (1991) and The Rapture (1995- partially produced by John Cale) including a swansong called Forever.  Morrissey recorded a duet with Siouxsie called Interlude. This one-off single was published under the banner of the two artists names.  After the split of the band in 1996, the box set, Downside Up, was released, compiling 51 unreleased B-sides and the highly praised out-of-print &quot;The Thorn&quot; mini LP. Most of these numbers like Something Wicked (This Way Comes) and Red Over White (The Thorn) are considered by fans as classics.  After carried on recording as The Creatures, Siouxsie released her first solo album Mantaray in 2007 : the record was hailed by both Pitchfork and Mojo.  Influence On Other Artists Siouxsie and the Banshees influenced musicians across many genres.  The band had a strong impact on Trip Hop acts : * Tricky covered &quot;Tattoo&quot; to open his second solo album Nearly God. Here&#x27;s his version: Tattoo. The original version of &quot;Tattoo&quot; was recorded in 1983 and is available on the Banshees Downside Up box set. * Massive Attack covered and sampled the music of Metal Postcard on their song &quot;Superpredators (Metal Postcard)&quot; for the movie soundtrack The Jackal.  Siouxsie and the Banshees also inspired the following artists : * LCD Soundsystem covered &quot;Slowdive&quot; for the cd-single &quot;Disco Infiltrator&quot;. Here&#x27;s the original Slowdive and the LCD Soundsystem version Slowdive (XFM session) * Jeff Buckley covered live a Siouxsie / The Creatures song called &#x27;Killing Time&#x27; originally composed in 1989 on the album Boomerang. Here&#x27;s the original Killing Time. * Morrissey stated this in &#x27;GQ&#x27; in 1994 : &quot;None of them are as good as Siouxsie and the Banshees at full pelt. That&#x27;s not dusty nostalgia, that&#x27;s fact. &quot; * The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr from The Smiths stated on the BBC radio 2 in february&#x27;2008 that he rated very high McGeoch for his work on Spellbound. * Garbage singer Shirley Manson wrote in the foreword of the official Siouxsie and the Banshees biography in 2003 by Mojo magazine journalist Mark Paytress : &quot;I learned how to sing listening to The Scream and Kaleidoscope. &quot; * Radiohead bassist Colin Greenwood claims that while recording their song &quot;There There&quot;, producer Nigel Godrich tried to get guitarist Jonny Greenwood to sound like the Banshees&#x27; John McGeoch.  * PJ Harvey selected in her top ten favourite albums of year 1999 : Anima Animus by The Creatures. aka Siouxsie. *Jane&#x27;s Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro also makes a parallel between his band and the Banshees in Siouxsie&#x27;s official biography: &quot;There are so many similar threads : melody, use of sound, attitude, sex-appeal. I always saw Jane&#x27;s Addiction as the masculine Siouxsie and the Banshees. &quot; *The Beta Band sampled the bridge of Painted Bird on their track Liquid Bird from the Heroes to Zeros album. *Red Hot Chili Peppers covered Christine live at the V2001 festival. In 2002, their guitarist John Frusciante stated in an article featured on Total Guitar Magazine about Banshees guitarist John McGeoch : &quot;He's just a great guitar player, full stop. I wanted to listen to these people who weren't just about technique but more about textures. People like John McGeoch. People who used good chords. &quot; also declaring that John McGeoch was an influence for the sound on the Red Hot Chili Peppers album By The Way.  *The Mars Volta covered Pulled to Bits (Live At The Royal Albert Hall) for the &#x27;Wax Simulacra&#x27; single. *Arcade Fire singer Win Butler suggested to the band Devotchka to cover the 1988 Siouxsie song : The Last Beat Of My Heart. One can listen to the Devothcka version on their Curse Your Little Heart ep. * The Cure leader Robert Smith declared in 2003 in Mark Paytress&#x27;s Siouxsie biography : &quot;Siouxsie and The Banshees and Wire were the two bands I really admired. They meant something. &quot; He also pinpointed what the Join Hands tour brought him musically. &quot;On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was Blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with The Cure. Before that, I&#x27;d wanted us to be like The Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello, the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing. &quot; He also talked about the band to Steve Sutherland in 1985 to describe &quot;The Head On the Door&quot; : &quot;It reminds me of the Kaleidoscope album, the idea of having lots of different sounding things, different colors. &quot; *U2 selected Christine for a compilation made for Mojo and The Edge presented an award to Siouxsie at a Mojo ceremony in 2005. www. siouxsie. com Split in 2002", "Freundeskreis": "Freundeskreis, also known as FK, are a German Hip-Hop group from Stuttgart, active from 1996 until 2007, whose songs are in German but also in English, Esperanto and French. The group consists of Maximilian Herre, Don Philippe and DJ Friction. Freundeskreis are primarily known for their political lyrics, in which they advocate equality and international understanding. Their singles ANNA and Mit Dir (with Maximilian&#x27;s ex- wife Joy Denalane) were also commercially successful and lifted the group into the German charts. See also: FK Allstars", "Royal Blood": "Formed at the beginning of 2013, Royal Blood are a 2-piece band from Brighton, East Sussex, UK. Having known each other for years in different bands, Mike Kerr (Bassist/Vocalist) &amp; Ben Thatcher (Drums) finally came together and went into the studio to record 'Figure It Out' - the first track that brought attention to the band. At the tail end of 2013, Royal Blood released 'Out of The Black', their debut single on Black Mammoth Records. The band released their debut album &#x27;&#x27;Royal Blood'&#x27; on 22 August, 2014 which sold 66,000 copies in its first week. ", "Pearl Jam": "Pearl Jam is an American rock band that formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1990. Since its inception, the band&#x27;s line-up has included Stone Gossard (guitar), Jeff Ament (bass), Mike McCready (guitar), and Eddie Vedder (vocals). The band&#x27;s fifth and current drummer is Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden, who has been with the band since 1998. Formed after the demise of Gossard and Ament&#x27;s previous band, Mother Love Bone, Pearl Jam broke into the mainstream with its debut album, Ten, in 1991. One of the key bands of the grunge movement in the early 1990s, over the course of the band&#x27;s career, its members became noted for their refusal to adhere to traditional music industry practices, including refusing to make music videos, giving interviews and engaging in a much-publicized boycott of Ticketmaster. In 2006, Rolling Stone described the band as having &quot;spent much of the past decade deliberately tearing apart their own fame. &quot; To date, the band has sold more than 31. 5 million records in the U. S, and an estimated 60 million worldwide. Pearl Jam has outlasted and outsold many of its contemporaries from the alternative rock breakthrough of the early 1990s, and is considered one of the most influential bands of the decade. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic referred to Pearl Jam as &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the &#x27;90s. &quot; Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament were members of pioneering grunge band Green River during the mid-1980s. Green River toured and recorded to moderate success but disbanded in 1987 due to a stylistic division between the pair and bandmates Mark Arm and Steve Turner. In late 1987, Gossard and Ament began playing with Malfunkshun vocalist Andrew Wood, eventually organizing the band Mother Love Bone. In 1988 and 1989, the band recorded and toured to increasing interest and found the support of the PolyGram record label, which signed the band in early 1989. Mother Love Bone&#x27;s debut album, Apple, was released in July 1990, four months after Wood died of a heroin overdose. Ament and Gossard were devastated by the death of Wood and the resulting demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested in joining the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position. Irons passed on the invitation but gave the demo to his basketball buddy, San Diego, California singer Eddie Vedder. Vedder was the lead vocalist for a San Diego band, Bad Radio, and worked part-time at a gas station. He listened to the tape shortly before going surfing, where lyrics came to him. He then recorded the vocals to three of the songs (&quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Once&quot;, and &quot;Footsteps&quot;) in what he later described as a &quot;mini-opera&quot; entitled Momma-Son. Vedder sent the tape with his vocals back to the three Seattle musicians, who were impressed enough to fly Vedder up to Seattle for an audition. Within a week, Vedder had joined the band. With the addition of Dave Krusen on drums, the band took the name Mookie Blaylock, in reference to the then-active All-Star basketball player. The band played its first official show at the Off Ramp Cafe in Seattle on October 22, 1990, and soon signed to Epic Records and renamed themselves Pearl Jam. In an early promotional interview, Vedder said that the name &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; was a reference to his great-grandmother Pearl, who was married to a Native American and had a special recipe for peyote-laced jam. In a 2006 Rolling Stone cover story however, Vedder admitted that this story was &quot;total bullshit&quot;, even though he indeed had a great-grandma named Pearl. Ament and McCready explained that Ament came up with &quot;pearl&quot;, and that the band later settled on &quot;Pearl Jam&quot; after attending a concert by Neil Young, in which he extended his songs as improvisations of 15-20 minutes in length. Pearl Jam entered Seattle&#x27;s London Bridge Studios in March 1991 to record its debut album, Ten McCready said that &quot;Ten was mostly Stone and Jeff; me and Eddie were along for the ride at that time. &quot; Krusen left the band in May 1991 after checking himself into rehabilitation; he was replaced by Matt Chamberlain, who had previously played with Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians. After playing only a handful of shows, one of which was filmed for the &quot;Alive&quot; video, Chamberlain left to join the Saturday Night Live band. Chamberlain suggested Dave Abbruzzese as his replacement. Abbruzzese joined the group and played the rest of Pearl Jam&#x27;s live shows supporting Ten. Released on August 27, 1991, Ten (named after Mookie Blaylock&#x27;s jersey number) contained eleven tracks dealing with dark subjects like depression, suicide, loneliness, and murder. Ten&#x27;s musical style, influenced by classic rock, combined an &quot;expansive harmonic vocabulary&quot; with an anthemic sound. The album was slow to sell, but by the second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, being certified gold and reaching number two on the Billboard charts. Ten produced the hit singles &quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot;, and &quot;Jeremy&quot;. Originally interpreted as an anthem by many, Vedder later revealed that &quot;Alive&quot; tells the semi-biographical tale of a son discovering that his father is actually his stepfather, while his mother's grief turns her to sexually embrace her son, who strongly resembles the biological father. The song &quot;Jeremy&quot; (About this sound sample (help*info)) and its accompanying video were inspired by a true story in which a high school student shot himself in front of his classmates. Ten stayed on the Billboard charts for more than two years, and has gone on to become one of the highest-selling rock records ever, going 13x platinum. With the success of Ten, Pearl Jam became a key member of the Seattle grunge explosion, along with Alice in Chains, Nirvana, and Soundgarden. The band was criticized in the music press; British music magazine NME said that Pearl Jam was &quot;trying to steal money from young alternative kids&#x27; pockets. &quot; Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain angrily attacked Pearl Jam, claiming the band were commercial sellouts, and argued Ten was not a true alternative album because it had so many prominent guitar leads. Cobain later reconciled with Vedder, and they reportedly were on amicable terms before Cobain&#x27;s death in 1994. Pearl Jam toured relentlessly in support of Ten. Ament stated that &quot;essentially Ten was just an excuse to tour,&quot; adding, &quot;We told the record company, &#x27;We know we can be a great band, so let&#x27;s just get the opportunity to get out and play. &#x27;&quot; The band&#x27;s manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, &quot;Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it. &quot; Early on in Pearl Jam&#x27;s career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that &quot;playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it&#x27;s just like an untamed force&#8230;But it didn&#x27;t come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates. &quot; In 1992, Pearl Jam made television appearances on Saturday Night Live and MTV Unplugged and took a slot on that summer&#x27;s Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, and Ministry, among others. The band contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the 1992 Cameron Crowe film Singles: &quot;State of Love and Trust&quot; and &quot;Breath&quot;. Ament, Gossard and Vedder appeared in Singles under the name &quot;Citizen Dick&quot;; their parts were filmed when Pearl Jam was known as Mookie Blaylock. The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam&#x27;s popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for &quot;Jeremy&quot;, including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for &quot;Black&quot; in spite of pressure by the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs, despite it being common knowledge that music videos were one of the most vital sales tools any band had in its arsenal. However, Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed the listener from creating their own interpretation of the song stating that &quot;Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression. &quot; &quot;Ten years from now,&quot; Ament said, &quot;I don&#x27;t want people to remember our songs as videos. &quot; Pearl Jam headed into the studio in early 1993 facing the challenge of following up the commercial success of its debut. McCready said, &quot;The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy. &quot; Released on October 19, 1993, Pearl Jam&#x27;s second album, Vs. , sold 950,378 copies in its first week of release and outperformed all other entries in the Billboard top ten that week combined. The album set the record for most copies of an album sold in its first week of release, which it held until broken by Garth Brooks&#x27; 1998 album, Double Live. Vs. included the singles &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Daughter&quot;, &quot;Animal&quot;, and &quot;Dissident&quot;. Paul Evans of Rolling Stone said, &quot;Few American bands have arrived more clearly talented than this one did with Ten; and Vs. tops even that debut. &quot; He added, &quot;Like Jim Morrison and Pete Townshend, Vedder makes a forte of his psychological-mythic explorations&#8230; As guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready paint dense and slashing backdrops, he invites us into a drama of experiment and strife. &quot; The band decided, beginning with the release of Vs. , to scale back its commercial efforts. The members declined to produce any more music videos after the massive success of &quot;Jeremy&quot; and opted for fewer interviews and television appearances. Industry insiders compared Pearl Jam&#x27;s tour that year to the touring habits of Led Zeppelin, in that the band &quot;ignored the press and took its music directly to the fans. &quot; During the Vs. Tour, the band set a cap on ticket prices in an attempt to thwart scalpers. By 1994, Pearl Jam was &quot;fighting on all fronts&quot;, as its manager described the band at the time. Reporter Chuck Philips broke a series of stories showing that Ticketmaster was gouging Pearl Jam&#x27;s customers. Pearl Jam was outraged when, after it played a pair of shows in Chicago, Illinois, it discovered that ticket vendor Ticketmaster had added a service charge to the tickets. Pearl Jam was committed to keeping their concert ticket prices down but Fred Rosen of Ticketmaster, refused to waive the service charge. Since Ticketmaster controlled most major venues, the band was forced to create from scratch its own outdoor stadiums in rural areas in order to perform. Pearl Jam's efforts to organize a tour without the ticket giant collapsed which Pearl Jam said was evidence of Ticketmaster's monopoly. An analysis of journalist Chuck Philips investigative series in a well known legal monograph concluded that it was hard to imagine a legitimate reason for Ticketmaster's exclusive contracts with venues and contracts which covered such a lengthy period of time. The authors said, \"The pervasiveness of Ticketmaster&#x27;s exclusive agreements, coupled with their excessive duration and the manner in which they are procured, supported a finding that Ticketmaster had engaged in anticompetitive conduct under section 2 of the Sherman Act. \" The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company&#x27;s practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company. Band members Gossard and Ament testified at a subcommittee investigation on June 30, 1994 in Washington, D. C. Pearl Jam alleged that Ticketmaster used anti-competitive and monopolistic practices to gouge fans. After Pearl Jam's testimony before Congress, Congressman Dingell (D-Mich. ) wrote a bill requiring full disclosure to prevent Ticketmaster from burying escalating service fees. Pearl Jam's manager said he was gratified that Congress recognized the problem as a national issue. The band eventually canceled its 1994 summer tour in protest. After the Justice Department dropped the case, Pearl Jam continued to boycott Ticketmaster, refusing to play venues that had contracts with the company. Music critic Jim DeRogatis noted that along with the Ticketmaster debacle, &quot;the band has refused to release singles or make videos; it has demanded that its albums be released on vinyl; and it wants to be more like its &#x27;60s heroes, The Who, releasing two or three albums a year. &quot; He also stated that sources said that most of the band&#x27;s third album Vitalogy was completed by early 1994, but that either a forced delay by Epic or the battle with Ticketmaster were to blame for the delay. Pearl Jam wrote and recorded while touring behind Vs. and the majority of the tracks for its next album, Vitalogy, were recorded during breaks on the tour. Tensions within the band had dramatically increased by this time. Producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien said, &quot;Vitalogy was a little strained. I&#x27;m being polite--there was some imploding going on. &quot; After Pearl Jam finished the recording of Vitalogy, drummer Dave Abbruzzese was fired. The band cited political differences between Abbruzzese and the other members; for example, Abbruzzese disagreed with the Ticketmaster boycott. He was replaced by Jack Irons, a close friend of Vedder and the former and original drummer of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Irons made his debut with the band at Neil Young&#x27;s 1994 Bridge School Benefit, but he was not officially announced as the band&#x27;s new drummer until its 1995 Self-Pollution satellite radio broadcast, a four-and-a-half-hour long pirate broadcast out of Seattle which was available to any radio stations that wanted to carry it. Vitalogy was released first on November 22, 1994 on vinyl and then two weeks later on December 6, 1994 on CD and cassette. The CD became the second-fastest-selling in history, with more than 877,000 units sold in its first week. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that &quot;thanks to its stripped-down, lean production, Vitalogy stands as Pearl Jam&#x27;s most original and uncompromising album. &quot; Many of the songs on the album appear to be based around the pressures of fame. The song &quot;Spin the Black Circle&quot;, an homage to vinyl records, won a Grammy Award in 1996 for Best Hard Rock Performance. Vitalogy also included the songs &quot;Not for You&quot;, &quot;Corduroy&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;, and &quot;Immortality&quot;. &quot;Better Man&quot; (sample (info)), a song originally written and performed by Vedder while in Bad Radio, reached number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart, spending a total of eight weeks there. Considered a &quot;blatantly great pop song&quot; by producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien, Pearl Jam was reluctant to record it and had initially rejected it from Vs. due to its accessibility. The band continued its boycott against Ticketmaster during its 1995 tour for Vitalogy, but was surprised that virtually no other bands joined in. Pearl Jam&#x27;s initiative to play only at non-Ticketmaster venues effectively, with a few exceptions, prevented it from playing shows in the United States for the next three years. Ament later said, &quot;We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career. &quot; In the same year Pearl Jam backed Neil Young, whom the band had noted as an influence, on his album Mirror Ball. Contractual obligations prevented the use of the band&#x27;s name anywhere on the album, but the members were all credited individually in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Two songs from the sessions were left off Mirror Ball: &quot;I Got Id&quot; and &quot;Long Road&quot;. These two tracks were released separately by Pearl Jam in the form of the 1995 EP, Merkin Ball. Following the round of touring for Vitalogy, the band went into the studio to record its follow-up, No Code. Vedder said, &quot;Making No Code was all about gaining perspective. &quot; Released in 1996, No Code was seen as a deliberate break from the band&#x27;s sound since Ten, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rockers. David Browne of Entertainment Weekly stated that &quot;No Code displays a wider range of moods and instrumentation than on any previous Pearl Jam album. &quot; The lyrical themes on the album deal with issues of self-examination, with Ament stating, &quot;In some ways, it&#x27;s like the band&#x27;s story. It&#x27;s about growing up. &quot; Although the album debuted at number one on the Billboard charts, it quickly fell down the charts. No Code included the singles &quot;Who You Are&quot; (About this sound sample (help*info)), &quot;Hail, Hail&quot;, and &quot;Off He Goes&quot;. As with Vitalogy, very little touring was done to promote No Code because of the band&#x27;s refusal to play in Ticketmaster&#x27;s venue areas. A European tour took place in the fall of 1996. Gossard stated that there was &quot;a lot of stress associated with trying to tour at that time&quot; and that &quot;it was growing more and more difficult to be excited about being part of the band. &quot; Following the short tour for No Code, the band went into the studio in 1997 to record its follow-up. The sessions for the band&#x27;s fifth album represented more of a team effort between all members of the group, with Ament stating that &quot;everybody really got a little bit of their say on the record&#8230;because of that, everybody feels like they&#x27;re an integral part of the band. &quot; On February 3, 1998, Pearl Jam released its fifth album, Yield. The album was cited as a return to the band&#x27;s early, straightforward rock sound. Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly stated that the band has &quot;turned in an intermittently affecting album that veers between fiery garage rock and rootsy, acoustic-based ruminations. Perhaps mindful of their position as the last alt-rock ambassadors with any degree of clout, they&#x27;ve come up with their most cohesive album since their 1991 debut, Ten. &quot; Lyrically, Yield continued with the more contemplative type of writing found on No Code, with Vedder saying, &quot;What was rage in the past has become reflection. &quot; Yield debuted at number two on the Billboard charts, but like No Code soon began dropping down the charts. It included the singles &quot;Given to Fly&quot; and &quot;Wishlist&quot;. The band hired comic book artist Todd McFarlane to create an animated video for the song &quot;Do the Evolution&quot; from the album, its first music video since 1992. A documentary detailing the making of Yield, Single Video Theory, was released on VHS and DVD later that year. In April 1998, Pearl Jam once again changed drummers. Jack Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring and was replaced with former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron on an initially temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. Pearl Jam&#x27;s 1998 Yield Tour in North America marked the band's return to full-scale touring. The band&#x27;s anti-trust lawsuit against Ticketmaster had proven to be unsuccessful and hindered live tours. Many fans had complained about the difficulty in obtaining tickets and the use of non-Ticketmaster venues, which were judged to be out-of-the-way and impersonal. For this tour and future tours, Pearl Jam once again began using Ticketmaster in order to &quot;better accommodate concertgoers. &quot; The 1998 summer tour was a big success, and after it was completed the band released Live on Two Legs, a live album which featured select performances from the tour. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was recorded during a soundcheck and released on the band&#x27;s 1998 fan club Christmas single. The following year, the cover was put into heavy rotation across the country. By popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999, with all of the proceeds going to the aid of refugees of the Kosovo War. The band also decided to include the song on the 1999 charity compilation album, No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees. &quot;Last Kiss&quot; peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting single. Following its full-scale tour in support of Yield, the band took a short break, but then reconvened toward the end of 1999 and commenced work on a new album. On May 16, 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, Binaural. It was drummer Matt Cameron&#x27;s studio recording debut with the band. The title is a reference to the binaural recording techniques that were utilized on several tracks by producer Tchad Blake, known for his use of the technique. Binaural was the first album since the band&#x27;s debut not produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, although O&#x27;Brien was called in later to remix several tracks. Gossard stated that the band members &quot;were ready for a change. &quot; Jon Pareles of Rolling Stone said, &quot;Apparently as tired of grunge as everyone except Creed fans, Pearl Jam delve elsewhere. &quot; He added, &quot;The album reflects both Pearl Jam&#x27;s longstanding curse of self-importance and a renewed willingness to be experimental or just plain odd. &quot; The album is lyrically darker than the band&#x27;s previous album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as &quot;pretty sombre. &quot; Binaural included the singles &quot;Nothing as It Seems&quot; (About this sound sample (help*info)), one of the songs featuring binaural recording, and &quot;Light Years&quot;. The album sold just over 700,000 copies and became the first Pearl Jam studio album to fail to reach platinum status. Pearl Jam decided to record every show on its 2000 Binaural Tour professionally, after noting the desire of fans to own a copy of the shows they attended and the popularity of bootleg recordings. The band had been open in the past about allowing fans to make amateur recordings, and these &quot;official bootlegs&quot; were an attempt to provide a more affordable and better quality product for fans. Pearl Jam originally intended to release them to only fan club members, but the band&#x27;s record contract prevented it from doing so. Pearl Jam released all of the albums in record stores as well as through its fan club. The band released 72 live albums in 2000 and 2001, and twice set a record for most albums to debut in the Billboard 200 at the same time. Pearl Jam&#x27;s 2000 European tour ended in tragedy on June 30, with an accident at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark. Nine fans were crushed underfoot and suffocated to death as the crowd rushed to the front. After numerous requests for the crowd to step back, the band stopped playing and tried to calm the crowd when the musicians realized what was happening, but it was already too late. The two remaining dates of the tour were canceled and members of the band contemplated retiring after this event. Pearl Jam was initially blamed for the accident, but was later cleared of responsibility. A month after the European tour concluded, the band embarked on its two-leg 2000 North American tour. On performing after the Roskilde tragedy, Vedder said that &quot;playing, facing crowds, being together--it enabled us to start processing it. &quot; On October 22, 2000, the band played the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first live performance as a band. Vedder took the opportunity to thank the many people who had helped the band come together and make it to ten years. He noted that &quot;I would never do this accepting a Grammy or something. &quot; After concluding the Binaural Tour, the band released Touring Band 2000 the following year. The DVD featured select performances from the North American legs of the tour. Following the events of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Vedder and McCready were joined by Neil Young to perform the song &quot;Long Road&quot; from the Merkin Ball EP at the America: A Tribute to Heroes benefit concert. The concert, which aired on September 21, 2001, raised money for the victims and their families. Pearl Jam commenced work on a new album following a year-long break after its full-scale tour in support of Binaural. McCready described the recording environment as &quot;a pretty positive one&quot; and &quot;very intense and spiritual. &quot; Regarding the time period when the lyrics were being written, Vedder said, &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of mortality&#8230;It&#x27;s a weird time to be writing. Roskilde changed the shape of us as people, and our filter for seeing the world changed. &quot; Pearl Jam released its seventh album, Riot Act, on November 12, 2002. It included the singles &quot;I Am Mine&quot; and &quot;Save You&quot;. The album featured a much more folk-based and experimental sound, evident in the presence of B3 organist Boom Gaspar on songs such as &quot;Love Boat Captain&quot;. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said &quot;Riot Act is the album that Pearl Jam has been wanting to make since Vitalogy--a muscular art rock record, one that still hits hard but that is filled with ragged edges and odd detours. &quot; The track entitled &quot;Arc&quot; was recorded as a vocal tribute to the nine people who died at the Roskilde Festival in June 2000. Vedder only performed this song nine times on the 2003 tour, and the band left the track off all released bootlegs. In 2003, the band embarked on its Riot Act Tour, which included tours in Australia and North America. The band continued its official bootleg program, making every concert from the tour available in CD form through its official website. A total of six bootlegs were made available in record stores: Perth, Tokyo, State College, Pennsylvania, two shows from Madison Square Garden, and Mansfield, Massachusetts. At many shows during the 2003 North American tour, Vedder performed Riot Act&#x27;s &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot;, a commentary on President George W. Bush, with a rubber mask of Bush, wearing it at the beginning of the song and then hanging it on a mic stand to allow him to sing. The band made news when it was reported that several fans left after Vedder had &quot;impaled&quot; the Bush mask on his mic stand at the band&#x27;s Denver, Colorado show. In June 2003, Pearl Jam announced it was officially leaving Epic Records following the end of its contract with the label. The band stated it had &quot;no interest&quot; in signing with another label. The band&#x27;s first release without a label was the single for &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, in partnership with Amazon. com. Director Tim Burton approached Pearl Jam to request an original song for the soundtrack of his new film, Big Fish. After screening an early print of the film, Pearl Jam recorded the song for him. &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, which was later nominated for a Golden Globe Award, can be heard in the closing credits of Big Fish. The band released Lost Dogs, a two-disc collection of rarities and B-sides, and Live at the Garden, a DVD featuring the band&#x27;s July 8, 2003 concert at Madison Square Garden through Epic Records in November 2003. In 2004, Pearl Jam released the live album, Live at Benaroya Hall, through a one-album deal with BMG. 2004 marked the first time that Pearl Jam licensed a song for usage in a television show; a snippet of the song &quot;Yellow Ledbetter&quot; was used in the final episode of the television series Friends. Later that year, Epic released rearviewmirror (Greatest Hits 1991-2003), a Pearl Jam greatest hits collection spanning 1991 to 2003. This release marked the end of Pearl Jam&#x27;s contractual agreement with Epic Records. Pearl Jam played a show at Easy Street Records in Seattle in April 2005; recordings from the show were compiled for the Live at Easy Street album and released exclusively to independent record stores in June 2006. The band embarked on a Canadian cross-country tour in September 2005, kicking off the tour with a fundraising concert in Missoula, Montana for Democratic politician Jon Tester, then playing the Gorge Amphitheater before crossing into Canada. After touring Canada, Pearl Jam proceeded to open a Rolling Stones concert in Pittsburgh, then played two shows at the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey, before closing the tour with a concert in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The official bootlegs for the band&#x27;s 2005 shows were distributed via Pearl Jam&#x27;s official website in MP3 form. Pearl Jam also played a benefit concert to raise money for Hurricane Katrina relief on October 5, 2005, at the House of Blues in Chicago, Illinois. On November 22, 2005, Pearl Jam began its first Latin American tour. The work for Pearl Jam&#x27;s follow-up to Riot Act began after its appearance on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. The time period between the two albums was the longest gap between Pearl Jam&#x27;s studio albums to date and the new album was its first release for a new label. Clive Davis announced in February 2006 that Pearl Jam had signed with his label, J Records, which like Epic, is part of Sony Music Entertainment (then known as Sony BMG), though J has since folded into RCA Records. The band&#x27;s eighth studio album, Pearl Jam, was released on May 2, 2006. A number of critics cited Pearl Jam as a return to the band&#x27;s early sound, and McCready compared the new material to Vs. in a 2005 interview. Ament said, &quot;The band playing in a room--that came across. There's a kind of immediacy to the record, and that's what we were going for. &quot; Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly said that &quot;in a world full of boys sent to do a man&#x27;s job of rocking, Pearl Jam can still pull off gravitas. &quot; Current socio-political issues in the United States are addressed on the album. &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot;, a song criticizing the Iraq War and U. S. foreign policy, was released as a single and topped the Billboard Modern Rock chart; it was Pearl Jam&#x27;s first number one on that chart since &quot;Who You Are&quot; in 1996, and first number one on any chart in the United States since 1998 when &quot;Given to Fly&quot; reached number one on the Mainstream Rock chart. Pearl Jam also included the singles &quot;Life Wasted&quot; and &quot;Gone&quot;. To support Pearl Jam, the band embarked on its 2006 world tour. It toured North America, Australia and notably Europe; Pearl Jam had not toured the continent for six years. The North American tour included three two-night stands opening for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The band served as the headliners for the Leeds and Reading festivals, despite having vowed to never play at a festival again after Roskilde. Vedder started both concerts with an emotional plea to the crowd to look after each other. He commented during the Leeds set that the band&#x27;s decision to play a festival for the first time after Roskilde had nothing to do with &quot;guts&quot; but with trust in the audience. In 2007, Pearl Jam recorded a cover of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Love, Reign o&#x27;er Me&quot; for the Mike Binder film, Reign Over Me; it was later made available as a music download on the iTunes Music Store. The band embarked on a 13-date European tour, and headlined Lollapalooza in Grant Park, on August 5, 2007. The band released a CD box set in June 2007, entitled Live at the Gorge 05/06, that documents its shows at The Gorge Amphitheatre, and in September 2007 a concert DVD, entitled Immagine in Cornice, which documents the band&#x27;s Italian shows from its 2006 tour was released. In June 2008, Pearl Jam performed as the headline act at the Bonnaroo Music Festival. The Bonnaroo appearance took place amidst a twelve-date tour in the Eastern United States. In July 2008, the band performed at the VH1 tribute to The Who alongside Foo Fighters, Incubus and The Flaming Lips. In the days prior to Election Day 2008, Pearl Jam digitally released through its official website a free documentary film, entitled Vote for Change? 2004, which follows the band&#x27;s time spent on the 2004 Vote for Change tour. In March 2009, Ten was reissued in four editions, featuring such extras as a remastering and remix of the entire album by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, a DVD of the band&#x27;s 1992 appearance on MTV Unplugged, and an LP of its September 20, 1992 concert at Magnuson Park in Seattle. It was the first reissue in a planned re-release of Pearl Jam&#x27;s entire catalog that led up to the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2011. A Pearl Jam retrospective film directed by Cameron Crowe titled Pearl Jam Twenty was also planned to coincide with the anniversary. In 2011, Vs. and Vitalogy were reissued in the spring time in deluxe form. Pearl Jam began work for the follow-up to Pearl Jam in early 2008. In 2009, the band began to build on instrumental and demo tracks written during 2008. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, Backspacer, its first to be produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien since Yield. Backspacer debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard music charts, the band&#x27;s first album to do so since No Code in 1996 and has sold 635,000 copies as of July 2013, according to Nielsen SoundScan. The music on the record features a sound influenced by pop and New Wave. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that &quot;prior to Backspacer, Pearl Jam wouldn&#x27;t or couldn&#x27;t have made music this unfettered, unapologetically assured, casual, and, yes, fun. &quot; Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, &quot;I&#x27;ve tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that&#x27;s going to be easier now. &quot; &quot;The Fixer&quot; was chosen as the album&#x27;s first single. Pearl Jam did not re-sign its record deal with J Records, and the band released the album through its own label Monkeywrench Records in the United States and through Universal Music Group internationally. Pearl Jam reached a deal with Target to be the exclusive big-box store retailer for the album in the United States. The album also saw release through the band&#x27;s official website, independent record stores, online retailers, and iTunes. In an interview McCready revealed that Pearl Jam may finish the Backspacer outtakes in the next six months, and told San Diego radio station KBZT that the band may release an EP in 2010 consisting of those songs, while Vedder instead suggested that the songs may be used for the band&#x27;s next studio album. In August 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Virgin Festival, the Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival, and played five shows in Europe and three in North America. In October 2009, Pearl Jam headlined the Austin City Limits Music Festival. Later in October on Halloween night, the band played in what was the last performance at the Philadelphia Spectrum. An additional leg consisting of a tour of Oceania took place afterwards. In May 2010, the band embarked on a month long tour starting with the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival. The tour headed to the East Coast and ended May 21, 2010 at Madison Square Garden in New York. A European tour took place in June and July 2010, where the band performed in Northern Ireland for the first time at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast. In late October 2010, Pearl Jam performed at the 24th Annual Bridge School Benefit Concert at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. A live album, titled Live on Ten Legs, was released on January 17, 2011. It is compilation of live tracks from their 2003 to 2010 world tours, and is a follow-up to Live on Two Legs, which consisted of songs recorded during their 1998 North American tour. In March 2011, bassist Jeff Ament told Billboard that the band has 25 songs and they&#x27;d be heading into the studio in April to begin recording the follow-up to Backspacer. On May 16, 2011, the band confirmed that they would play the Labor Day weekend at the Alpine Valley Music Theatre, East Troy, Wisconsin, followed by ten shows in Canada. On September 8, 2011, the band released a new song titled &quot;Ole&quot;. On November 18, the band released Toronto 9. 11. 11--a free live album available through the launch of Google Music. On November 21, 2011, as part of their PJ20 World Tour, Pearl Jam visited Costa Rica for the first time to a 30,000 crowd of fans at the New National Stadium. The following month, the band announced a tour of Europe, which started in June 2012. On July 11, 2013, the band announced that their tenth studio album Lightning Bolt would be released internationally on October 14, 2013 and on the next day in the United States, along with releasing the first single &quot;Mind Your Manners&quot;. The band is scheduled to play a two-leg tour in North America during October and November, followed by headlining the Big Day Out festival in Australia and New Zealand in 2014. The second single, &quot;Sirens&quot;, was released on September 18, 2013. After selling 166,000 copies in its first week, Lightning Bolt became Pearl Jam&#x27;s fifth album to reach number one on the Billboard 200. Compared with the other grunge bands of the early 1990s, Pearl Jam's style is noticeably less heavy and harkens back to the classic rock music of the 1970s. Pearl Jam has cited many punk rock and classic rock bands as influences, including The Who, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, Kiss and the Ramones. Pearl Jam's success has been attributed to its sound, which fuses &quot;the riff-heavy stadium rock of the &#x27;70s with the grit and anger of &#x27;80s post-punk, without ever neglecting hooks and choruses. &quot; Gossard&#x27;s rhythm guitar style is known for its sense of beat and groove, while McCready&#x27;s lead guitar style, influenced by artists such as Jimi Hendrix, has been described as &quot;feel-oriented&quot; and &quot;rootsy. &quot; Pearl Jam has broadened its musical range with subsequent releases. As he had more influence on the band&#x27;s sound, Vedder sought to make the band&#x27;s musical output less catchy. He said, &quot;I felt that with more popularity, we were going to be crushed, our heads were going to pop like grapes. &quot; By 1994's Vitalogy, the band began to incorporate more punk influences into its music. The band's 1996 album, No Code, was a deliberate break from the musical style of Ten. The songs on the album featured elements of garage rock, worldbeat, and experimentalism. After 1998's Yield, which was somewhat of a return to the straightforward rock approach of the band&#x27;s early work, the band dabbled with experimental art rock on 2000's Binaural and folk rock elements on 2002's Riot Act. The band's 2006 album, Pearl Jam, was cited as a return to the band's early sound. The band&#x27;s 2009 album, Backspacer, contains elements of pop and New Wave. Critic Jim DeRogatis describes Vedder&#x27;s vocals as a &quot;Jim Morrison-like vocal growl. &quot; Greg Prato of Allmusic said, &quot;With his hard-hitting and often confessional lyrical style and Jim Morrison-esque baritone, Vedder also became one of the most copied lead singers in all of rock. &quot; Vedder&#x27;s lyrical topics range from personal (&quot;Alive&quot;, &quot;Better Man&quot;) to social and political concerns (&quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot;). His lyrics have often invoked the use of storytelling and have included themes of freedom, individualism, and sympathy for troubled individuals. When the band started, Gossard and McCready were clearly designated as rhythm and lead guitarists, respectively. The dynamic began to change when Vedder started to play more rhythm guitar during the Vitalogy era. McCready said in 2006, &quot;Even though there are three guitars, I think there&#x27;s maybe more room now. Stone will pull back and play a two-note line and Ed will do a power chord thing, and I fit into all that. &quot; While Nirvana had brought grunge to the mainstream in the early 1990s, Pearl Jam quickly outsold them, and became &quot;the most popular American rock &amp; roll band of the &#x27;90s&quot; according to Allmusic. Pearl Jam has been described as &quot;modern rock radio&#x27;s most influential stylists - the workmanlike midtempo chug of songs like &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Even Flow&quot; just melodic enough to get moshers singing along. &quot; The band inspired and influenced a number of bands, ranging from Silverchair to Puddle of Mudd and The Strokes. The band have also been credited for inspiring the indie rock scene of 90s-era urban Pakistan, that has since evolved into a rich rock music culture in the country. Pearl Jam has been praised for its rejection of rock star excess and its insistence on backing causes it believes in. Music critic Jim DeRogatis said in the aftermath of the band&#x27;s battle with Ticketmaster that it &quot;proved that a rock band which isn&#x27;t comprised of greed heads can play stadiums and not milk the audience for every last dime&#8230; it indicated that idealism in rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is not the sole province of those &#x27;60s bands enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. &quot; Eric Weisbard of Spin said in 2001, &quot;The group that was once accused of being synthetic grunge now seem as organic and principled a rock band as exists. &quot; In a 2005 USA Today reader&#x27;s poll, Pearl Jam was voted the greatest American rock band of all time. In April 2006, Pearl Jam was awarded the prize for &quot;Best Live Act&quot; in Esquire&#x27;s Esky Music Awards. The blurb called Pearl Jam &quot;the rare superstars who still play as though each show could be their last. &quot; Pearl Jam&#x27;s fanbase following has been compared to that of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s, with Rolling Stone magazine stating that Pearl Jam &quot;toured incessantly and became one of rock&#x27;s great arena acts, attracting a fanatical, Grateful Dead-like cult following with marathon, true-believer shows in the vanishing spirit of Bruce Springsteen, the Who and U2. &quot; When asked about Pearl Jam&#x27;s legacy in a 2000 interview, Vedder said, &quot;I think at some point along the way we began feeling we wanted to give people something to believe in because we all had bands that gave that to us when we needed something to believe in. That was the big challenge for us after the first record and the response to it. The goal immediately became how do we continue to be musicians and grow and survive in view of all this&#8230; The answers weren't always easy, but I think we found a way. &quot; Throughout its career, Pearl Jam has promoted wider social and political issues, from pro-choice sentiments to opposition to George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency. Vedder acts as the band&#x27;s spokesman on these issues. The band has promoted an array of causes, including awareness of Crohn&#x27;s disease, which Mike McCready suffers from, Ticketmaster venue monopolization and the environment and wildlife protection, among others. Guitarist Stone Gossard has been active in environmental pursuits, and has been an advocate of Pearl Jam&#x27;s carbon neutral policy, offsetting the band&#x27;s environmental impact. Vedder has advocated for the release of the West Memphis 3 for years and Damien Echols, a member of the three, shares a writing credit for the song &quot;Army Reserve&quot; (from Pearl Jam). The band, and especially frontman Eddie Vedder, have been vocal supporters of the pro-choice movement. In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled &quot;Reclamation&quot;, which detailed his views on abortion. In an MTV Unplugged concert the same year, Vedder stood on a stool and wrote &quot;PRO-CHOICE!&quot; on his arm in protest when the band performed the song &quot;Porch&quot;. The band are members of a number of pro-choice organizations, including Choice USA and Voters for Choice. As members of Rock the Vote and Vote for Change, the band has encouraged voter registration and participation in United States elections. Vedder was outspoken in support of Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2000, and Pearl Jam played a series of concerts on the Vote for Change tour in October 2004, supporting the candidacy of John Kerry for U. S. President. In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour&#x27;s performers, Vedder told the magazine, &quot;I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it&#x27;s a time of crisis. We have to get a new administration in. &quot; Vedder sometimes comments on politics between songs, often to criticize U. S. foreign policy, and a number of his songs, including &quot;Bu$hleaguer&quot; and &quot;World Wide Suicide&quot;, are openly critical of the Bush administration. At Lollapalooza 2007, Vedder spoke out against BP Amoco dumping effluent in Lake Michigan, and at the end of &quot;Daughter&quot;, he sang the lyrics &quot;George Bush leave this world alone/George Bush find yourself another home&quot;. In the beginning of the second encore Vedder invited Iraq war veteran Tomas Young, the subject of the documentary Body of War, onto the stage to urge an end to the war. Young in turn introduced Ben Harper, who contributed vocals to &quot;No More&quot; and &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World&quot;. The band has since discovered that some of the Bush-related lyrics were excised from the AT&amp;T webcast of the event, and are questioning whether that constitutes censorship. AT&amp;T later apologized and blamed the censorship on contractor Davie Brown Entertainment. Pearl Jam has performed numerous benefit concerts in aid of charities. For example, the band headlined a Seattle concert in 2001 to support the United Nations&#x27; efforts to combat world hunger. The band added a date at the Chicago House of Blues to its 2005 tour to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina; the concert proceeds were donated to Habitat for Humanity, the American Red Cross and the Jazz Foundation of America. In 2011, Pearl Jam was named 2011 Planet Defenders by Rock The Earth for their environmental activism and their large-scale efforts to decrease their own carbon emissions", "Megadeth": "Megadeth is an American thrash metal band led by founder, frontman, guitarist, and songwriter Dave Mustaine. Formed in 1983 Los Angeles, California with bass player Dave Ellefson following Mustaine&#x27;s departure from Metallica, the band has since released fourteen studio albums, three live albums, five compilation albums, two extended plays, thirty-four singles, eight video albums, and thirty-two music videos. As a pioneer of the American thrash metal movement, Megadeth rose to international fame in the 1980s, but experienced numerous line-up changes, due partly to the band&#x27;s notorious substance abuse problems. After finding sobriety and securing a stable line-up, Megadeth went on to release a string of platinum and gold albums, including the platinum-selling landmark Rust in Peace in 1990 and the Grammy nominated, multi-platinum Countdown to Extinction in 1992. Megadeth disbanded in 2002 after Mustaine suffered a severe nerve injury to his left arm, but following extensive physical therapy, Mustaine reformed the band in 2004 and released The System Has Failed , followed by United Abominations in 2007; the albums deputed on the Billboard Top 200 chart at #18 and #8, respectively. Megadeth is known for a distinctive guitar style, often involving complex, intricate musical passages, and trade off guitar solos. Mustaine is also known for his original &quot;snarling&quot; vocal style, as well as his recurring lyrical themes, often involving politics, war, addiction, and personal relationships. As one of the most commercially successful heavy metal bands of all time, Megadeth has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide, including six consecutive platinum albums, with seven consecutive Grammy nominations for Best Metal Performance. In the band&#x27;s 23 active years, Megadeth has had 20 official members, with Dave Mustaine remaining as the driving force, main songwriter, and sole original member following the end his musical partnership with Dave Ellefson in 2002. Megadeth is hailed as one of the bands among the &quot;Big Four of Thrash,&quot; along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax, who were responsible for creating and popularizing the genre in the 1980s. Just two months after Dave Mustaine was fired from Metallica in 1983, guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine formed the thrash metal quartet Megadeth. Though Megadeth followed the basic blueprint of Metallica&#x27;s relentless attack, Mustaine&#x27;s group distinguished themselves from his earlier band by adding an emphasis on instrumental skills, speeding the tempo up slightly, and making the instrumental attack harsher. By streamlining the classic thrash metal approach and making the music more threatening, as well as making the lyrics more nihilistic, Megadeth became one of the leading bands of the genre during the mid-&#x27;80s and late &#x27;80s. Each album they released went at least gold, and they continually sold out arenas across America, in addition to developing a strong following overseas. By the early &#x27;90s, they had toned their music down slightly, yet that simply increased their following; all of their proper &#x27;90s albums debuted in the Top Ten. Throughout Megadeth&#x27;s many lineup changes, the two core members were bassist Dave Ellefson and guitarist/vocalist Dave Mustaine (born September 13, 1961), who was the band&#x27;s official leader. Mustaine grew up in the suburbs of Southern California, where he was raised by his mother in a broken home; frequently, his mother left him to be raised by aunts and uncles, who never encouraged his musical inclinations and often belittled him for his fondness for heavy metal. In 1981, he formed Metallica with James Hetfield and Lars Ulrich. Mustaine spent two years with Metallica, developing a strong cult following in California&#x27;s underground metal scene, before he was kicked out of the group in 1983, allegedly over his substance abuse. For the next few years, Megadeth toured and gained a following, signing with the independent label Combat in late 1984. The following year, the group released their debut, Killing Is My Business&#8230;And Business Is Good!, which received strong reviews, not only in metal-oriented publications, but also in mainstream music magazines. The album sold very well for an independent release, which attracted the attention of major record labels. By the end of the year, the group had signed with Capitol. Megadeth&#x27;s first major-label album, Peace Sells&#8230;But Who&#x27;s Buying?, was released in the fall of 1986. Like its predecessor, Peace Sells was greeted by strong reviews and sales; it eventually went platinum. In January 1988 Megadeth released So Far, So Good&#8230; So What!, and while the album was eventually certified platinum in the United States, it was initially panned by critics, with Allmusic complaining that the album &quot;lacked conceptual unity and musical bite&quot;, and that it &quot;wants to sound threatening but mostly comes off as forced and somewhat juvenile&quot;. So Far, So Good&#8230; featured the single &quot;In My Darkest Hour&quot;, with music written by Mustaine as a tribute to fallen Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. The song remains a fan favorite, and has been performed at nearly every Megadeth show since. So Far, So Good&#8230; also featured a cover version of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Anarchy in the UK&quot;, with lyrics altered by Mustaine (who later admitted to hearing them wrong). In the years immediately following the release of So Far, So Good&#8230;So What!, Mustaine fired Jeff Young and Chuck Behler replacing them with guitarist Marty Friedman and drummer Nick Menza. This lineup recorded Megadeth&#x27;s fourth and most progressive album, Rust in Peace. The record peaked at number 23 on the American charts and went platinum. 1991 saw Metallica break through to the mainstream, and sensing the possibility for similar success, Mustaine followed suit in stripping down the band&#x27;s sound, though it remained as technically perfectionistic as Rust in Peace. The result, Countdown to Extinction, was released in 1992, entering the charts at number two; the record went double platinum and became the band&#x27;s biggest hit, confirming that they had retained their audience in the wake of grunge. Now one of the most popular metal bands in the world, Megadeth moved further toward the mainstream with Youthanasia in 1994, which entered the charts at number four and, like its predecessor, went platinum. The following year, the group released Hidden Treasures, a rarities collection that featured some of the soundtrack tunes that had helped expand the group&#x27;s MTV audience in the early &#x27;90s. 1997&#x27;s Cryptic Writings found Megadeth fully embraced by album rock radio, which formerly would never have touched the band. Ex-Suicidal Tendencies drummer Jimmy DeGrasso signed on in 1998, in time for the following year&#x27;s Risk. In 200f0, following the release of the best-of Capitol Punishment, Marty Friedman followed Nick Menza out the door; he was replaced by former Savatage and Alice Cooper guitarist Al Pitrelli. After signing with the BMG subsidiary Sanctuary, Megadeth debuted its new lineup on 2001&#x27;s The World Needs a Hero. While on break from touring, Mustaine suffered a serious injury in January 2002 while staying in Texas. He was diagnosed with having radial neuropathy shortly thereafter, a condition that prevented him from playing guitar. The compressed radial nerves in his left arm and hand were strained, leaving Megadeth little recourse but to disband in April 2002, after almost 20 years in the music industry. During his time off, Mustaine prepared an elaborate reissue campaign, remastering each album and reissuing them all with bonus material. This campaign set the stage for a Megadeth revival, which came in 2004-2005 with a surprising comeback album, The System Has Failed, and some heavy touring. Capitol released a new best-of, simply titled Greatest Hits, just as Megadeth hit the summer concert circuit, headlining Mustaine&#x27;s own Gigantour festival. In 2007 Megadeth released the politically charged United Abominations. As of May 19, Megadeth had finished recording the album and on June 18, the album title was revealed to be Endgame. On May 27, 2009, Dave Mustaine confirmed all 12 songs are complete and they are currently mixing and mastering the record. As mentioned by Dave Mustaine on the syndicated radio show Infowars, the name of the album Endgame is an homage to the Alex Jones documentary of the same name. The release date for the &quot;Endgame&quot; album was announced on the Megadeth official website as September 15, 2009, and Metal Hammer magazine&#x27;s website were the first to review the album track by track. Megadeth began its Endgame tour on November 14, in Grand Rapids, Michigan and ended on December 13, in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Tour featured Machine Head, Suicide Silence, Warbringer, and Arcanium. In January 2010, Megadeth was set to embark on the &quot;American Carnage&quot; tour with Slayer and Testament, both giants of the thrash and heavy metal scene. The tour was scheduled to begin on January 18, but was ultimately postponed until later in the summer due to Tom Araya&#x27;s back surgery. Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Head Crusher&quot; was nominated for a 2010 Grammy. Megadeth also announced a &quot;Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour&quot;, which began on March 1 as a month-long North American tour with support from Testament and Exodus. During the tour, Megadeth played Rust In Peace in its entirety and Testament played The Legacy in its entirety. As of February 8, 2010, and prior to the start of the &quot;Rust in Peace 20th Anniversary Tour&quot;, original bassist Dave Ellefson rejoined Megadeth after eight years. He stated in an interview for Classic Rock magazine that Megadeth drummer Shawn Drover contacted him and had said that bassist James Lomenzo was declining and had told him that &quot;if ever there was a time for you and Dave to talk, now is it. &quot; In recent news, Megadeth have been working on a new song entitled &quot;Sudden Death&quot; and to which Mustaine claims &quot;won&#x27;t be ready for a half a year at best. &quot; However, it is due to appear in the video game Guitar Hero 6 this fall. On June 18th IGN posted a video showcasing the completed version of the song on the game. Megadeth are also due to release a &#x27;Rust In Peace&#x27; Live DVD, recorded at the Hollywood Palladium, the set will be released on September 7th. Megadeth, along with Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax performed on the same bill for the first time on June 16, 2010 at Bemowo Airport (Warsaw, Poland). It was the first performance of that bands played as a part of Sonisphere Festival series, one of the following (Sofia, Bulgaria, June 22, 2010) was sent via satellite in HD to cinemas. They also went on to play in Athens, Greece (June 24, 2010), Bucharest, Romania (June 26, 2010) and then in Istanbul, Turkey (June 27, 2010) also as part of the Sonisphere Festival. On September 24, 2010, Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax began The Jagermeister Music Tour in Dallas, TX. Megadeth continued to play their 1990 album Rust In Peace in its entirety, while Slayer performed their Seasons in the Abyss album. On October 21, 2010, during the final show of Jagermeister Music Tour, Kerry King joined Megadeth on stage at the Gibson Amphitheater in Hollywood, California to perform Megadeth&#x27;s classic &quot;Rattlehead&quot;. This was the first time in 26 years that Kerry King had shared the stage with Megadeth since he played with the band during Megadeth&#x27;s very first shows in 1984. In an October 2010 interview with Crypt Magazine, Shawn Drover stated plans on another Megadeth album: &quot;Yeah, we're certainly talking about it. Right now we're in tour mode, but we're starting to discuss our game plan for next year, and I envision next year we'll be recording a new record. &quot; Later that month, Roadrunner Records submitted several Megadeth songs for Grammy nominations. They submitted &quot;Sudden Death&quot; for Best Metal Performance, &quot;The Right to Go Insane&quot; for Best Hard Rock Performance, and &quot;Rust in Peace Live&quot; for Best Rock Album at the 53rd Grammy Awards. &quot;Sudden Death&quot; was nominated, making it the band&#x27;s ninth Grammy nominated song. On December 18, 2010, it was announced that Megadeth and Slayer would join forces once again for the European Carnage Tour in March and April 2011. Megadeth was also confirmed for the fourth annual Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival in July and August 2011. On January 25, 2011, another Big 4 show was announced, this time in the United States. The gig took place on April 23, 2011 in Indio, CA at the Empire Polo Club. At the time, this was the only scheduled stop in the US and was the first time all of the Big 4 members played on the same stage there. Shortly after the show, a second American show, to be held at at Yankee Stadium in New York, was announced. During an online chat with members of the band&#x27;s fan club, Mustaine revealed that the band had completed five new songs for the next album. Mustaine also noted that the new album was turning out to be &quot;more like Endgame&quot;. In an online post during the Thirteen&#x27;s recording, Shawn Drover noted that working with producer Johnny K (Staind, Sevendust) was a &quot;blast&quot; and that he &quot;shared the same vision for the new album&quot;. In an interview with Pure Grain Audio, Mustaine said that the album would sound quite different from previous offerings, claiming that it was &quot;different, a hundred percent different&quot;, and calling the sound &quot;really super-modern&quot;. Mustaine went on to state that he believes that it will be the band&#x27;s best album since Countdown to Extinction. On June 3, 2011, it was announced that a new song, &quot;Never Dead&quot;, was to be included in a trailer for the video game NeverDead. On July 4, 2011, in Hamburg, Megadeth debuted a new song entitled &quot;Public Enemy No. 1&quot;. Public Enemy No. 1 was made available as a free single November 1, 2011, exclusively on iTunes. Mustaine announced on July 8, 2011 that the new album would be entitled Thirteen, though it would be stylized as &quot;TH1RT3EN&quot; on the album cover. He also confirmed in an interview with Rolling Stone on July 12, 2011 that &quot;Sudden Death&quot; (which earlier appeared in the video game Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock), &quot;Never Dead&quot; and a title track, &quot;13&quot;, would be included on the album. In an interview KISW 99. 9 FM in Seattle, Mustaine stated that, after 4 years of absence, there would be a new Gigantour tour in 2012. In October 2011 it was announced that Motorhead, Volbeat and Lacuna Coil will feature alongside Megadeth for the next Gigantour. In February 2012 Rob Zombie and Megadeth announced nine-date co-headlining U. S. tour scheduled for May 2012. On September 11, 2012, it was announced that the band would re-release the Countdown to Extinction album for its 20th anniversary. Also announced was the band&#x27;s 2012 fall tour in which the band would perform the album live in its entirety, similar to 2010&#x27;s Rust in Peace anniversary tour. Additionally, in December 2012, another track from Thirteen, &quot;Whose Life (Is It Anyways?)&quot;, was nominated for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance at the 55th Grammy Awards, but ultimately lost to Halestorm&#x27;s &quot;Love Bites (So Do I)&quot;. The band revealed on August 22, 2012, that they would be returning to the studio with producer Johnny K to record their fourteenth album. By December 2012, three new songs were &quot;tracked and almost done&quot;. In 2013, Megadeth parted ways with Roadrunner Records for Mustaine&#x27;s label, Tradecraft, distributed through Universal Music Group. Their fourteenth album, &quot;Super Collider&quot; was released on June 4 and debuted at number six on the Billboard 200, making &quot;Super Collider&quot; the band&#x27;s highest charting album since 1994&#x27;s &quot;Youthanasia&quot;. Mustaine revealed that he is already thinking about a new Megadeth album, although &quot;Super Collider&quot; was released just 2 months prior. Mustaine says that the death of Slayer guitarist Jeff Hanneman gave him a sense of mortality, explaining: &quot;We&#x27;re planning our next time to go into the studio to start demoing up our next record,&quot; and &quot;You know, time is short. Nobody knows how long they&#x27;re gonna live. You see what happened with Jeff Hanneman, so I wanna write as much as I can while I can. &quot; In August 2013 the band announced a new live release, &quot;Countdown to Extinction: Live&quot;, recorded at the Fox Theater in Pomona, CA in December 2012.

The group played under several names, including Talkhouse, Drive Like I Do, Bigsleep, and The Slowdown before settling on The 1975 in 2012. The band consists of Matthew Healy (vocals, guitar), Adam Hann (guitar), Ross MacDonald (bass), and George Daniel (drums). The group released their debut album, &quot;The 1975&quot; on 2 September 2013. The band has also released five EPs: &quot;Facedown&quot; (2012), &quot;Sex&quot; (2012), &quot;Music for Cars&quot; (2013), &quot;IV&quot; (2013), and a US version of &quot;IV&quot; with a significantly altered track listing (2013). ", "The Clientele": "The Clientele are a London-based band with Alasdair MacLean on vocals and guitar, Mark Keen on drums, James Hornsey on bass and Mel Draisey on Keys and Violin. MacLean and Hornsey began collaborating musically while still in school, after MacLean saw that Hornsey had written the name of the band Felt on his pencil case. The band formed in 1991, with the current lineup along with Innes Phillips, who shared singing and songwriting duties with MacLean. The band recorded an album&#x27;s worth of material but failed to get any label interest. Innes left the band (and would go on to found The Relict); the rest of the group re-formed in 1997, and they released a number of singles that were eventually collected on Suburban Light (2000). The Violet Hour (2003) was their first album proper, which again saw great acclaim, but, as yet, little commercial success. August 2005 saw the release of their second full album, Strange Geometry. Draisey joined the band in 2006 just in time for band&#x27;s second tour of the States. The band is more successful in America, where they are signed to Merge Records, home of bands such as Lambchop and Spoon, than in their native Britain. Their music is noted for its reverb-rich production and MacLean&#x27;s distinctive breathy vocals and jangly guitar playing. Their lyrics take a strong inspiration from surrealist literature and art from the early 20th century. &quot;We Could Walk Together&quot; quotes a line (&quot;like a silver ring thrown into the flood of my heart&quot;) from a 1928 poem by French surrealist Joe Bousquet; the song &quot;What Goes Up&quot; quotes the poem &quot;Stupidity Street&quot; by Ralph Hodgson in its entirety. The song &quot;I Can&#x27;t Seem To Make You Mine&quot; from their album &quot;Strange Geometry&quot; is used in the movie &quot;The Lake House&quot; (2006). Their album &#x27;God Save The Clientele&#x27; was released on May 8th 2007. &#x27;Bonfires on the Heath&#x27; followed in 2009, and &#x27;Minotaur&#x27; in 2010. http://www. theclientele. co. uk/", "Modest Mouse": "Modest Mouse is an alternative rock band which formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington, United States. The band&#x27;s original lineup consisted of guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy. Since being signed to Sony&#x27;s Epic Records in 2000, Modest Mouse has attained significant popular success with songs such as &quot;Float On&quot; and &quot;Dashboard. &quot; The band&#x27;s current configuration is Isaac Brock (vocals, guitar), Tom Peloso (strings, horns, bass, keyboards), Jim Fairchild (guitar), Eric Judy (bass), Jeremiah Green (drums) and Joe Plummer (drums). Plummer has recently become the new drummer for The Shins. Brock came up with the name &quot;Modest Mouse&quot; when he read the Virginia Woolf stream of consciousness essay The Mark On the Wall in which the author described the working middle class as &quot;modest mouse-coloured people&quot; Brock frequently moved around with his mother when he was a child. Around this time, his mother left his father for his father&#x27;s brother (Brock&#x27;s uncle). Brock&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house flooded and forced them to move into his mother&#x27;s new husband&#x27;s trailer, but there was no room for Brock. Brock stayed behind, living in the second story of the flooded house, until he was eventually evicted by police. He then moved into a shed next to his mother&#x27;s house and it is said this is where Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy first began playing music. In 1994, the band recorded their debut EP, Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect? , at Calvin Johnson&#x27;s Dub Narcotic Studios, which was then released on Calvin&#x27;s record label K Records . Then followed a single with Sub Pop that was recorded by producer Steve Wold at Moon Studios. Wold, who in the mid-2000&#x27;s would begin to perform under the name Seasick Steve, would also perform on the band&#x27;s albums, but was never an official member of the band. After moving to Up Records Modest Mouse put out several releases recorded at Moon Studios, including 1996&#x27;s This Is A Long Drive For Someone With Nothing To Think About . This double LP was produced and recorded by Steve Wold. The next offering on UP was Interstate 8 ; also produced by Steve Wold. 1997&#x27;s The Lonesome Crowded West , (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) turned out to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough album. The Lonesome Crowded West gained the band a cult following and is now widely considered by many critics to be one of the defining albums of mid-90s indie rock. In 2000, Modest Mouse released The Moon And Antarctica , their first album on a major label ( Epic Records ). The band enjoyed some success on alternative radio with the singles &quot;3rd Planet&quot; and &quot;Gravity Rides Everything. &quot; Lead singer Isaac Brock has since put out an album with his side project Ugly Casanova on Sub Pop Records. In 2003, drummer Jeremiah Green quit the band; the official word was that he was quitting to work with his side project, Vells. He was replaced with two members, drummer Benjamin Weikel (who also drummed for The Helio Sequence) and guitarist Dann Gallucci (Murder City Devils). Weikel being new to the band and Gallucci returning to the band for the first time since This is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About. On April 6, 2004, Modest Mouse released the platinum-selling Good News For People Who Love Bad News , which scored two hits with &quot;Float On&quot; and &quot;Ocean Breathes Salty&quot;. In 2004 Jeremiah Green returned to the band, and Benjamin Weikel now drums exclusively for The Helio Sequence. Dann Gallucci left the band in August, and they toured with Hutch Harris of The Thermals during the fall of 2004. Modest Mouse was mentioned by name in the 2005 Supreme Court decision in the case of MGM v. Grokster. Justice Souter wrote that on the Grokster P2P network, &quot;Users seeking Top 40 songs, for example, or the latest release by Modest Mouse, are certain to be far more numerous than those seeking a free Decameron, and Grokster and StreamCast translated that demand into dollars. &quot; In 2005, multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, who already played various instruments on Good News For People Who Love Bad News, officially joined the band. In 2006, Johnny Marr, former guitarist for The Smiths, became an official member of the band. On March 20, 2007, the band released their fifth album, We Were Dead Before The Ship Even Sank . Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Dashboard&quot;, &quot;Missed the Boat&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Everything&quot; and &quot;Little Motel&quot;. The album debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart. James Mercer of The Shins provides backing vocals on three songs. In 2009, they released No One&#x27;s First And You&#x27;re Next, an EP of unreleased songs from around the time Good News and We Were Dead were recorded, and two songs that had already been released, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got It All (Most)&quot; and &quot;King Rat&quot;. The video for King Rat was directed by late actor Heath Ledger. In 2009, Johnny Marr left the band and was replaced by Jim Fairchild, formerly of Grandaddy. The band performed at several festivals throughout 2009 and 2010, including the main stage of the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010. The band is currently recording their sixth album. ", "John Williams": "There are at least five artists with this name: (1) John Towner Williams (film score composer) (2) John Christopher Williams (classical guitarist) (3) John Williams (Irish musician) (4) John Williams (blues/jazz guitarist) (5) John Knowles Williams (experimental/indie) &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (1) John Towner Williams (born February 8, 1932) is one of the most widely recognized composers of film scores. As of 2013, he has received 48 music-related Academy Award nominations, an accomplishment surpassed by none. Early scores and compositions are credited as Johnny Williams. Williams is best known for heroic, rousing themes in adventure and fantasy films. This includes some of the highest grossing films of all time, such as the Star Wars movies, the Superman movies, Jaws , E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial , Raiders of the Lost Ark , Jurassic Park , and the first three Harry Potter movies. His richly thematic and highly popular 1977 score to the first Star Wars film was selected by the American Film Institute as the greatest American movie score of all time. Five of his film scores won Oscars. His long career has also included many sensitive dramatic scores (such as Schindler&#x27;s List , Saving Private Ryan , and Munich ) and quirky character studies (like Catch Me If You Can , the theme for which makes extensive use of jazz, perhaps in homage to Mancini&#x27;s famous music for The Pink Panther ). Also noteworthy are his recent collaborations with Yo-Yo Ma and Itzhak Perlman on the score for Memoirs of a Geisha , as well as Williams&#x27; other more experimental concert works. Williams has composed the scores for every Steven Spielberg movie, with the exception of The Color Purple (scored by co-producer Quincy Jones) and Duel (Spielberg&#x27;s first feature film). While skilled in a variety of twentieth-century compositional idioms, his most familiar style may be described as a form of neo-romanticism, influenced by his predecessors and their use of large-scale orchestral music. Korngold (and other Hollywood Golden Age composers), is clearly evident in many of Williams&#x27; most famous works. Anyone who has watched the Olympics on television has heard Williams&#x27; &quot;Olympic Fanfare and Theme,&quot; parts of which (especially the last fifteen seconds of the fanfare) receive extensive playtime every four years. Williams also composed &quot;The Mission,&quot; the worldwide-known theme from NBC News. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (2) John Christopher Williams is a classical guitar player. Born in Melbourne, Australia, on 24 April 1941, to an English father (Len Williams) and an Australian-Chinese mother, Williams was taught initially by his father. At the age of twelve he went to Italy to study under &quot;The Maestro,&quot; Andres Segovia. Later, he attended the Royal College of Music in London, studying piano because the school did not have a guitar department at the time. Upon graduation, he was offered the opportunity to create such a department. He seized the opportunity and ran it for the first two years. Williams has maintained links with the College (and with the Northern College in Manchester) ever since. Williams is best known as a classical guitarist, but has explored many different musical traditions. He has collaborated with Julian Bream and Paco Pena and was a member of the fusion group Sky. He is also a composer and arranger. Williams has commissioned guitar concertos from composers such as Stephen Dodgson, Andre Previn, Patrick Gowers, Richard Harvey, and Steve Gray. He has also worked with composers from his native Australia, including Phillip Houghton, Peter Sculthorpe, Ross Edwards (composer), and Nigel Westlake, to produce guitar works that capture the spirit of his homeland. He enjoyed a worldwide hit single with his recording of Cavatina by Stanley Myers, used as the theme tune to the Oscar-winning film The Deer Hunter (1979). The piece had originally been written for piano, for another film ten years earlier, The Walking Stick (1970) but re-written for guitar and expanded by Myers at Williams&#x27; invitation. In 1973, Cleo Laine wrote lyrics and recorded the song &quot;He Was Beautiful&quot; accompanied by John Williams. A year later, it was a top-five UK hit single for Iris Williams (no relation). At the invitation of producer Martin Lewis he created a highly acclaimed classical-rock fusion duet with celebrated rock guitarist Pete Townshend of Townshend&#x27;s anthemic &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot; for the 1979 Amnesty International benefit show The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball. The duet was featured on the resulting album and the film version of the show - bringing Williams to the broader attention of the rock audience. The relationship with Lewis led to Williams&#x27; classical-rock fusion band Sky being invited to give the first-ever rock concert to be held at Westminster Abbey - a benefit concert for Amnesty that Lewis produced in February 1981. He is visiting professor at the Royal Academy of Music, London. Williams and his artist wife Kathy Panama reside in London and Australia. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (3) John Williams John Williams is internationally regarded as one of the foremost players of Irish music today. With five All-Ireland titles to his credit, John is the only American-born competitor ever to win first place in the &quot;senior concertina&quot; category. His additional talents on flute, button accordion, bodhran, and piano distinguish him as a much sought after multi-instrumentalist in the acoustic scene around the world. Born and raised on the Southwest Side of Chicago, John spent his summers during college on the Southwest coast of Ireland in his father's village of Doolin, Co. Clare. Like Chicago, Doolin became a major musical crossroads for John and countless other local and international musicians to meet and exchange music. Gigging every night in the pubs of Doolin and Lisdoonvarna soon led to performances in Galway, Cork, Dublin, Belfast, Paris, Britanny, Zurich, and New York City (bio http://www. johnwilliamsmusic. com/bio. htm ). &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (4) John Williams A blues/jazz guitarist in Seattle, Washington, whose music is available at Magnatune. com (bio http://magnatune. com/artists/john_williams ). &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (5) John Knowles Williams An experimental/indie musician.

Led by guitarist/vocalist Stuart Murdoch, the seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and &#x27;60s pop. Murdoch has a gift not only for whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail which keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. Based in Glasgow, Scotland, Belle and Sebastian released their first two albums in 1996: Tigermilk, recorded over three days, and If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister, recorded in a week, at the peak of the chamber pop movement. At first, some critics in Britain&#x27;s music weeklies tied the band into the subgenre, yet the group was too pretty, too delicate, to bear that label. Through their first two years of public existence, the band shielded their personalities, submitting publicity photos featuring a girl, who was a friend of the band and reluctantly posing for photo shoots. Furthermore, they performed in odd venues, playing not only the standard coffeehouses and cafes, but also homes, church halls, and libraries. Prior to the formation of Belle and Sebastian, Murdoch suffered from a protracted battle with chronic fatigue syndrome, which forced him to drop out of school and spend seven years living in his parents&#x27; home crippled by his condition. Whilst in his parents home, Murdoch wrote a short story about a boy named Sebastian and a girl named Isabelle based on the names from Madame Cecile Aubery&#x27;s children&#x27;s book Belle et Sebastian. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1996, Stuart attended a party at which he met a young singer and cellist named Isobel Campbell. In a letter to his brother Fraser, Murdoch explained how he was making a single for Stow college at the end of February. Murdoch opted to use the name Belle&amp;Sebastian for the project because it was occupying him at the time. Murdoch took to songwriting as an escapism from the four walls surrounding him in his room and eventually recorded demos with bassist Stuart David whom he met at a government training programme called Beatbox. Murdoch quickly met a series of other musicians through social and musical circles in his hometown Glasgow and they agreed to help with the Stow project. The members he found for this initial lineup were Stevie Jackson (guitar), Mick Cooke (trumpet), Chris Geddes (keyboards), Stuart David (bass), Richard Colburn (drums), and Isobel Campbell (cello). The Stow College record was to be issued by Electric Honey, but it turned into a full album. The course instructor Alan Rankine determined that Murdoch had enough good material to record a full LP and could do so if they could get it all done in three days, studio time allotted for the single. Murdoch and his musicians rose to the challenge and recorded ten tracks putting the songs in order as they would appear on the record and mostly completing them in just a few takes. In May of 1996, Belle and Sebastian self-released their debut album, Tigermilk, on Electric Honey Records. Only 1,000 copies of the album, which was only pressed on vinyl, were released, but it unexpectedly became a sensation, earning terrific word of mouth throughout the UK. As a result, the band became slightly more than a school project -- it became an actual band. If You&#x27;re Feeling Sinister, released on the independent Jeepster label, followed in November of 1996. By the time the album was released in America on the EMI subsidiary The Enclave, it had earned considerable critical acclaim in the U. K. -- not only from music weeklies, but from newspapers like The Sunday Times and magazines like The Face -- and a large cult following; by some accounts, Tigermilk was being sold for as much as 75 pounds. Over the course of 1997, word of mouth continued to grow in America, even as the band pulled out of an American tour because The Enclave went bankrupt and closed. As the band cult continued to build in 1997, Belle and Sebastian released three EPs -- Dog on Wheels (May), Lazy Line Painter Jane (July), and 3. . 6. . 9 Seconds of Light (October). Each subsequent EP placed higher on the indie charts and received great critical acclaim. Later in the year, violinist Sarah Martin became a member of the band. By the end of the year, the group finalized an American deal with Matador Records, issuing The Boy With the Arab Strap in September 1998. The following year saw the eagerly anticipated wide re-release of Tigermilk , the album that started it all. It was the biggest selling album but is unpopular with the group themselves. Following completion of 2000&#x27;s Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant, Stuart David left Belle and Sebastian to focus full-time on his solo project, Looper, being replaced by Bobby Kildea of V-Twin. In 2001, the group released two EPs -- Jonathan David and I&#x27;m Waking Up to Us -- and recorded the soundtrack for Todd Solondz&#x27;s film Storytelling . Just before the soundtrack&#x27;s release in spring 2002, Belle and Sebastian embarked on a comprehensive tour of the United States and Canada before returning to Europe for the summer festival season. Midway through the tour, Isobel Campbell left the band, citing the usual differences. Another major change that soon took place was the band leaving Jeepster and Matador to sign with Rough Trade, with their next record, late 2003&#x27;s Dear Catastrophe Waitress, produced by the inimitable Trevor Horn (who also produced Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Yes, and scores of others). The record spawned the brilliant &quot;Step into My Office, Baby&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m a Cuckoo&quot; singles, the latter of which was the group&#x27;s biggest U. K. hit, reaching number 14 in early 2004. After a long worldwide tour that found Belle and Sebastian reaching new levels of success, they retired to Scotland and began preparing for the recording of their seventh full length album, The Life Pursuit, released in 2006. In 2010, they released their eighth full length album, Write About Love. Official website: www. belleandsebastian. com", "Genesis": "At least two artists have used the name &quot;Genesis&quot;: 1. A British progessive rock band 2. A 60s psychedelic band from Los Angeles, California For the Colombian band, please see Genesis. 1. Genesis formed in 1967 in Godalming, Surrey, United Kingdom was one of the most popular progressive rock bands in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. During the 1970s, Peter Gabriel was the lead singer until his departure, when drummer Phil Collins stepped up to the mic and replaced him. Starting as an amalgam of two bands formed by schoolboys attending Charterhouse School in Godalming, England, the original lineup consisted of Peter Gabriel, Anthony Phillips , Tony Banks , Mike Rutherford , and Chris Stewart , though Stewart was soon replaced as drummer by John Silver and then John Mayhew . By the end of 1970, Phillips and Mayhew had left the band, with Collins joining as drummer, and by early 1971, guitarist Steve Hackett had filled the gap left by Phillips. The lineup of Gabriel, Banks, Hackett, Rutherford, and Collins remained in place until Gabriel&#x27;s departure in 1975. During the period of 1970-1975, the band produced some of the most widely-acclaimed albums of the progressive rock era, including &quot; Nursery Cryme &quot;, &quot; Foxtrot &quot; ( featuring the side-long epic &quot; Supper&#x27;s Ready &quot; ) and the seminal album &quot; Selling England by the Pound &quot;, which generated Genesis&#x27; first foray into the charts with &quot; I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe) &quot;. This lineup culminated with the band&#x27;s magnum opus &quot; The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway &quot; in 1974. Following the tour promoting the album, frontman Peter Gabriel left the group in mid 1975. Genesis decided to continue on as a four-piece, producing two albums, &quot; A Trick of the Tail &quot; and &quot; Wind &amp; Wuthering &quot;, which found the band proving to themselves and to the world that they could move on after Gabriel&#x27;s departure. Collins stepped up to fill the role of lead vocalist after countless auditions for a new singer proved fruitless by the completion of recording for &quot; A Trick of the Tail &quot;. Hackett quietly departed after the &quot; Wind &amp; Wuthering &quot; tour in 1977, feeling that his creative input for the band was being repressed. In 1978, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford contributed music to a British movie called &quot;The Shout&quot; based on a short story by Robert Graves, directed by Jerzy Skomilowski and produced by Jeremy Thomas. (More credits and info here http://www. imdb. com/title/tt0078259/combined ) Genesis then became a trio which began to move away from the dying embers of progressive rock. They established themselves as a more commercially-friendly outfit with the release of their 1978 album &quot; &#8230;And Then There Were Three&#8230; &quot;, finding their first US hit with the single &quot; Follow You Follow Me &quot;. Banks, Rutherford, and Collins became more adept at writing radio-friendly songs in the 1980s. This reached a peak with the release of 1986&#x27;s &quot; Invisible Touch &quot;, in which more than half of the album&#x27;s eight songs made it to the singles chart, including the title track, &quot; Land of Confusion &quot; and &quot; In Too Deep &quot;. All three band members produced solo albums during Genesis&#x27; downtime in the 80s and 90s - most notably Collins&#x27; increasingly successful solo work, and Rutherford&#x27;s sideline group &quot; Mike and the Mechanics &quot; which found moderate success - with evolving styles reflected both solo and when recording together as Genesis. Collins left the group in 1996, and was replaced vocally by Ray Wilson , the former lead singer of Scottish band &quot; Stiltskin &quot;. Israeli born drummer Nir Zidkyahu and &quot; Spock&#x27;s Beard &quot; drummer Nick D&#x27;Virgilio stepped in to fill the drumming role. Their 1997 album &quot; Calling All Stations &quot; was unable to find worldwide success, and despite scoring a minor U. K. hit with &quot; Congo &quot;, the group slowly faded out of public consciousness. In 1998, after the &quot; Calling All Stations &quot; tour ( the US leg of which was cut short due to poor album sales ), Wilson was released from the band, and Zidkyahu and D&#x27;Virgilio, having never been &quot;official&quot; band members, went their separate ways. The band, now down to only Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford, took a break from performing and recording. In 1999 Banks, Rutherford, Collins, Gabriel, and Hackett collaborated to re-record &quot; The Carpet Crawlers &quot; for greatest hits compilation &quot; Turn It on Again: The Hits &quot;. During the latter part of 2005, rumors spread that the band would reform again in its most famous five-man configuration. Genesis management stated that there were no current plans at that time, and that nothing would change in the following twelve months. Phil Collins then said in a radio interview in April 2006 that the classic Genesis line-up was considering a new live-staging of &quot; The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway &quot;, but it was not to be. On 7th November 2006, Phil Collins, Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford announced they would be doing a twenty-date tour of Europe in the summer of 2007, with a North American tour to follow. A Live DVD of the final European concert in Rome, where the band performed free for 500,000 fans, was released May 26th 2008: &quot;When In Rome - Live 2007&quot;. In April of 2011, Phil Collins, after completing a reunion tour with Genesis, said in a newspaper interview that he has no plans to tour or make another album, effectively retiring after over 40 years in the music business. Official website: www. genesis-music. com 2. In 1967-8, there was an American band that was also named Genesis. It was a psychedelic rock group based in Los Angeles which released one album In the Beginning in 1968. The name conflict was known to the record label of UK Genesis, which is why their debut album From Genesis to Revelation coyly omitted the band&#x27;s name except in the album title. While both bands suffered poor sales for their debuts, the US band broke up in late 1968 not long after one of their members was drafted into the army. This more or less ended any significant confusion except in situations like Last. fm or lazy Googling. 3. A Colombian group called Genesis also exists. If you are scrobbling songs by that group and have ended up on this page, please fix your tags to Genesis with the first &quot;e&quot; accented. ", "Boogarins": "Excellent 60s summertime vibes from this Brazilian psychedelic foursome. This one came out of absolutely nowhere, and is easily one of the better submissions to appear in our inbox recently. Although As Plantas Que Curam doesn&#x27;t boast the same squeaky clean studio recording quality as Tame Impala/Foxygen/Jacco Gardner&#x27;s most recent records, this debut EP will certainly catch the attention of those who&#x27;ve been loving those records. There&#x27;s also something about their sound that instantly transported me back to when I heard Dungen for the first time almost 10 years ago. Now I just need Winter to release its death grip on Richmond, VA so I can roll the car windows down to this one. Highly recommended. - Dan, Ongakubaka blog. ", "Basement": "Basement are a alternative rock/emo band from Ipswich, Suffolk, UK consisting of five members, Alex, Andrew, Duncan, James and Ronan. Signed to Run For Cover records, Basement has released a 2009 demo, one EP, Songs About The Weather (2010) as well as two albums; I Wish I Could Stay Here (2011) and Colourmeinkindness (2012). The band went on hiatus due to personal commitments after their This is Goodbye tour, with their last sold out shows in Leeds and London in November 2012. On January 29th, 2014 Basement released the following statement: &quot;In the autumn of 2012 we made a decision as a band to put things on hold, as many of us had other commitments in our lives that needed to take priority. Almost two years on, for the most part now settled in where we want to be, it feels like there is space for change. When we put out the hiatus statement, we genuinely thought we were going to be away for quite a while, and we didn't see any chance of having free time to do anything other than focus on our professional lives. We're glad that this is not the case. We are really excited to say that Basement will be playing shows this summer, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone again. Thank you so much for your continued support.

Twitter. com/Basementuk Basement was created at the end of 1995 inspired by various American bands such as Jesus Lizard, Unsane, Fugazi, Cop shoot cop or Distorted Pony. The band&#x27;s first EP entitled \"Head on\" was recorded by Fred Norguet (Burning Heads, Portobello Bones, Ez3kiel&#8230;) and was released by Weird records/Tripsichord in October 1996. This dark spellbinding hardcore record came to tease the successful Amphetamine Reptile company. After touring all over France, the band went back to the studio to record their second EP. Just like \"Head on\", \"Underneath\" was produced by Fred Norguet but was released by Vicious Circle/Pias in March 1998. This record proved that the band deserved its place in the French noise and Post hardcore music world. The three members of Basement spent the following two years playing their songs on stage in France and Europe and were selected for the FAIR in 2000. 2007 marks the return of Basement after a quite long break. There is now a fourth member in the band and they have just released a new record, \"Everything gets distorted\", made of 8 tense songs combining strength and melody. This time the band has worked with the French producer Nicolas Dick (Kill the Thrill), Jean Michel Gimenez (Tantrum / cover and artwork), Interference (management) and After Before (booking). With a ten year long existence and after two records and more than 500 shows, Basement is back and ready to prove it on stage all over Europe and USA. . New Ep &quot;Counterclockwise&quot;, recorded and mixed by Serge Morattel at RecStudio, Geneva (CH), October/November 2013, mastered at Golden Mastering, Los Angeles (USA), April 2014, is available now on SomeProdukt and DayOff. Artwork : Brian Cougar https://basementfurianoise. bandcamp. com/", "Hole": "Hole was an American alternative rock band that formed in Los Angeles, California in 1989 by singer-songwriter and guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson. The band went through various lineups through the subsequent decades before its dissolution in 2002. In 2009, frontwoman Love re-formed Hole with lead guitarist Micko Larkin (formerly of Larrikin Love), Shawn Dailey (of Rock Kills Kid) on bass, and Stuart Fisher (formerly of Ozric Tentacles) on drums, but retired the Hole moniker in 2012, returning to work as a solo artist. Hole &#x27;s abrasive, self-consciously obnoxious style of alternative rock was initially influenced heavily by punk rock and noise rock and had a brief period as a three-guitar lineup, first with Eric Erlandson and Mike Geisbriecht, then briefly with the musician Errol Stewart. The band released two singles, firstly &quot;Retard Girl&quot; in 1990 and then &quot;Dicknail&quot; in 1991, both on independent record labels. The lineup that recorded the band&#x27;s first album &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; (1991) was Love, lead guitarist Eric Erlandson, bassist Jill Emery and drummer Caroline Rue. The album, which was produced by Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon, was critically praised by rock journalists despite its limited popularity in the United States; overseas, however, the album was a hit within the UK rock scene, and its lead single, &quot;Teenage Whore&quot; entered the UK indie rock chart at number one. After touring an extensive tour of Europe and the United States, Rue was fired from the band in 1992 and Emery left soon after, to be replaced by Leslie Hardy and Patty Schemel, respectively. Hardy left without contributing to the band, and was subsequently replaced by Kristen Pfaff of Janitor Joe in 1993. This lineup then recorded and released the hugely successful album &quot;Live Through This&quot; (1994) which found the band following a more commercial grunge sound. The album was released in April 1994, and in poor timing, just 4 days after Courtney Love&#x27;s husband Kurt Cobain committed suicide. Nonetheless, &quot;Live Through This&quot; was massively acclaimed by critics and earned #1 slots in &quot;Best Album of the Year&quot; lists and sold extremely well. It spawned a string of singles, most notably &quot;Doll Parts&quot; and &quot;Violet&quot;. Bassist Kristen Pfaff died of a heroin overdose shortly after the album was released, and the band left the public eye for the entire summer of 1994, dropping out of various festivals and canceling shows. In September the band made their first public appearance since Cobain&#x27;s death, and Melissa Auf der Maur replaced Pfaff on bass for their following tour. The band then took almost 4 years to release follow up album &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; in 1998 due to Courtney Love&#x27;s burgeoning film career. During the recording sessions, Patty Schemel left the band and was replaced by a session drummer on the album. &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; once again found the band taking a different approach to the previous record, experimenting with California-inspired rock and power pop. Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins, a longtime friend of Love&#x27;s, helped write the music on several songs on the album. &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; went on to be the band&#x27;s most commercially successful album, with its lead single &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; making it to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks, and &quot;Malibu&quot; charting at number three. The band toured with Marilyn Manson briefly to support the album, but dropped out of the tour after arguments between Love and Manson on production costs due to Manson&#x27;s elaborate stage theatrics. The band then toured on their own thereafter, appearing notably at Sydney&#x27;s Big Day Out Festival in 1999. Samantha Maloney was hired as the band&#x27;s drummer on the tour. Melissa Auf der Maur then left the band in 1999 to join The Smashing Pumpkins. Due to Courtney Love&#x27;s acting career and legal issues with the surviving members of Nirvana, 2002 saw Courtney Love and Eric Erlandson, the two remaining members of the band, announce the dissolution of Hole . However, on June 17th, 2009 Courtney Love announced the return of Hole with new members Micko Larkin (Larrikin Love) on lead guitar, Shawn Dailey (Rock Kills Kid) on bass, and Stuart Fisher (Ozric Tentacles) on drums. The comeback album &quot;Nobodys Daughter&quot; was released in April 2010, and saw the band take yet another stylistic turn, focusing on more of a folk rock/singer songwriter approach. In December 2012, frontwoman Courtney Love announced she was returning to performing as a solo artist, and was retiring the Hole moniker. However, in May 2014, Love announced the possibility of a reunion featuring herself, Erlandson, Auf der Maur, and Schemel in 2015. ", "Bastille": "Bastille is a rock group from South London, England that formed in 2010. Bastille started out as a solo project by singer-songwriter Dan Smith, who later decided to form a band. The quartet consists of Dan Smith, Chris &#x27;Woody&#x27; Wood, Will Farquarson and Kyle Simmons. The name of the band comes from Bastille Day , which was the day when Smith was born. Bastille released their latest album, &#x27; Bad Blood &#x27;, on 4 March 2013 in the U. K. to international critical acclaim. Bastille debuted in June 2011 with their 7&quot; single, &quot;Flaws&quot;/&quot;Icarus&quot; (released on Young &amp; Lost Club). This was then followed by their EP &#x27; Laura Palmer &#x27; later in 2011. After adding a few more tracks online, the band received a lot of attention from indie rock fans on the web, helping secure some support slots. During the summer of 2011, they performed at a number of major UK festivals, including Glastonbury, Isle of Wight, and Blissfields. On 27 April 2012, &quot;Overjoyed&quot; came out, being the debut Virgin Records single from Bastille. This was confirmed by EMI on 1 May 2012. After the video release of &quot;Overjoyed&quot; on YouTube, &#x27;Q Magazine&#x27; introduced the song as its track of the day for 7 March 2012. Fans seemingly devoured the tune. &quot;Bad Blood&quot; was released on Virgin Records on 20 August 2012. Following the video release of &quot;Bad Blood&quot; on YouTube, Bastille were named &quot;The New Band of the Day&quot; by writers for &#x27;The Guardian&#x27; on 25 July 2012. In not too long, Bastille performed at the major UK Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2012. They played an October 2012 headline tour that brought them into the spotlight alongside Emeli Sande, with Swiss Lips supporting them. Bastille&#x27;s single &quot;Flaws&quot;/&quot;Icarus&quot; was featured in the soundtrack of the popular British Channel 4 television show &#x27;Made in Chelsea&#x27;.

Bastille played their first show outside of Europe on 3 December 2012 at Hong Kong&#x27;s Clockenflap Music &amp; Arts Festival. Bastille&#x27;s song &quot;Oblivion&quot; featured in the soundtrack of the television show The Vampire Diaries in the Season 4 Episode 9 titled &quot;O Come, All Ye Faithful&quot;. They supported Two Door Cinema Club on their UK tour throughout January/February 2013 and toured through Europe in April to promote their debut album. The band have also released two mixtapes : &quot;Other People&#x27;s Heartache Pt 1&quot; (featuring covers, among others, of &quot;Blue Jeans&quot; by Lana del Rey, &quot;The Rhythm of The Night&quot; by Corona) and &quot;Other People&#x27;s Heartache Pt 2&quot; (featuring covers, including, &quot;Sweet Nothing&quot; by Calvin Harris, &quot;No Scrubs&quot; by TLC and &quot;Dreams&quot; by Fleetwood Mac).

Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple induction in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. Cash was known for his deep, distinctive voice, the boom-chick-a-boom or &quot;freight train&quot; sound of his backing band (Tennessee Two / Tennessee Three), his demeanor, and his dark clothing, which earned him the nickname &quot;The Man in Black&quot; . He traditionally started his concerts with the introduction &quot;Hello, I&#x27;m Johnny Cash. &quot; Much of Cash&#x27;s music, especially that of his later career, echoed themes of sorrow, moral tribulation, and redemption. His signature songs include &quot;I Walk the Line&quot;, &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, &quot;That Old Wheel&quot; (a duet with Hank Williams Jr. ), &quot;Cocaine Blues&quot;, and &quot;Man in Black&quot;. He also recorded several humorous songs, such as &quot;One Piece at a Time&quot;, &quot;The One on the Right Is on the Left&quot;, &quot;Dirty Old Egg-Sucking Dog&quot; and &quot;A Boy Named Sue&quot;; rock-and-roll numbers such as &quot;Get Rhythm&quot;; and various railroad songs, such as &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; and &quot;Orange Blossom Special&quot;. He sold over 90 million albums in his nearly fifty-year career and came to occupy a &quot;commanding position in music history&quot; . Early life Johnny Cash was born J. R. Cash in Kingsland, Arkansas, United States, to Ray and Carrie Cash, and raised in Dyess, Arkansas. He was reportedly given the name &quot;J. R. &quot; because his parents could not agree on a name, only on initials. Giving children initials-only names, or a first name and middle initial only, was a common practice at the time. When he enlisted in the United States Air Force, the military would not accept initials as his name, so he adopted John R. Cash as his legal name. Then when signing with Sun Records in 1955, he took Johnny Cash as his stage name. His friends and in-laws generally called him John, while his blood relatives often continued to call him by his birth name, J. R. Cash was one of seven children: Reba Hancock, Jack, Joanne Cash-Yates, Tommy, Roy, and Louise Cash Garrett. His younger brother Tommy Cash also became a successful country artist. By age five, J. R. was working in the cotton fields, singing along with his family as they worked. The family farm was flooded on at least one occasion, which later inspired him to write the song Five Feet High And Rising. His family&#x27;s economic and personal struggles during the Depression shaped him as a person and inspired many of his songs, especially those about other people facing similar difficulties. Cash was very close to his brother Jack, who was two years older. In 1944, Jack was pulled into a whirling table saw in the mill where he worked, and cut almost in two. He suffered for over a week before he died. There was some talk that Jack&#x27;s death might not have been accidental; a local bully was seen running from the shop with blood on his shirt, shortly before Jack was found. However, Cash did not discuss that theory in his autobiography, nor the report in some circles that Cash made investigation of the incident a personal obsession. Cash often spoke of the horrible guilt he felt over this incident. According to Cash: The Autobiography, his father was away that morning, but he and his mother, and Jack himself, all had premonitions or a sense of foreboding about that day, and his mother urged Jack to skip work and go fishing with his brother. Jack insisted on working, as the family needed the money. On his deathbed, Jack said he had visions of Heaven and angels. Decades later, Cash spoke of looking forward to meeting his brother in Heaven. He wrote that he had seen his brother many times in his dreams, and that Jack always looked two years older than whatever age Cash himself was at that moment. It is widely thought that the dark side of his world view was shaped by this traumatic event. Cash&#x27;s early memories were dominated by gospel music and radio. Taught by his mother and a childhood friend, Johnny began playing guitar and writing songs as a young boy. In high school he sang on a local radio station. Decades later, he would release an album of traditional gospel songs, called My Mother&#x27;s Hymn Book. Traditional Irish music that he heard weekly on the Jack Benny radio program, performed by Dennis Day, influenced him greatly. Cash enlisted in the United States Air Force. After basic training at Lackland Air Force Base and technical training at Brooks Air Force Base, both in San Antonio, Texas, Cash was assigned to a U. S. Air Force Security Service unit at Landsberg, Germany. Assigned as a morse code decoder on Russian Army transmissions, Cash was the first American to discover that Josef Stalin had died. First marriage While in Air Force training in 1950, Cash met Vivian Liberto. A month after his discharge, on August 7, 1954, he and Vivian were married. They had four daughters: Rosanne (1955), Kathleen (1956), Cindy (1959), and Tara (1961). However, his constant touring and drug use put intense strain on his marriage, and they divorced in 1966. Early career In 1954, the couple moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where he sold appliances, while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist Luther Perkins and bassist Marshall Grant. Perkins and Grant were known as the Tennessee Two. Cash worked up the courage to visit the Sun Records studio, hoping to get a recording contract. After auditioning for Sam Phillips, singing mostly gospel songs, Phillips told him to &quot;go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell. &quot; Cash eventually won over Phillips with new songs delivered in his early frenetic style. His first recordings at Sun, &quot;Hey Porter&quot; and &quot;Cry Cry Cry,&quot; were released in 1955 and met with reasonable success on the country hit parade. Cash&#x27;s next record, Folsom Prison Blues, made the country Top 5, and &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; became No. 1 on the country charts, also making it into the pop charts Top 20. Following &quot;I Walk the Line&quot; was Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Home of the Blues,&quot; recorded in July 1957. In 1957, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a long-playing album. Although he was Sun&#x27;s most consistently best-selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Elvis Presley had already left Sun, and Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Jerry Lee Lewis. The following year, Cash left the label to sign a lucrative offer with Columbia Records, where his single &quot;Don&#x27;t Take Your Guns to Town&quot; would become one of his biggest hits. In the early 60s, Cash toured with the Carter Family, which by this time regularly included Mother Maybelle&#x27;s daughters, Anita, June and Helen. June later recalled admiring Johnny from afar, during these tours. Outlaw Image As his career was taking off in the early 1960s, Cash started drinking heavily and became addicted to amphetamines and barbiturates. For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with Waylon Jennings, who was heavily addicted to amphetamines. Cash used the uppers to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his &quot;nervousness&quot; and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening drug addiction. Although in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash&#x27;s frenetic creativity was still delivering hits. His rendition of &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; was a crossover hit, reaching No. 1 on the country charts and entering the Top 20 on the pop charts. The song was written by June Carter and Merle Kilgore and originally performed by Carter&#x27;s sister, but the signature mariachi-style horn arrangement was provided by Cash, who said that it had come to him in a dream. The song describes the personal hell Carter went through as she wrestled with her forbidden love for Cash (they were both married to other people at the time) and as she dealt with Cash&#x27;s personal &quot;ring of fire&quot; (drug dependency and alcoholism). Cash sometimes spoke of his erratic, drug-induced behavior with some degree of bemused detachment. In June 1965, his truck caught fire due to an overheated wheel bearing, triggering a forest fire that burnt several hundred acres in Los Padres National Forest in California. When the judge asked Cash why he did it, Cash said in his characteristically flippant style at the time, &quot;I didn&#x27;t do it, my truck did, and it&#x27;s dead, so you can&#x27;t question it. &quot; The fire destroyed 508 acres (2. 06 km2), burning the foliage off three mountains and killing 49 of the refuge&#x27;s 53 endangered condors. Cash was unrepentant: &quot;I don&#x27;t care about your damn yellow buzzards. &quot; The federal government sued him and was awarded $125,127. Johnny eventually settled the case and paid $82,001. Cash said he was the only person ever sued by the government for starting a forest fire. Although Cash carefully cultivated a romantic outlaw image, he never served a prison sentence. Despite landing in jail seven times for misdemeanors, each stay lasted only a single night. His most infamous run-in with the law occurred while on tour in 1965, when he was arrested by a narcotics squad in El Paso, Texas. The officers suspected that he was smuggling heroin from Mexico, but it was prescription narcotics and amphetamines that the singer had hidden inside his guitar case. Because they were prescription drugs rather than illegal narcotics, he received a suspended sentence. Johnny Cash and his second wife, JuneCash was also arrested on May 11, 1965, in Starkville, Mississippi, for trespassing late at night onto private property to pick flowers. (This incident gave the spark for the song &quot;Starkville City Jail&quot;, which he spoke about on his live At San Quentin prison album. ) The mid 1960s saw Cash release a number of concept albums, including Ballads Of The True West (1965), an experimental double record mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash&#x27;s spoken narration, and Bitter Tears (1964), with songs highlighting the plight of the Native Americans. His drug addiction was at its worst at this point, however, and his destructive behavior led to a divorce from his first wife and cancelled performances. In 1967, Cash&#x27;s duet with Carter, &quot;Jackson&quot;, won a Grammy Award. Cash quit using drugs in 1968, after a spiritual epiphany in the Nickajack Cave. June, Maybelle, and Eck Carter moved into Cash&#x27;s mansion for a month to help him defeat his addiction. Cash proposed onstage to Carter at a concert at the London Gardens in London, Ontario on February 22, 1968; the couple married a week later in Franklin, Kentucky. June had agreed to marry Cash after he had &#x27;cleaned up&#x27;. Rediscovering his Christian faith, taking an &quot;altar call&quot; in Evangel Temple, a small church in the Nashville area, Cash chose this church over many larger, celebrity churches in the Nashville area because he said that there he was treated like just another parishioner and not a celebrity. Folsom Prison Blues While an airman in West Germany, Cash saw the B movie Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison (1951), which inspired him to write an early draft of one of his most famous songs, &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;. Cash felt great compassion for prisoners. He began performing concerts at various prisons starting in the late 1950s. These performances led to a pair of highly successful live albums, Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison (1968) and Johnny Cash at San Quentin (1969). The Folsom Prison record was introduced by a rendition of his classic &quot;Folsom Prison Blues,&quot; while the San Quentin record included the crossover hit single &quot;A Boy Named Sue,&quot; a Shel Silverstein-penned novelty song that reached No. 1 on the country charts and No. 2 on the U. S. Top Ten pop charts. The AM versions of the latter contained a couple of profanities which were edited out. The modern CD versions are unedited and uncensored and thus also longer than the original vinyl albums, though they still retain the audience reaction overdubs of the originals. Apart from his performances at Folsom Prison and San Quentin and various other U. S. correctional facilities, Cash also performed at the Osteraker Prison in Sweden in 1972. The live album Pa Osteraker (&quot;At Osteraker&quot;) was released in 1973. Between the songs, Cash can be heard speaking Swedish, which was greatly appreciated by the inmates. &quot;The Man in Black&quot; Cash advocated prison reform at his July 1972 meeting with U. S. president Richard NixonFrom 1969 to 1971, Cash starred in his own television show, The Johnny Cash Show, on the ABC network. The singing group The Statler Brothers opened up for him in every episode. Other notable artists who appeared on his show included Neil Young, Louis Armstrong, James Taylor, Ray Charles and Bob Dylan. Cash had met with Dylan in the mid 1960s and became closer friends when they were neighbors in the late 1960s in Woodstock, New York. Cash was enthusiastic about reintroducing the reclusive Dylan to his audience. Cash sang a duet with Dylan on Dylan&#x27;s country album Nashville Skyline and also wrote the album&#x27;s Grammy-winning liner notes. Another artist who received a major career boost from The Johnny Cash Show was songwriter Kris Kristofferson. During a live performance of Kristofferson&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Mornin&#x27; Comin&#x27; Down,&quot; Cash made headlines when he refused to change the lyrics to suit network executives, singing the song with its references to marijuana intact: &quot;On the Sunday morning sidewalks / Wishin&#x27;, Lord, that I was stoned. &quot; By the early 1970s, he had crystallized his public image as &quot;The Man in Black. &quot; He regularly performed dressed all in black, wearing a long black knee-length coat. This outfit stood in contrast to the costumes worn by most of the major country acts in his day: rhinestone suit and cowboy boots. In 1971, Cash wrote the song &quot;Man in Black&quot; to help explain his dress code: &quot;We&#x27;re doing mighty fine I do suppose/In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes/But just so we&#x27;re reminded of the ones who are held back/Up front there ought to be a man in black. &quot; He and his band had initially worn black shirts because that was the only matching color they had among their various outfits. He wore other colors on stage early in his career, but he claimed to like wearing black both on and off stage. He stated that, political reasons aside, he simply liked black as his on-stage color. To this day, the United States Navy&#x27;s winter blue service uniform is referred to by sailors as &quot;Johnny Cashes,&quot; as the uniform&#x27;s shirt, tie, and trousers are actually solid black in color. In the mid 1970s, Cash&#x27;s popularity and number of hit songs began to decline, but his autobiography (the first of two), titled Man in Black, was published in 1975 and sold 1. 3 million copies. A second, Cash: The Autobiography, appeared in 1997. His friendship with Billy Graham led to the production of a movie about the life of Jesus, The Gospel Road, which Cash co-wrote and narrated. The decade saw his religious conviction deepening, and he made many public appearances in an evangelical capacity. He also continued to appear on television, hosting an annual Christmas special on CBS throughout the 1970s. Later television appearances included a role in an episode of Columbo. He also appeared with his wife on an episode of Little House on the Prairie entitled &quot;The Collection&quot; and gave a performance as John Brown in the 1985 Civil War television mini-series North and South. He was friendly with every U. S. President starting with Richard Nixon. He was probably closest with Jimmy Carter, who became a very close friend. None of these friendships were about politics (although he supported the Democratic Party). He stated that he found all of them personally charming, noting the fact that it was probably essential to getting oneself elected. When invited to perform at the White House for the first time in 1972, President Richard Nixon&#x27;s office requested that he play &quot;Okie from Muskogee&quot; (a Merle Haggard satirical song about the people who disrespected the youthful drug users and war protesters) and &quot;Welfare Cadillac&quot; (a Guy Drake song that derides the integrity of welfare recipients). Cash declined to play either song and instead played a series of more left-leaning, politically charged songs, including &quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes&quot; (about a brave Native-American World War II veteran who was racially mistreated upon his return to Arizona), and his own compositions, &quot;What is Truth?&quot; and &quot;Man in Black. &quot; Cash claimed that the reasons for denying Nixon&#x27;s song choices were not knowing them and having fairly short notice to rehearse them, rather than any political reason. Highwaymen From left to right Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, who formed the country music supergroup, The HighwaymenIn 1980, Cash became the Country Music Hall of Fame&#x27;s youngest living inductee at age forty-eight, but during the 1980s his records failed to make a major impact on the country charts, although he continued to tour successfully. In the mid 1980s, he recorded and toured with Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson as The Highwaymen, making two hit albums. During this period, Cash appeared as an actor in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in The Pride of Jesse Hallam. Cash won fine reviews for his work in this film that called attention to adult illiteracy. In 1983, Cash also appeared as a heroic sheriff in Murder In Coweta County, which co-starred Andy Griffith as his nemesis. This film was based on a real-life Georgia murder case. Cash had tried for years to make the film, for which he won acclaim. Cash relapsed into addiction after a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an unusual incident in which he was kicked and critically wounded by an ostrich he kept on his farm. He was administered painkillers as part of the recovery process, which led to a return to substance abuse. At a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent double bypass surgery in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a &quot;near death experience&quot;. He said he had visions of Heaven that were so beautiful that he was angry when he woke up alive. Cash&#x27;s recording career and his general relationship with the Nashville establishment were at an all-time low in the 1980s. He realized that his record label of nearly 30 years, Columbia, was growing indifferent to him and wasn&#x27;t properly marketing him (he was &quot;invisible&quot; during that time, as he said in his autobiography). Cash recorded an intentionally awful song to protest, a self-parody. &quot;Chicken in Black&quot; was about Johnny&#x27;s brain being transplanted into a chicken. Ironically, the song turned out to be a larger commercial success than any of his other recent material. Nevertheless, he was hoping to kill the relationship with the label before they did, and it was not long after &quot;Chicken in Black&quot; that Columbia and Cash parted ways. In 1986, Cash returned to Sun Studios in Memphis to team up with Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Carl Perkins to create the album Class of &#x27;55. This was not the first time he had teamed up with Lewis and Perkins at Sun Studios. On December 4, 1956, Elvis Presley dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks, with Lewis backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio and the four started an impromptu jam session. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived and have been released on CD under the title Million Dollar Quartet. Tracks also include Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Brown Eyed Handsome Man&quot;, Pat Boone&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Forbid Me&quot;, and Elvis doing an impersonation of Jackie Wilson (who was then with Billy Ward and the Dominoes) singing &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Cruel&quot;. In 1986, Cash published his only novel, Man in White, a book about Saul and his conversion to become the Apostle Paul. He also recorded Johnny Cash Reads The Complete New Testament in 1990. American Recordings After Columbia Records dropped Cash from his recording contract, he had a short and unsuccessful stint with Mercury Records from 1987 to 1991 (see Johnny Cash discography). In 1991, Cash sang lead vocals on a cover version of &quot;Man in Black&quot; for the Christian punk band One Bad Pig&#x27;s album I Scream Sunday. His career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity among a younger audience not traditionally interested in country music. In 1993, he sang the vocal on U2&#x27;s &quot;The Wanderer&quot; for their album Zooropa. Although he was no longer sought after by major labels, Cash was approached by producer Rick Rubin and offered a contract with Rubin&#x27;s American Recordings label, better known for rap and hard rock. Under Rubin&#x27;s supervision, he recorded the album American Recordings (1994) in his living room, accompanied only by his guitar. The album featured several covers of contemporary artists selected by Rubin and saw much critical and commercial success, winning a Grammy for Best Contemporary Folk Album. Cash wrote that his reception at the 1994 Glastonbury Festival was one of the highlights of his career. This was the beginning of a decade of music industry accolades and surprising commercial success. Cash and his wife appeared on a number of episodes of the popular television series Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman starring Jane Seymour. The actress thought so highly of Cash that she later named one of her twin sons after him. He did a cameo in an episode of The Simpsons, playing the voice of a coyote that guides Homer on a spiritual quest. In 1996, Cash released a sequel to American Recordings, Unchained, and enlisted the accompaniment of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, which won a Grammy for Best Country Album. Cash, believing he did not explain enough of himself in his 1975 autobiography Man in Black, wrote another autobiography in 1997 entitled Cash: The Autobiography. Illness and death In 1997, Cash was diagnosed with the neurodegenerative disease Shy-Drager syndrome. The diagnosis was later altered to autonomic neuropathy associated with diabetes. This illness forced Cash to curtail his touring. He was hospitalized in 1998 with severe pneumonia, which damaged his lungs. The albums American III: Solitary Man (2000) and American IV: The Man Comes Around (2002) contained Cash&#x27;s response to his illness in the form of songs of a slightly more somber tone than the first two American albums. The video for &quot;Hurt&quot;, generally recognized as &#x27;his epitaph&#x27;, from American IV received particular critical and popular acclaim. June Carter Cash died of complications following heart valve replacement surgery on May 15, 2003, at the age of seventy-three. June had told Cash to keep working, so he continued to record and even performed a couple of surprise shows at the Carter Family Fold outside Bristol, Virginia. (The July 5, 2003, concert was his final public appearance. ) At the June 21, 2003, concert, before singing &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, Cash read a statement about his late wife that he had written shortly before taking the stage. He spoke of how June&#x27;s spirit was watching over him and how she had come to visit him before going on stage. He barely made it through the song. Despite his health issues, he spoke of looking forward to the day when he could walk again and toss his wheelchair into the river near his home. Less than four months after his wife&#x27;s death, Johnny Cash died on September 12, 2003, while hospitalized at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, Tennessee. He was 71. He was interred next to his wife in Hendersonville Memory Gardens near his home in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Cash is survived by his children and 16 grandchildren. On May 24, 2005, Vivian Liberto, Cash&#x27;s first wife and the mother of Rosanne Cash, died from surgery to remove lung cancer. It was Rosanne Cash&#x27;s fiftieth birthday. In June 2005, his lakeside home on Caudill Drive in Hendersonville, Tennessee, went up for sale by the Cash estate. In January 2006, the house was sold to Bee Gees vocalist Barry Gibb and wife Linda Gibb and titled in their Florida limited liability company for $2. 3 million. The listing agent was Cash&#x27;s younger brother, Tommy Cash. The home was destroyed by fire on April 10, 2007. One of Johnny Cash&#x27;s final collaborations with producer Rick Rubin, entitled American V: A Hundred Highways, was released posthumously on July 4, 2006. The album debuted in the #1 position on Billboard Magazine&#x27;s Top 200 album chart the week ending July 22, 2006. The vocal parts of the track were recorded before Cash&#x27;s death, but the other instruments were not recorded until about 2005. American VI, an expected final release, has yet to be issued. Legacy From his early days as a pioneer of rockabilly and rock and roll in the 1950s, to his decades as an international representative of country music, to his resurgence to fame in the 1990s as a living legend and an alternative country icon, Cash influenced countless artists and left a large body of work. Upon his death, Cash was revered by the greatest popular musicians of his time. Among Johnny Cash&#x27;s children, his daughter Rosanne Cash (by first wife Vivian Liberto) and his son John Carter Cash (by June Carter Cash) are notable country-music musicians in their own right. Cash nurtured and defended artists on the fringes of what was acceptable in country music even while serving as the country music establishment&#x27;s most visible symbol. At an all-star TNT concert in 1999, a diverse group of artists paid him tribute, including Bob Dylan, Chris Isaak, Wyclef Jean, Norah Jones, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson, and U2. Cash himself appeared at the end and performed for the first time in more than a year. Two tribute albums were released shortly before his death; Kindred Spirits contains works from established artists, while Dressed in Black contains works from many lesser-known artists. In total, he wrote over a thousand songs and released dozens of albums. A box set titled Unearthed was issued posthumously. It included four CDs of unreleased material recorded with Rubin as well as a Best of Cash on American retrospective CD. In recognition of his lifelong support of SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, his family invited friends and fans to donate to that charity in his memory. He had a personal link with the SOS village in Diessen, at the Ammersee-Lake in Southern Germany, near where he was stationed as a GI, and also with the SOS village in Barrett Town, by Montego Bay near his holiday home in Jamaica. The Johnny Cash Memorial Fund was founded and contributions can be made here. In 1999, Cash received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked Johnny Cash #31 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In a tribute to Cash after his death, country music superstar Gary Allan included the song &quot;Nickajack Cave (Johnny Cash&#x27;s Redemption)&quot; on his 2005 album entitled Tough All Over. The song chronicles Cash hitting rock bottom and subsequently resurrecting his life and career. For a period of time, there was a museum called the &quot;House of Cash&quot;, but it is no longer in operation. Highway 31E, Hendersonville&#x27;s Main Street, is known as &quot;Johnny Cash Parkway&quot;. On November 2 - November 4, 2007 the Johnny Cash Flower Pickin&#x27; Festival was held in Starkville, Mississippi, the city where Cash had been arrested over 40 years earlier and held overnight at the city jail on May 11, 1965, inspiring Cash to write the song &quot;Starkville City Jail&quot;. The festival, where he was offered a symbolic posthumous pardon, honored Cash&#x27;s life and music, and is expected to become an annual event. Portrayals In 1998, country singer Mark Collie portrayed Cash for the first time in a short film, &quot;I Still Miss Someone&quot;. Shot mostly in black and white, it attempts to capture a moment in time for Cash during his darkest years, the mid 1960s. Walk the Line, an Academy Award-winning biopic about Johnny Cash&#x27;s lifetime starring Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter Cash (for which she won the 2005 Best Actress Oscar), was released in the U. S. on November 18, 2005 to considerable commercial success and great critical acclaim. Both Phoenix and Witherspoon have won various other awards for their roles, including the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, respectively. They both performed their own vocals in the film, and Phoenix learned to play guitar for his role as Johnny Cash. Phoenix received the Grammy Award for his contributions to the Walk the Line soundtrack. Ring of Fire, a jukebox musical of the Cash oeuvre, debuted on Broadway on March 12, 2006 at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, but closed due to harsh reviews and disappointing sales on April 30, 2006. Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, a comedy film parodying biopic films such as Walk the Line and Ray, is a close parody of Cash&#x27;s life and the way he was portrayed in Walk the Line. Heritage Cash was completely of Scottish heritage, but he learned this only upon researching his ancestry. After a chance meeting with former Falkland laird, Major Michael Crichton-Stuart, he traced the Cash family tree to eleventh century Fife, Scotland. He had believed in his younger days that he was mainly Irish and partially Native American (he had been told he was one-quarter Cherokee). Even after learning he had no Native American ancestry, Cash&#x27;s empathy and compassion for Native Americans was unabated. These feelings were expressed in several of his songs, including Apache Tears and The Ballad of Ira Hayes, and on his album, Bitter Tears. Lists of accomplishments Cash received multiple Country Music Awards, Grammys, and other awards, in categories ranging from vocal and spoken performances to album notes and videos. In a career that spanned almost five decades, Cash was the personification of country music to many people around the world. Cash was a musician who was not tied to a single genre. He recorded songs that could be considered rock and roll, blues, rockabilly, folk, and gospel, and exerted an influence on each of those genres. Moreover, he had the unique distinction among country artists of having &quot;crossed over&quot; late in his career to become popular with an unexpected demographic, young indie and alternative rock fans. His diversity was evidenced by his presence in three major music halls of fame: the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame (1977), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1980), and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1992). Only thirteen performers are in both of the last two, and only Hank Williams Sr. , Jimmie Rodgers, and Bill Monroe share the honor with Cash of being in all three. However, only Cash was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the regular manner, unlike the other country members, who were inducted as &quot;early influences. &quot; His pioneering contribution to the genre has also been recognized by the Rockabilly Hall of Fame. He received the Kennedy Center Honors in 1996. Cash stated that his induction into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1980 was his greatest professional achievement. In 2007 Johnny Cash was inducted into the Hit Parade Hall of Fame. ", "Ellie Goulding": "Ellie Goulding (born Elena Jane Goulding on 30 December 1986) is an English singer-songwriter. Born in Hereford, she grew up in Kington, Herefordshire and currently lives in London, England. After studying drama at the University of Kent for a couple of years, Goulding moved to West London for the purpose of developing her songs and music career. Touring since 2008 she released her debut single &quot;Under the Sheets&quot; on 15 November 2009. The track was produced by Starsmith, with whom she has been working since the beginning of her career. On 8 January 2010, Goulding topped the BBC Sound of 2010 music list. Previous winners include the likes of Little Boots, Corinne Bailey Rae and Mika. On 16 February 2010, she won the Critics&#x27; Choice award at the BRIT Awards, which has previously been given to acts such as Adele and Florence + the Machine. Ellie Goulding&#x27;s debut album Lights was released on 1 March 2010 and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was re-released 29 November 2010 as Bright Lights with six new tracks. It produced two additional singles: &quot;Your Song,&quot; a cover of Elton John&#x27;s song (which went on to become her biggest single to date in the UK, reaching number two) and the title track &quot;Lights (single version). &quot; Following this re-release, the album saw a surge in sales in both the UK and Ireland. On March 8, 2011, the album was released in the United States with alternate cover art and featuring three songs that were previously not on the original version but were included on Bright Lights , those songs being &quot;Lights,&quot; &quot;Animal,&quot; and &quot;Your Song. &quot; Goulding&#x27;s second album Halcyon was released on 8 October 2012. The first single from the album, &quot;Anything Could Happen,&quot; was released digitally in the UK on 30 September 2012. Goulding co-wrote three songs for Diana Vickers debut album Songs From The Tainted Cherry Tree , titled &quot;Remake Me &amp; You&quot;, &quot;Notice&quot; and &quot;Jumping Into Rivers&quot; (all three co-written with Vickers and Guy Sigsworth). She also co-wrote a track with George Astasio, Gabriella Cilmi, Jason Pebworth and Jon Shave for Cilmi&#x27;s second album Ten , titled &quot;Love Me Cos You Want To&quot;. In 2015, Goulding released the worldwide #1 hit, &quot;Love Me Like You Do&quot;, from the box office success &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;. http://elliegoulding. com/", "Biosphere": "Biosphere is the main recording name of Geir Jenssen (born 1962 in Tromso, Norway), a musician who has released a notable catalog of ambient electronic music. He is well known for his &quot;ambient house&quot; then &quot;arctic ambient&quot; styles, and his use of music loops and peculiar samples from sci-fi sources. His track &quot;Novelty Waves&quot; was used for the 1995 Levi&#x27;s ad campaign. His 1997 album Substrata is generally seen as one of the all-time classic ambient albums. Before launching Biosphere, Jenssen was a member of the Norwegian dream pop band Bel Canto. Bel Canto released records on the Belgium-based label Crammed Discs. Some tracks are freely downloadable on Biosphere&#x27;s website . ", "Devin Townsend": "Devin Garret Townsend (born May 5, 1972) is a Canadian musician and record producer from New Westminster, British Columbia. He was the founder, songwriter, vocalist, and guitarist in extreme metal band Strapping Young Lad from 1994 to 2007 and has had an extensive career as a solo artist, in which his work usually leans more towards a progressive metal style. After performing in a number of metal bands in high school, Townsend was discovered by a record label in 1993 and was asked to perform lead vocals on Steve Vai&#x27;s album Sex &amp; Religion. After recording and touring with Vai, Townsend was discouraged by what he found in the music industry, and vented his anger on a solo album released under the pseudonym Strapping Young Lad. He soon assembled a band under the name, and released the critically acclaimed City in 1997. Since then, he has released three more studio albums with Strapping Young Lad, along with solo material released under his own independent record label, HevyDevy Records. Townsend&#x27;s solo albums, a diverse mix of hard rock and progressive metal, have featured a varying lineup of supporting musicians. In 2002 he formed The Devin Townsend Band, a dedicated lineup which recorded and toured for two of his solo releases. In 2007, Townsend disbanded both Strapping Young Lad and The Devin Townsend Band, taking a break from touring to spend more time with his family. After a two-year hiatus, he began work on a four-album series called The Devin Townsend Project, with each album written in a different style. The first two entries in the series, Ki and Addicted, were released in 2009. Townsend scheduled tours throughout Australia and North America in 2010 in support of the albums, and released the next two, Deconstruction and Ghost, in 2011. Townsend&#x27;s trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked wall of sound, has been compared to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend&#x27;s musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different aspects of his personality. ", "The Smashing Pumpkins": "The Smashing Pumpkins are an alternative rock band, formed in Chicago, Illinois, USA, in 1988. Billy Corgan and James Iha met in a record store, and began performing in local nightclubs with their bassist, D&#x27;arcy Wretzky, using a drum machine. Playing with a drum machine frustrated both the band and their audience, and so Chicago jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was hired soon afterwards. Less influenced by punk than many of their contemporaries, the Pumpkins had a densely layered, guitar-heavy sound, with powerful loud-to-soft-to-loud transitions, while still picking up grunge, heavy metal, power pop, psychedelic rock, shoegaze-style production. In later recordings, namely Adore, the fourth album, an electronica flair filtered in after Jimmy Chamberlin temporarily left the band for drug rehab. Though Jimmy Chamberlin returned for their fifth album, Machina/The Machines of God, electronica undertones remained. The emotional tone of bandleader Billy Corgan&#x27;s songs ranged from angry (X. Y. U. ) to dour (Disarm) to jubilant (Cherub Rock). Selling more than 18. 3 million albums in the United States alone (as of 2006), The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, diminishing sales, drug problems, cultural vitality, and what is speculated to be improper treatment from their record company, hampered the band in their later years, leading to the 2000 break-up. Prior to the complete dissolution of the original line-up, their final tour (dubbed &quot;Sacred and Profane&quot;), featured former Hole bassist Melissa Auf Der Maur to fill in the gap left by D&#x27;arcy Wretzky, who left in September of 1999. Besides touring with the band she also appeared in the videos accompanying &quot;Machina/The Machines of God&quot;. The band&#x27;s final album, &quot;MACHINA II / The Friends And Enemies of Modern Music&quot; was unofficially released on vinyl in 2000, prior to their break-up, with the record company refusing to back the band with a pressing. Only 25 vinyl copies were made, each signed by the band. The album was then released across various fan sites by those who received the album and transferred it digitally, as a final tribute to the band&#x27;s supporters. Problems have been seen since then with Billy Corgan, James Iha (who later joined A Perfect Circle), and D&#x27;arcy Wretzky, both of whom started their own record company Scratchie Records . Billy Corgan would continue from there first forming the band Zwan with members Matt Sweeney, Paz Lenchantin, David Pajo, and Jimmy Chamberlin. After a bad breakup shortly after their debut album Mary Star Of The Sea Billy turned solo and released the album TheFutureEmbrace. Jimmy Chamberlin formed the Jimmy Chamberlin Complex, and Corgan recorded vocals for them on the track entitled Loki Cat. In mid-april 2006 The Smashing Pumpkins &quot;reunited&quot; with original members Billy Corgan and Jimmy Chamberlin . They performed live as The Smashing Pumpkins for the first time in 6 and a half years on May 22, 2007 in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new members Jeff Schroeder, Ginger Reyes and Lisa Harriton who took over rhythm guitarist, bassist and keyboard duties respectively. The new line-up&#x27;s first studio album, titled &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;, was released on July 10, 2007 to mixed reviews. It debuted at #2 on the Billboard 200, and in the top ten for several other countries. On Jan 2, 2008 the Pumpkins released the American Gothic EP exclusively on iTunes as part of an expanded version of Zeitgeist. The four tracks: &quot;The Rose March&quot;, &quot;Again Again Again (The Crux)&quot;, &quot;Pox&quot;, and &quot;Sunkissed&quot; demonstrate a more acoustic sound when compared to the rest of Zeitgeist. In March, 2008 the group contributed the song &quot;Superchrist&quot; to a compilation CD released by Guitar Center. Though Corgan and Chamberlin have continued to record as a duo, Jeff Schroeder indicated that he might be contributing to future recordings. No longer signed to a record label, Corgan and Chamberlin purchased a recording studio in Chicago and began recording in May, again, as a pair. The band released the single G. L. O. W. on October 1st of 2008. On March 20, 2009, it was announced Jimmy Chamberlin had left the band, leaving Billy Corgan the only original member left in the band. It is reported Corgan plans to continue using the Smashing Pumpkins name and return to the studio to make new music. On August 17th, 2009, Mike Byrne was confirmed as the new Smashing Pumpkins drummer. Formally announced by the frontman Billy Corgan on September 16, 2009, the 44-song concept album Teargarden by Kaleidyscope will be released over the Internet, from the band&#x27;s official website for free, one song at a time. Available for download so far are: &quot;A Song for a Son&quot; from December 8, 2009; and &quot;Widow Wake My Mind&quot; from January 18, 2010. http://www. smashingpumpkins. com http://www. myspace. com/smashingpumpkins", "Halsey": "Halsey aka Ashley Frangipane is 20 years old and from New Jersey USA.

( http://www. myspace. com/betteroffhc )", "Slowdive": "Slowdive is a dream pop/shoegaze band that formed in 1989 in Reading, England, United Kingdom. Signed to Creation Records in 1990 and initially championed by the British music press, the band scored a UK top forty entry with their debut album Just For a Day . The band consists of Rachel Goswell (vocals/guitar), Neil Halstead (vocals/guitar), Nick Chaplin (bass), Christian Savill (guitar), and Simon Scott (drums, 1990-1994, 2014-present); additionally, Ian McCutcheon replaced Scott from 1994-1995. Goswell and Halstead had known each other since early childhood in Reading, Berkshire. Initial demos were released as the Slowdive EP in late 1990; the band&#x27;s sound was influenced by the Cocteau Twins and Creation labelmates My Bloody Valentine, featuring heavy use of guitar effects and muted vocals. Reviews in Melody Maker and the NME were enthusiastic, and two further well-regarded EPs followed in 1991 ( Morningrise &amp; Holding Our Breath ). Their debut LP Just for a Day was written and recorded in six weeks, and was generally felt to be a disappointment at the time. At the same time, the UK music press had started to pick up on the American grunge scene, and the more introspective sounds of Slowdive, labelmates Ride, Chapterhouse and other &quot;shoegazing&quot; bands had fallen from critical favour. American label SBK pushed back the release of Just for a Day after a disastrous viral marketing campaign (involving vandalism of a public statue). In early 1992, the band toured the USA with Ride, and then returned to the UK to record a second album. The band&#x27;s second album, Souvlaki, would later become generally the band&#x27;s most popular and well-received record. The album broke new ground for the band: two songs featured contributions from Brian Eno; &quot;Souvlaki Space Station&quot; was influenced by dub reggae; tracks such as &quot;Dagger&quot; and &quot;Here She Comes&quot; would become indications of the country-rock direction Halstead and Goswell would take a few years later; and several songs such as &quot;When the Sun Hits&quot; and &quot;Alison&quot; continued the style of the first album, but with improved songwriting. Initial copies of the UK version came with Blue Day , a compilation of most of the early EP tracks originally released as a separate album in Japan and some European countries. Later in the year, the band also released the 5 EP , containing four songs showcasing the influence of ambient techno; the lead track &quot;In Mind&quot; was also remixed by Bandulu and Reload (both then signed to Creation&#x27;s dance label). As with the first album, SBK delayed Souvlaki&#x27;s release, and the band found themselves touring the USA in the summer of 1993 as Catherine Wheel&#x27;s supporting act with no product to promote. The US version of Souvlaki was eventually released in early 1994, and included &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; (originally recorded for the Volume 7 compilation) and three of the tracks from the 5 EP . When Slowdive were finally able to tour America to support the album, SBK withdrew their funding halfway through; two further tours in 1994 were entirely funded by the band. Simon Scott left amidst creative differences in 1994; he was replaced on drums by Ian McCutcheon. The band had almost become a Halstead solo project by the recording of their final album, 1995&#x27;s Pygmalion . A critically misunderstood and widely-misinterpreted &quot;ambient&quot; record, Pygmalion took the dreamy guitar sound and warm-yet-solemn tone of earlier Slowdive to a newer, more minimalist extreme, similar to earlier dream pop bands such as A R Kane, or bands such as Labradford. Slowdive was dropped by Creation in 1995 a week after the release of Pygmalion ; Halstead had been warned before the recording of the album that the relationship with the label would end unless he delivered a &quot;pop album&quot;. A legend arose that the band was dropped due to the Gallagher brothers refusing to sign Oasis to Creation if Slowdive and their counterparts remained on the label&#x27;s roster, although Oasis had in fact released their debut single almost a year before Pygmalion . After being dropped from Creation, Slowdive eventually went on hiatus later in 1995. Neil Halstead, Rachel Goswell and Ian McCutcheon recorded an album of country-influenced songs, and were signed to label 4AD, changing the band name to Mojave 3. Halstead and Goswell have also both released solo albums for 4AD. Christian Savill went on to form Monster Movie, a dream pop group that continued where Slowdive left off. They have released three albums thus far, Last Night Something Happened (2002), To The Moon (2004), Transistor (2005), and--most recently-- All Lost (2006). Simon Scott formed Televise in 2004, a group which developed the lengthy noise swells and experimental song structures that helped define shoegaze while also including a more electronic brand of indie rock. Eventually, all of Slowdive&#x27;s albums were reissued in late 2005. Just For a Day included a bonus disc with all tracks from the first three EPs, and the three songs recorded for a John Peel session on 26 March 1991. Souvlaki included a bonus disc with all the remaining EP tracks, as well as &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; (originally recorded for a compilation). Pygmalion --which had become a collector&#x27;s item in the years since its release due to it never being issued in the USA--contained no extra material, however. On January 28, 2014, following a 12-day countdown and the appearance of an official website and Twitter account for the band, Slowdive announced their reunion with the Just for a Day / Souvlaki -era line-up including Simon Scott as drummer. The band was confirmed the same day to be playing the 2014 Primavera Sound Festival in Barcelona, Spain. ", "Metric": "Metric is an indie rock/New Wave band formed in 1998 in Toronto, Canada. The band members are Emily Haines (vocals, synths, guitar, tambourine), James Shaw (guitar, synths, theremin, backing vocals), Josh Winstead (bass, synths, backing vocals) and Joules Scott-Key (drums). The band name was inspired after a sound called &quot;Metric&quot; that was programmed by Shaw on his keyboard. They were based at various times at Toronto, Montreal, London, NYC and LA. So far, Metric released five studio albums: Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? (2003), Live It Out (2005), Grow Up and Blow Away (2007), Fantasies (2009), and Synthetica (2012). Besides Metric, Emily Haines and James Shaw also perform with Broken Social Scene. Joules Scott-Key and Joshua Winstead have their own side project, Bang Lime. Emily Haines released her debut album Cut in Half and Also Double in 1996 and two records under the moniker Emily Haines &amp; the Soft Skeleton: the album Knives Don&#x27;t Have Your Back in 2006 and the 6-track EP What Is Free to a Good Home? in 2007. She also has been a guest on albums by Stars, The Crystal Method, KC Accidental, Delerium, The Stills and Jason Collett. Emily Haines was born in New Delhi, India and raised since the age of 3 in Peterborough, Ontario. The daughter of poet Paul Haines grew up as a dual citizen of Canada and India. Her father would often make cassettes of rare and eclectic music for his daughter to listen to and her early influences included Carla Bley and Robert Wyatt. By her teens she followed her parents&#x27; footsteps by attending the Etobicoke School of the Arts. There she met Amy Millan and Kevin Drew, with whom she would later collaborate in hHead. Haines and Millan briefly formed their first band around 1990 while at ESA and with songs later written and recorded while at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 1992-1993, at Toronto in 1995 and at Concordia University in Montreal in 1995-1996, Haines distributed in 1996 an early effort called Cut in Half and Also Double with a limited number of copies. James Shaw was born in the UK. He was a student at a Boston music school and was friends with Torquil Campbell, a vocalist who would later form Stars and Chris Seligman, the future synthesizer player of Stars. Torquil had plans to move to New York City and on his suggestion Shaw applied to Juilliard Music School and moved to New York with him. In 1998, Shaw and Torquil returned to Toronto, where Haines met Shaw through mutual friends in the local music scene. Shaw moved to Montreal where Haines was still living and the two worked on filling out each other&#x27;s projects. The first song made by Shaw and Haines was &quot;Butcher&quot; and eventually they had completed in 1998 several other tracks in their home studio, gathered on Mainstream EP , a collection of demos with an overall downtempo and electronic feel. In the fall of 1998, Shaw moved back to New York City, this time accompanied by Haines, Campbell and Seligman. There they shared a loft in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn. During their two-year stay at the loft, Haines and Shaw were erstwhile room mates with future members of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Liars and TV on the Radio. Haines and Shaw set off to London in early 2000 and signed a publishing deal with Chrysalis Records. With the help of producer Stephen Hague, Metric worked on a new batch of New Wave/electropop drum-machine paced songs that would form the nucleus of their debut album. The effort dubbed Grow Up and Blow Away , revealed a more musically-layered and mature sound than the earlier Mainstream EP . Haines and Shaw completed the album in April 2001 and by this time had found a label for their release, Restless Records. The album was delayed for years by their record label. The band performed in New York in early Spring and late Summer 2001, personally circulating handmade CD-R copies of their unreleased music to fans at shows and by mail, eventually giving the music away for free on the internet. Metric at the time was for the most part a studio band and live shows approximated the synthesizer-centered and drum-machine driven sound of the recordings. In the same year they issued a 5-track EP entitled Static Anonymity and two promo singles: &quot;Grow Up and Blow Away&quot; and &quot;Raw Sugar&quot;. In the winter of 2001, Metric had gained two new bandmates: the drummer Joules Scott-Key (born in Flint, Michigan) and the bass player Joshua Winstead. Joules Scott-Key was attending college in Texas was in town with his friend Joshua Winstead performing in the local music scene. Scott-Key and Winstead had known each other for about a decade and they met Shaw and Haines at the Brooklyn loft and at local performances. On 2 September 2003, Metric released their first official studio album Old World Underground, Where Are You Now? on Last Gang Records. The album was received with positive reviews and it has gone gold in Canada. They released 2 singles from the album, &quot;Combat Baby&quot; and &quot;Dead Disco&quot;. On 27 September 2005, the band released their second studio album, Live It Out on Last Gang Records. The album was well received and has since gone twice platinum in Canada, selling over 200,000 units. They issued 4 singles: &quot;Monster Hospital&quot;, &quot;Poster of a Girl&quot;, and &quot;Empty&quot;. The band has toured the world extensively for several years. They also opened for The Rolling Stones in NYC. On 26 June 2007, Last Gang Records released Metric&#x27;s 2001 album Grow Up and Blow Away , after purchasing the rights to the album from band&#x27;s previous label. In 2007 they released a live EP entitled Live at Metropolis followed a year later by a DVD with the same name featuring a concert recorded from Montreal. On 7 April 2009, Metric released their fourth album Fantasies on their own label, Metric Music International. In the US it debuted at #1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top Heatseekers and peaked at #76 on the Billboard 200, in Canada it debuted at #13 on the Canadian Albums Chart and peaked at #6 and in Australia, the album debuted at #48. The album received mostly positive reviews and it&#x27;s their most successful record to date. They released 6 singles: &quot;Help I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, &quot;Front Row&quot;, &quot;Gimme Sympathy&quot;, &quot;Sick Muse&quot;, &quot;Gold Guns Girls&quot; and &quot;Stadium Love&quot;. Amazon. com listed Fantasies in eleventh in its &quot;Best Albums of 2009&quot; list. This album was a shortlisted nominee for the 2009 Polaris Music Prize and also won two Casby Awards, the NXNE favourite new indie release award and favourite new album award. On 18 April 2010, the album won the Juno Award for Alternative Album of the Year at the 2010 Awards, as well as the band winning Group of the Year. On 27 October 2009, Metric released a 5-track EP called Plug In Plug Out containing acoustic versions of five songs from Fantasies . During the 2010 Winter Olympics, Metric, along with several other Canadian music acts, came together in Vancouver to re-record K&#x27;Naan&#x27;s song &quot;Wavin&#x27; Flag&quot; to benefit Haiti in a movement called Young Artists for Haiti. In 2010, the band contributed to Twilight: Eclipse movie soundtrack with a song entitled &quot;Eclipse (All Yours)&quot;. In the same year, a previously unreleased song &quot;Black Sheep&quot; was used on the soundtrack of the movie Scott Pilgrim vs. the World. In 2011, Metric issued the live EP iTunes Session .

Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Underworld, Orbital, Apollo 440 and a few other less-known acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat electronic dance genre to the forefront of pop culture. They are known for their high-quality DJ sets, an example of which can be found on their album Brothers Gonna Work It Out . Many of their tracks have been in the UK charts as well as those in other countries. Wide belief is that their best album is &quot;Surrender&quot; however &quot;Dig Your Own Hole&quot; is considered their masterwork by a significant number of Chemical Brother connoisseurs and they are known for producing a style which evolves greatly between albums. Their song, Galvanize, was featured in Budweiser TV commercials in the U. S. giving it a great degree of exposure and popularity. They composed the original soundtrack for the feature film Hanna. Songfacts reports that &quot;Theme From Velodrome&quot; was one of five official tracks selected by the Olympic committee to soundtrack the London 2012 Games.

In 2013 he released his debut EP, featuring the hit single &quot;Take Me to Church&quot;, and his second EP &quot;From Eden&quot; in 2014. His debut studio album, &quot;Hozier&quot;, was released in Ireland in September 2014 and globally in October 2014. Hozier was born in Bray, County Wicklow, Ireland, the son of a musician. He began a degree in music at Trinity College, Dublin, but dropped out midway through his first year in order to record demos for Universal Music. While at Trinity, he became involved with the Trinity Orchestra. He was a member of Anuna from 2008 to 2012, and appears as a soloist on their 2012 release &quot;Illumination&quot; singing &quot;La Chanson de Mardi Gras&quot;. He toured and sang with the group internationally including performances in Norway and the Netherlands. In 2013, Hozier released the EP &quot;Take Me to Church EP&quot; (also containing &quot;Like Real People Do&quot;, &quot;Angel of Small Death and The Codeine Scene&quot; and a live version of &quot;Cherry Wine&quot;), with the title track becoming his breakthrough single after it went viral on YouTube.

", "Die Antwoord": "Die Antwoord (Afrikaans for &quot;The Answer&quot;) is a South African rap-rave duo formed in Cape Town in 2008. The groups rappers are Ninja and Yolandi Visser (often stylized as Y=o-landi Vi$$er) and DJ Hi-Tek. Their image involves a counterculture movement called zef and the influence of photographer Roger Ballen. They have released three studio albums; $O$ (2009), Ten$ion (2012) and Donker Mag (2014). ", "Aretha Franklin": "Aretha Franklin (March 25, 1942) is a Memphis, Tennessee-born but Detroit, Michigan-reared American iconic gospel, soul, and R&amp;B singer. Many have called her &quot;The Queen Of Soul&quot; and &quot;Lady Soul&quot;. She is renowned for her soul and R&amp;B recordings (on many, of which, she accompanies herself on keyboards and piano &ndash; a skill she learned at an early age, learning to play by ear, according to lifetime friend Smokey Robinson) but is also adept at jazz, rock, blues, pop, and gospel. She is generally regarded as one of the best vocalists ever by such industry publications/media outlets as Rolling Stone and VH1, due to her phenomenal technical and interpretative talents. Adept at the piano as well as having a gifted voice, Franklin became a child prodigy. By the age of fourteen, she signed a record deal with Battle Records, where her father Reverend C. L. Franklin recorded his sermons and gospel vocal recordings, and she issued Songs of Faith in 1956. She is the second most honored female popular singer in Grammy history (after Alison Krauss), having won eighteen competitive Grammys (including an unprecedented eleven for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance, eight of them consecutive). The state of Michigan has declared her voice to be a natural wonder. Franklin is perhaps best-known for her interpretation of Otis Redding&#x27;s Respect, recorded in 1967 with sisters Carolyn Franklin and Erma Franklin. Many of her songs, however, were originals that have since been covered by other artists. Some of her best-known compositions include (Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone, Ain&#x27;t No Way, All the King&#x27;s Horses, Baby, Baby, Baby, Call Me, Dr. Feelgood, Rock Steady, Spirit in the Dark, and Think (which she performed in the film The Blues Brothers ). ", "Between the Buried and Me": "Between the Buried and Me is a progressive metal band from Raleigh, North Carolina, comprised of former members of metalcore acts Prayer For Cleansing and Glass Casket. They have recorded seven albums in addition to a covers album and an EP. Their style is diverse, with influences ranging from thrash, death metal, jazz, math rock and melodic hardcore, to progressive or experimental artists such as Dream Theater, Mike Patton, King Crimson, Queen, and The Mars Volta. Members include vocalist/keyboardist and co-founder Tommy Giles Rogers, Jr. (Thomas Giles; ex-Prayer For Cleansing, Undying, From Here On); lead guitarist and co-founder Paul Waggoner (ex-Prayer For Cleansing, Undying); Glass Casket guitarist Dustie Waring and drummer Blake Richardson; and bassist Dan Briggs (Trioscapes, ORBS). Formed in 2000, the band signed to Victory Records in 2003, before catching the attention of Metal Blade Records and singing to that label in 2012. In late 2014, it was revealed that the band was writing material for their seventh original studio album, &quot;Coma Ecliptic,&quot; described on the band&#x27;s twitter as a &quot;rock opera. &quot; Recording began in early 2015 with long-time producer Jamie King, and it is scheduled to be released on Metal Blade records on July 7, 2015. The first single, &quot;Memory Palace&quot;, was made available in April. Former members include: guitarists Marc Duncan (ex-Prayer For Cleansing), Nick Fletcher (ex-Empire Falls, Azazel), and Shane Blay (Oh, Sleeper, Wovenwar; ex-Evelynn, Die Trying); bassists Jason King (ex-Azazel), and Kevin Falk (The Material, ex-Every Time I Die); and drummers Will Goodyear (Voids; ex-Prayer For Cleansing, Lobbyist), Jason Roe (ex-Evelynn, Mauled by a Cougar), and Mark Castillo (Emmure; ex-Crossfade, The Acacia Strain, Bury Your Dead, Hamartia).

The last lineup consisted of Thurston Moore (vocals, guitar), Kim Gordon (vocals, bass, guitar), Lee Ranaldo (vocals and guitar), Steve Shelley (drums) and Mark Ibold (bass). In their early career, Sonic Youth was associated with the No Wave art and music scene in New York City. Part of the first wave of American noise rock groups, the band carried out their interpretation of the hardcore punk ethos throughout the evolving American underground that focused more on the DIY ethic of the genre rather than its specific sound. As a result, Sonic Youth was pivotal in the rise of the alternative rock movement. Sonic Youth have expressed a wide variety of influences, ranging from the influential protopunk musician Patti Smith to composer John Cage. The band has been praised for having &quot;redefined what rock guitar could do&quot;, using a wide variety of unorthodox guitar tunings, and preparing guitars with objects like drumsticks and screwdrivers to alter the instruments&#x27; timbre. Formation and early history: 1977-1981 Sonic Youth&#x27;s history began when guitarist Thurston Moore moved to New York City in early 1976. Interested in punk, Moore joined the Coachmen, a guitar-based quartet, after arriving in the city. Lee Ranaldo, an art student at Binghamton University, became a fan of the Coachmen, and he and Moore were soon friends. Ranaldo was a member of Glenn Branca&#x27;s electric guitar ensemble, touring throughout the United States and Europe. After the breakup of the Coachmen, Moore began jamming with Stanton Miranda, whose band, CKM, featured local artist Kim Gordon. Moore and Gordon formed a band, appearing under names like Male Bonding and Red Milk before agreeing upon the Arcadians in late 1980. The band played their first show at Noise Fest in June 1981 at New York&#x27;s White Columns gallery. Branca&#x27;s ensemble played at the festival. Their performance impressed Moore, who described them as &quot;the most ferocious guitar band that I had ever seen in my life. &quot; After Branca&#x27;s set, Moore asked Ranaldo if he wanted to join the Arcadians. Ranaldo accepted; the band played three songs at the festival later in the week without a drummer. Each band member took turns playing the drums, until they met drummer Richard Edson. Moore soon renamed the band &quot;Sonic Youth&quot;. The name came from combining the nickname of MC5&#x27;s Fred &quot;Sonic&quot; Smith with the trend of reggae artists, such as Big Youth, featuring the word &quot;Youth&quot; in their names. Gordon later recalled that &quot;as soon as Thurston came up with the name Sonic Youth, a certain sound that was more of what we wanted to do came about. &quot; Early releases: 1982-1985 Branca signed Sonic Youth as the first act on his record label Neutral Records. In December 1981 the group recorded five songs in a studio in New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. The material was a released as the Sonic Youth mini-LP that, while largely ignored, was sent to a few key members of the US press that gave it uniformly favorable reviews. After their first record, Edson quit the group for a modestly successful acting career and was replaced by Bob Bert. During their early days as part of the New York music scene, Sonic Youth formed a friendship with noisy New Yorkers Swans. The bands came to share the same rehearsal space, and Sonic Youth embarked on its first tour, a two-week journey through the southern United States starting in November 1982, supporting Swans. During a second tour with Swans of the Midwest the following month, tensions ran high and Moore constantly criticized Bert&#x27;s drumming, which he felt wasn&#x27;t &quot;in the pocket&quot;. Bert was fired afterwards and replaced by Jim Sclavunos, who played drums on the band&#x27;s 1983 album Confusion Is Sex. Sonic Youth set up a two-week tour of Europe for the summer of 1983. Sclavunos, however, quit after only a few months. The group asked Bert to rejoin, and he agreed, on the condition that he would not be fired again after the tour&#x27;s conclusion. Sonic Youth found themselves well-received in Europe, but the New York press largely ignored the local noise rock scene. Eventually, as the press began to take notice of the genre, Sonic Youth was grouped along with bands like Big Black, the Butthole Surfers and Pussy Galore under the &quot;pigfuck&quot; label by Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau. (Christgau saw these bands as sharing an abrasive, noisy and confrontational aesthetic. ) Based on this classification, and on a negative live review by Christgau, a feud developed between Moore and the critic, with Moore renaming the song &quot;Kill Yr Idols&quot; to &quot;I Killed Christgau With My Big Fucking Dick&quot; before the two sorted out their differences amicably. During another tour of Europe in 1984, Sonic Youth&#x27;s disastrous London debut (where the band&#x27;s equipment malfunctioned and Moore consequently destroyed the equipment onstage in frustration) actually resulted in rave reviews in Sounds and the NME. By the time they returned to New York, they were so popular they played shows practically every week. That same year Moore and Gordon were married and Sonic Youth released Bad Moon Rising, a self-described &quot;Americana&quot; album that served as a reaction to the state of the nation at the time. The album, recorded by Martin Bisi, was built around transitional pieces that Moore and Ranaldo had come up with in order to take up time onstage while the other guitarist was busy tuning his instrument; as a result there are almost no breaks between the songs on the record, which feature walls of feedback and pounding rhythms. Bad Moon Rising featured an appearance by Lydia Lunch on the album&#x27;s single &quot;Death Valley &#x27;69&quot;, inspired by the Charles Manson Family murders. In contrast to their abrasive, atonal material of the time, the band considered the song relatively conventional. Due to a falling-out with Branca over disputed royalty payments from their Neutral releases, they were signed to Homestead Records by Gerard Cosloy and by Blast First in the UK (which founder Paul Smith created simply so he could distribute the band&#x27;s records in Europe). While even the New York press ignored Bad Moon Rising upon its release, now viewing the band as too arty and pretentious, Sonic Youth was becoming quite critically acclaimed in the United Kingdom, where the new album had sold 5,000 copies in just six months. Claiming he was bored with playing Bad Moon Rising live in its entirety for over a year, Bert quit the group and was replaced by Steve Shelley, formerly of the hardcore group Crucifucks. The band was so impressed with Shelley&#x27;s drumming after seeing him play live they hired him without an audition. Bert has remained on good terms with the group; he and Shelley both appeared in the music video for &quot;Death Valley &#x27;69&quot;, as Bert performed the drums on the song, but Shelley was the group&#x27;s drummer when the video was made. SST and Enigma: 1986-1989 Sonic Youth had a long fascination with influential indie label SST Records. Ranaldo said, &quot;It was the first record company we were on that we really would have given anything to be on. &quot; Sonic Youth eventually signed to the label in early 1986 and began recording Evol with Martin Bisi in March of that year. Evol itself represented an evolution of sorts for the band: in addition to increasingly melodic material and the impact of new drummer Shelley&#x27;s playing, the record also dealt with themes of celebrity, particularly with songs like &quot;Expressway To Yr Skull&quot; (called &quot;a classic&quot; by Neil Young) and &quot;Marilyn Moore&quot;. Signing to SST catapulted the band on to a national stage, something that did not happen to their peers in the New York underground. The mainstream music press subsequently began to take notice of the band. Robert Palmer of the The New York Times declared that Sonic Youth was &quot;making the most startlingly original guitar-based music since Jimi Hendrix&quot; and even People praised Evol as the &quot;aural equivalent of a toxic waste dump. &quot; Evol is also notable for a guest appearance by bass guitarist Mike Watt, a friend whom the band coaxed to come to New York after he was deeply depressed by the death of his bandmate, D. Boon. On 1987&#x27;s Sister, Sonic Youth continued refining their blend of pop song structures with uncompromising experimentalism. Another loose concept album, Sister is partly inspired by the life and works of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (the &quot;sister&quot; of the title was Dick&#x27;s fraternal twin, who died shortly after her birth, and whose memory haunted Dick his entire life). Sister sold 60,000 copies and received very positive reviews, becoming the first Sonic Youth album to crack the Top 20 of the Village Voice&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll. Despite the critical success, the band was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with SST due to concerns about payment and other administrative practices. Sonic Youth decided to release their next record on Enigma Records, which was distributed by Capitol Records and partly owned by EMI. The 1988 double LP Daydream Nation was a critical success that earned Sonic Youth substantial acclaim. The album came in second on the Village Voice Pazz &amp; Jop poll and topped the year-end album lists of the NME, CMJ, and Melody Maker. In 2006, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry. The lead single from the album, &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot;, was the first song from the band to reach significant success, receiving heavy airplay in modern and college rock stations. A number of prominent music periodicals including Rolling Stone hailed Daydream Nation as one of the best albums of the decade and named Sonic Youth as the &quot;Hot Band&quot; in its &quot;Hot&quot; issue. Unfortunately, distribution problems arose and Daydream Nation was often difficult to find in stores. Moore considered Enigma a &quot;cheap-jack Mafioso outfit&quot; and the band began looking for a major label deal. Major label career and alternative icons: 1990-1999 In 1990, Sonic Youth released Goo (their first album for Geffen), which featured the single &quot;Kool Thing&quot; on which Chuck D from rap group Public Enemy guested. &quot;Kool Thing&quot; became the song that many casual music fans associate with the band; it was later featured in the video game Guitar Hero III and was made available as a paid download for the Rock Band video game. The record is considered much more accessible than their previous work. Their 1991 tour with the then relatively unknown Nirvana was captured in the film 1991: The Year Punk Broke. In 1992, the band released Dirty on the DGC label. Their influence as tastemakers continued with their discovery of acclaimed skateboard video director Spike Jonze, who they recruited for the video for &quot;100%&quot;, which also featured skateboarder turned actor Jason Lee. This song, along with the Gordon tune &quot;JC&quot; contain lyrical references to the murder of Joe Cole, a friend who worked with the band as a roadie. The album features artwork by Los Angeles-based artist Mike Kelley. In addition, Robert Bradley&#x27;s Blackwater Surprise opened on numerous occasions for Sonic Youth in the late 90s. &quot;Dirty&quot; features a guest appearance by Ian McKaye (Minor Threat and Fugazi) playing guitar on the track &quot;Youth Against Fascism&quot;. In 1994 the band released Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star, their best charting release in the United States, which peaked at #34 on the Billboard 200. The album was filled with low-key melodies and even produced a hit single, &quot;Bull in the Heather&quot;. Moore and Gordon&#x27;s daughter, Coco Hayley Gordon Moore was born earlier in the year, and many of the songs from the album were never played live because there was never a full tour to support the album due to Gordon&#x27;s pregnancy. The band headlined the 1995 Lollapalooza festival. By that time, alternative rock had gained considerable mainstream attention, and the festival was parodied on The Simpsons 1996 episode &quot;Homerpalooza&quot;, which featured voiceovers from the band. They also performed the final credits theme for that episode. Gordon collaborated in Free Kitten, and started a clothing label X-Girl, based in Los Angeles. Ranaldo and Moore have played with many experimental / noise musicians, including William Hooker, Nels Cline, Tom Surgal, Don Dietrich, Christian Marclay and Mission of Burma, among others. Shelley runs the Smells Like Records record label, as well as playing in backing bands for Chan Marshall (Cat Power) and Two Dollar Guitar. From Sonic Youth&#x27;s earliest days, Gordon had occasionally played guitar with the group. About the time of A Thousand Leaves and Washing Machine she began playing guitar more frequently, resulting in a three-guitar and drums lineup. These songs were something of a shift for the group&#x27;s sound, and would lead to the introduction of a fifth member a few years later. The Washing Machine album started a major shift in the band, away from their punk roots, that working with longer noise-jam sections and included two tracks that showed the new approach in full force - the title track &quot;Washing Machine&quot;, which is just under 10 minutes long, and &quot;The Diamond Sea&quot;, which is over 19 minutes long. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, the band began releasing a series of highly experimental records on their own Hoboken, New Jersey-based label SYR. The music was mostly instrumental, and the album and track titles and even the liner notes and credits were in different languages: SYR1 was in French, SYR2 in Dutch, SYR3 in Esperanto, SYR5 in Japanese, SYR6 in Lithuanian, SYR7 in Arpitan, and SYR8 in Danish. SYR3 was the first to feature Jim O&#x27;Rourke, who went on to become an official band member. SYR4 was subtitled &quot;Goodbye, 20th Century&quot; and featured works by avant-garde classical composers such as John Cage, Yoko Ono, Steve Reich, and Christian Wolff played by Sonic Youth along with several collaborators from the modern avant-garde music scene, such as Christian Marclay, William Winant, Wharton Tiers, Takehisa Kosugi and others. The album received mixed reviews, but some critics praised the group&#x27;s efforts at popularizing and reinterpreting the composers&#x27; works. Later DGC period: 2000-2006 On July 4, 1999, Sonic Youth&#x27;s instruments, amps, and gear were stolen in the middle of the night while on tour in Orange, California (see initial post on Usenet). Forced to start from scratch with new instruments, they recorded NYC Ghosts &amp; Flowers and opened for Pearl Jam during the east coast leg of their 2000 tour. In 2001 Sonic Youth collaborated with French avant-garde singer and poet Brigitte Fontaine in Fontaine&#x27;s album &quot;Kekeland&quot;. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, several members of the band were blocks away, Jim at their NYC studio (Echo Canyon on Murray Street), and Ranaldo and his wife Leah nearby at home. After the attacks, they curated the first U. S. outing of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties music festival in L. A. The festival was originally scheduled for October 2001, but it was delayed until March the following year due to the attacks. In the summer of 2002, Murray Street was released; many critics heralded a &quot;return to form for SY&quot;, seemingly revitalized by the addition of Jim O&#x27;Rourke, who became a full member during this period, playing bass guitar, guitar, and occasionally synthesizer. This was followed in 2004 by the release of Sonic Nurse, an album similar in sound and approach to its immediate predecessor that also received positive reviews. &quot;Pattern Recognition&quot;, a song named after the 2003 William Gibson novel, finds the band once again using Gibson&#x27;s work for inspiration. The band also showed their pop culture commentary and sense of humor with the track &quot;Mariah Carey and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream&quot;, a faster-tempo song sung by Gordon, which spoofed Carey&#x27;s life, including her short-lived relationship with rapper Eminem, which originally appeared on a 2003 split 7&quot; with Erase Errata (on the album cover, the reference to &quot;Mariah Carey&quot; in the title was replaced by &quot;Kim Gordon&quot; due to potential copyright issues. Sonic Nurse had decent sales, in part due to performances on TV talk shows including Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. The band was also slated to perform in 2004&#x27;s Lollapalooza tour along with acts such as The Pixies and The Flaming Lips, but the concert was canceled due to lackluster ticket sales. When the band toured later that year, they played extensively from their 1980s catalog. On October 6, 2005, Los Angeles CityBeat reported that some of the gear stolen in 1999 was surprisingly recovered and that it might be used for recording of the next album, then tentatively titled Sonic Life. The report also said that Jim O&#x27;Rourke might be leaving the band soon; his departure was confirmed by Lee Ranaldo in an interview to Pitchfork Media. In May 2006, the group announced on their website that ex-Pavement member Mark Ibold would play bass for the band on their upcoming tour. Rather Ripped was released in Europe on June 5, 2006 and in the USA on June 13, 2006. Compared to previous Sonic Youth recordings, the album features many short, conventionally structured, melodic songs and fewer feedback-fuelled left field improvisations (the band&#x27;s avant-garde tendencies nowadays have been largely exorcised through SYR releases and solo outings rather than band albums). Later that summer, Sonic Youth played the 2006 Bonnaroo Festival, as well as Lollapalooza, promoting the album. In December, Rolling Stone made it their number three Album of the Year 2006. The band released The Destroyed Room: B-Sides and Rarities in December 2006. It features tracks previously available only on vinyl, limited-release compilations, b-sides to international singles, and some material that had never before been released. This marked the band&#x27;s final Geffen release. Independent agents and signing to Matador: 2007-present In 2008 the band independently re-released Master-Dik for the first time on CD in March exclusively at their online store. They also released two more editions to the SYR, SYR7: J&#x27;Accuse Ted Hughes, and SYR8: Andre Sider Af Sonic Youth. SYR7 was released on April 22, and SYR8 was released July 28. On June 10, they also released a compilation album on Starbucks Music, called Hits Are for Squares. The first 15 tracks were selected by other celebrities, and track 16, &quot;Slow Revolution&quot;, is a new recording by Sonic Youth. Also in June, the band was the subject of an intensively researched biography, Goodbye 20th Century: A Biography of Sonic Youth written by music journalist David Browne. The book was cited as &quot;compelling&quot; (Salon), &quot;compulsively readable&quot; (Publishers Weekly), and &quot;an expressway to the soul of the influential band&quot; (Vanity Fair). The book featured new interviews with the band as well as nearly 100 friends, family members, and peers. It was published by Da Capo and included over 60 rare photos. On August 30 2008, the band premiered two new songs at the final McCarren Park Pool show. Thurston Moore stated that in November 2008 the band will start recording a new studio album. The band did not continue their contract with Geffen, being discontent at the way Geffen handled their last four or five albums. On September 8, 2008, it was confirmed by Matador&#x27;s Matablog that Sonic Youth will release its sixteenth album (titled The Eternal) in spring, 2009, on Matador Records. In December 2008 it was also announced that the group had recently collaborated with John Paul Jones (of Led Zeppelin fame) on a piece that served as the soundtrack for a new Merce Cunningham Dance Company piece. This work was performed by the company on April 16-19, 2009, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in celebration of Cunningham&#x27;s 90th birthday. On February 12, the band revealed the cover art for The Eternal via their website and blog. The album, produced by John Agnello, was released on June 9, 2009. With the release Matador Records also offered an exclusive live LP only available to those who preordered the album. On October 14, 2011, Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore announced that they separated after 27 years of marriage through a statement by Matador. The announcement has raised doubts over the future of Sonic Youth after Matador revealed that plans for the band remained &quot;uncertain,&quot; despite the fact the band had previously hinted they would record new material later in the year In a interview on November 28, 2011, Lee Ranaldo said that Sonic Youth are &quot;ending for a while&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m feeling optimistic about the future no matter what happens at this point,&quot; Ranaldo said. &quot;It was a pretty good tour overall. I mean, there was a little bit of tiptoeing around and some different situations with the travelling - you know, they&#x27;re not sharing a room any more or anything like that . . . It remains to be seen at this point what happens. I think they are certainly the last shows for a while and I guess I&#x27;d just leave it at that. &quot; Ranaldo also suggest there are no plans for Sonic Youth to record new material. &quot;There&#x27;s tons and tons of archival projects and things like that still going on,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m just happy right now to let the future take its course. &quot; Musical style and influences : Alternative tunings Sonic Youth&#x27;s sound relies heavily on the use of alternative tunings. Scordatura on stringed instruments has been used for centuries and alternative guitar tunings had been used for decades in blues music, and to a limited degree in rock music (such as with Lou Reed&#x27;s Ostrich guitar on The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico), but Sonic Youth began using a variety of tunings more radical than nearly anything in rock music history. The tunings were painstakingly developed by Moore and Ranaldo during the band&#x27;s rehearsals; Moore once reported that the odd tunings were an attempt to introduce new sounds: &quot;When you&#x27;re playing in standard tuning all the time &#8230; things sound pretty standard. &quot; Rather than re-tune for every song, Sonic Youth generally use a particular guitar for one or two songs, and can take dozens of instruments on tour. This can be the source of much trouble for the band, as some songs rely on specific guitars that have been uniquely prepared. Influences Besides Branca, French avant-gardist Brigitte Fontaine, Patti Smith, Public Image Ltd (PiL) and The Stooges, another influence was 1980s-era hardcore punk; after seeing Minor Threat perform in May 1982, Moore declared them &quot;the greatest live band I have ever seen&quot;. While recognizing that their own music was very different from hardcore, Moore and Gordon, especially, were impressed by hardcore&#x27;s speed and intensity, and by the nationwide network of musicians and fans. &quot;It was great,&quot; said Moore, &quot;the whole thing with slam dancing and stage diving, that was far more exciting than pogoing and spitting&#8230;. I thought hardcore was very musical and very radical. &quot; Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo have expressed on numerous occasions their admiration for the music of Joni Mitchell, such as this quote by Thurston Moore: &quot;Joni Mitchell! I've used elements of her songwriting and guitar playing, and no one would ever know about it. &quot; Additionally, Joni Mitchell has always used a number of alternative tunings, as does Sonic Youth. The band named a song after her, &quot;Hey Joni. &quot; Members of the band have also maintained relationships with other avant-garde artists from other genres and even other media, drawing influence from the work of John Cage and Henry Cowell. For a 1988 Peel Session, Sonic Youth covered three songs by The Fall and &quot;Victoria&quot; by The Kinks, also covered by The Fall. Sonic Youth has featured album art by several well-known avant-garde visual artists, such as Mike Kelley and Gerhard Richter, whose paintings from his &quot;Candles&quot; series was used as artwork on Daydream Nation. Members : Thurston Moore - guitar, bass guitar, vocal; Lee Ranaldo - guitar, vocal; Kim Gordon - bass guitar, guitar, vocal; Mark Ibold - bass guitar; Steve Shelley - drums. Former members : Anne DeMarinis - keyboards; Jim O&#x27;Rourke - guitar, bass guitar; Bob Bert - drums; Richard Edson - drums; Jim Sclavunos - drums. ", "The Killers": "There are at least five artists which use, or have used, this name: 1) an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001 2) a Uruguayan rock band from the early 1970s 3) an American hardcore band from Chicago, IL, from the 1990s 4) an American band from Cleveland, Ohio, from the 1980s 5) a British punk rock band from the 1970s 6) An American doo wop group from the 1950s 1. The Killers is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, formed in 2001 and consist of Brandon Flowers (vocals, keyboards), Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion). The band&#x27;s four studio albums to date have sold in excess of 18 million copies worldwide combined. The band got its name from the fictional band &quot;The Killers&quot; in the video for New Order&#x27;s &quot;Crystal&quot;. The band was on hiatus, but returned to the studio to record their 4th studio album in early 2011. Songfacts reports that &quot;Runaways&quot;, the first single from &quot;Battle Born&quot;, was released on July 10, 2012. Initially, The Killers played at large clubs in Las Vegas. With the band&#x27;s line-up stable and their repertoire of songs expanding, the band began to attract attention from talent bookers, local agents, major label, scouts -- and a UK representative for Warner Bros. Though the Warner Bros representative passed on the band, he took the demo back with him, showing it to a friend who worked at UK (London-based) indie label Lizard King Records (now Marrakesh Records). The Killers then signed in the summer of 2002 to a British label. They released their debut album &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; on June 2004 in the United Kingdom and US (on Island Records). Their first single was &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;. The band also had chart success with their singles &quot;Mr. Brightside,&quot; which reached the Top 10 in the UK when released, and &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot;. The band started recording its second album, &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; on February 15, 2006, at The Palms Hotel/Casino in Las Vegas. It was released on October 2006. Lead singer, Brandon Flowers said that Sam&#x27;s Town is &quot;one of the best albums of the past 20 years&quot;. Though the album has received a mixed response from critics and fans, it has still remained popular and sold over 4 million copies worldwide. The first single, &quot;When You Were Young&quot; debuted on radio stations in late July 2006. In late August 2006, it was offered as a downloadable track before the album&#x27;s debut. The single then entered the chart on downloads alone at #5, and the following week on its official release went to #2 in the UK. The video clip of the second single, &quot;Bones&quot;, was directed by Tim Burton. The third single was &quot;Read My Mind&quot;. The video was filmed in Tokyo, Japan. The last one was &quot;For Reasons Unknown&quot; released in June, 2007. The album sold over 700,000 copies worldwide in the first week of release, with a No. 2 debut on the United World chart. Brandon Flowers announced on August 22, 2007, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, at the T Vital Festival, that it would be the last time that the album &quot;Sam&#x27;s Town&quot; would be played in Europe. The Killers played their last Sam&#x27;s Town concert in Melbourne, Australia on November, 2007. Much of The Killers&#x27; music is based on British influences and on the music of the 1980s, particularly New Wave. Flowers has also said in interviews that the larger-than-life sound of many of the band&#x27;s songs is due to the influence of living in Las Vegas, a city where everything is about flash and who can top whom. They appreciate post-punk bands that sprang up during the 80&#x27;s such as Joy Division, and they are also avowed fans of New Order (with whom Flowers has performed live), Pet Shop Boys, Dire Straits, David Bowie, The Smiths, Morrissey, Depeche Mode, U2, Queen, Oasis and The Beatles. Their second album was said to be greatly influenced by Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s music and lyrics. The compilation album called &quot;Sawdust&quot;, containing B-sides, rarities, and some new material, was released on November 12, 2007. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Tranquilize,&quot; a collaboration with Lou Reed, was released on October 2007. The band also released their cover of Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Shadowplay&quot; on the U. S. iTunes Store. The album also contains the songs &quot;Ruby, Don&#x27;t Take Your Love to Town&quot; (a The First Edition cover), &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (a Dire Straits cover), and a new version of &quot;Move Away&quot; (previously available on the Spider-Man 3 soundtrack). One of the tracks on Sawdust is &quot;Leave the Bourbon On The Shelf&quot; the first but previously unreleased part of the so called &quot;Murder Trilogy,&quot; in which it is followed by &quot;Midnight Show&quot; then &quot;Jenny Was a Friend of Mine&quot; The Cowboys&#x27; Christmas Ball Songfacts reports that The Killers are recognized for their work with Bono&#x27;s Product Red campaign, which is dedicated to fighting AIDS in Africa. In 2006 they released their first Christmas themed song and music video, &quot;A Great Big Sled&quot; in aid of the charity,followed by &quot;Don&#x27;t Shoot Me Santa&quot; on December 1, 2007. Their festive tunes have subsequently became an annual event and &quot;The Cowboy&#x27;s Christmas Ball&quot; was released as their sixth successive release intended to raise money for the Product Red campaign on December 1, 2011. &quot;Day and Age&quot; was the title of The Killers third studio album. The title was confirmed in an NME video interview at Reading and Leeds Festival with lead singer Brandon Flowers. The band headed to the studio in June and the album is being produced by Stuart Price. In the October 2008 edition of German magazine Musikexpress, in an article dated August 15, 2008, Keuning says the new record was 99% finished. The Killers selected Paul Normansell to do the artwork for the new album, which should include some of Normansell&#x27;s artwork and portraits of the band themselves. Flowers also stated in an interview with Q that he was excited to play a new song called &quot;Tidal Wave&quot;, influenced by David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Drive-In Saturday&quot; and &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; by Roy Orbison. The setlist of The Killers&#x27; July 29 and August 1, 2008 show at New York City&#x27;s Highline Ballroom and Atlantic City&#x27;s Borgata Hotel and Spa contained two new songs: Spaceman and Neon Tiger. These songs were also played at The Killers&#x27; show on July 31st at the MGM Grand at Foxwoods Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Spaceman and Neon Tiger are also included on &quot;Day and Age&quot;. During their brief summer tour in 2008, The Killers confirmed several other potential song titles for &quot;Day and Age&quot; including &quot;Goodnight, Travel Well&quot;, &quot;Vibration&quot;, &quot;Joy Ride&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stay&quot;, &quot;Losing Touch&quot;, &quot;Fairytale Dustland&quot; and &quot;Human&quot;, although &quot;Vibration&quot; wasn&#x27;t included. The Killers&#x27; third studio album &quot;Day and Age&quot; (which was reviewed at http://www. silentsoundwaves. com/album-reviews/the-killers-day-age-review/ ) was released on 25th November 2008 (24th November for the UK). The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Human&quot; was debuted on 22nd September and on the 30th September, the single was made available on iTunes, with many radio DJ&#x27;s suggesting it was the best single by The Killers yet. Killers frontman Brandon Flowers recently (December 2008) has said that he thinks his band will be bigger than U2 eventually, and sooner than you might think. He told The Daily Telegraph that &quot;U2 are unbelievable, but they&#x27;re getting old. It feels like it&#x27;s time&quot;. The Killers&#x27; fourth studio album, Battle Born, was released 18 September 2012. It took 15 months to record. The band began recording it after they took a touring break for a little over a year. The album has five producers, with The Killers producing one song by themselves, &quot;The Rising Tide. &quot; The debut single was &quot;Runaways,&quot; followed by &quot;Miss Atomic Bomb,&quot; &quot;Here with Me,&quot; and &quot;The Way it Was. &quot; www. thekillersmusic. com 2) The Killers was a Uruguayan rock band from the early 1970s which realeased one album in 1972. 3) The Killers was an American hardcore band from Chicago, IL, from the 1990s founded by former members of Charles Bronson. They released records on Hater of God and Gloom, and had split records with A. P. B. &amp; 9 Shocks Terror. Reminds of Behead The Prophet No Lord Shall Live meets The Oath. 4) The Killers (aka Insanity and The Killers) was an American band from Cleveland, Ohio. They released one 7'' on Huh? Oh? in 1981. 5) The Killers was a British punk rock band from England formed in 1977 (though released their first 7&quot;, &quot;I Don&#x27;t Care&quot;, as Joe Cool &amp; The Killers). In 1978 they released their one and only album called &quot;Killer&quot;; by then they had dropped the Joe Cool and released this record under the name &quot;The Killers&quot;. ", "Elton John": "Sir Elton Hercules John, CBE (born Reginald Kenneth Dwight in Pinner, Middlesex, England on 25 March 1947) is an immensely popular English singer, composer (mostly with lyricist Bernie Taupin) and pianist. In a career spanning five decades, Elton John has sold over 250 million records and has over fifty Top 40 hits, making him one of the most successful musicians of all time. His 1997 tribute to Diana, Princess of Wales, &quot; Candle In The Wind 1997,&quot; remains the world&#x27;s biggest selling and fastest selling single of all time. In 1964, Dwight and his friends formed a band called Bluesology. By day, he ran errands for a music publishing company; he divided his nights between solo gigs at a London hotel bar and working with Bluesology. By the mid-1960s, Bluesology was backing touring American soul and R&amp;B musicians like The Isley Brothers, Major Lance, Billy Stewart, Doris Troy and Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles. In 1966, the band became musician Long John Baldry&#x27;s supporting band and played 16 times at The Marquee Club. John was one of the dominant commercial forces in the rock world during the 1970s, with a string of seven consecutive #1 records on the U. S. album charts, twenty-three Top 40 singles, sixty Top 10 hits, and six #1 hits. His success had a profound impact on popular music, and contributed to the continued popularity of the piano in rock and roll. Key musical elements in John&#x27;s success included his melodic gifts matched with the contributions of his lyricist partner Bernie Taupin, his rich tenor and gospel-chorded piano, aggressive string arrangements, his flamboyant fashion sense and on-stage showmanship. As told by himself, his somewhat &quot;flashy&quot; outfits were due to the fact that he sits behind the piano and would otherwise vanish on stage. John was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and knighted in 1998. He has helped lead the fight against AIDS since the late 1980s. In 2004, Rolling Stone Magazine ranked John #49 on their list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. He continues to be a major public figure. ", "Hanson": "There are at least two artists which have used the name Hanson 1. A pop rock group from Oklahoma, United States 2. A funk rock group from the United Kingdom active in the 1970&#x27;s. 1. Hanson is an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma. The band consists of guitarist and vocalist Isaac Hanson, pianist and vocalist Taylor Hanson, and drummer and vocalist Zac Hanson. Their work has spanned many different genres, including rock, blues, folk, and pop. They are most noted for their Grammy-nominated 1997 hit single, \"MMMBop. \" Their 1997 album Middle of Nowhere (the band's third recorded album and first major studio album, also nominated for a Grammy) was met with critical acclaim and went on to achieve multi-platinum status. The group's subsequent major effort, This Time Around showcased the brothers' considerable talent and artistic growth, receiving wide critical acclaim for its bluesy/classic-rock and soulful pop harmonies. The album failed to repeat the commercial success of Middle of Nowhere however, only achieving gold status. The album has since been considered a trend-setter and precursor for such acts as Michelle Branch, John Mayer, Avril Lavigne, Paramore, Vanessa Carlton and Eisley. After many promotional and artistic conflicts with Island/Def Jam, Hanson split from the label in 2003 and started their own label, 3CG Records. In 2004, they released their third major studio album, Underneath, independently. The album reached #1 on Billboard's Independent Album Chart and has since been noted as one of the biggest-selling independent albums of all time. The single \"Penny &amp; Me\" reached #2 on Billboard's Top 200. Like This Time Around, Underneath was well-received and well-reviewed for its more mature classic rock/pop sound. The band continues to have a dedicated fan base and Internet presence, and recently completed a tour of college campuses, showing a documentary, Strong Enough to Break, made about their struggle to form their own label and release Underneath. The documentary http://www. last. fm/music/Hanson was also shown at the Hollywood Film Festival in October 2006. A live album (The Best of Hanson; Live &amp; Electric), recorded in Melbourne on the Australian leg of the \"Underneath: Live &amp; Electric\" tour was released in October 2005. The band released of their fourth major studio album, The Walk in North America on July 24th, 2007. They have released a second documentary, titled Taking The Walk as a continuation of their struggles and successes of writing, recording and producing their own album. After spending some time in Africa, Hanson released a single \"Great Divide\" for World AIDS Day, with 100% of the download proceeds going to the Perinatal HIV Unit at Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, South Africa. During the making of The Walk, Hanson made a trip to Africa to record some tracks with the African Children&#x27;s Choir. They were so inspired by their experiences there that they have since teamed up with TOMS Shoes&ndash;a california-based company who donates a pair of shoes for each pair sold to a child in poverty who does not have shoes. In order to raise awareness for this charity and the daily things we take for granted, as well as small and impactful ways to help those in need, Hanson organizes one mile barefoot walks before each of their shows. As of 10/30/08 they have walked a total of 100 miles together with their fans. They are donating $1 for each person who walks with them to one of 5 causes to help children and monthers in Africa battling AIDS and poverty. The fans are invited to organize their own walks and Hanson will also donate a dollar to whatever cause they are walking for. The goal is to Walk around the World and as of 2/4/2009 have walked 19,236 miles and have 5,666 to go. More information is available at www. takethewalk. net Hanson released their 5th studio album entitled &quot;Shout It Out&quot; on June 8, 2010. Leading up to this release they performed all of their albums at 5 sold out shows at the Gramercy Theater in New York City. 2. Hanson is a funk rock band formed in 1973 by reggae musician Junior Marvin. The group released two albums - &quot;Now Hear This&quot; (1973) and &quot;Magic Dragon&quot; (1974) before disbanding in 1974. ", "Ben Howard": "Ben Howard (born 24 April 1987) is an English singer-songwriter, born in London. He moved to Totnes, Devon, in his teens. Howard&#x27;s musically-inclined parents exposed him at a young age to their favourite records from singer-songwriter artists such as Bob Dylan, Nina Simone and John Martyn. Howard began writing his own songs and after a short spell studying journalism, he decided in 2009 at the age of 21 to become a full-time musician. After building up a reputation with his gigs across the UK, Howard was eventually asked to sign to Island Records. His first album, Every Kingdom, was released on October 3, 2011 and debuted at #7 on the UK album chart. It sold in excess of 1 million copies globally, received a Mercury Music Prize nomination, and was the catalyst for Ben picking up two Brit Awards in 2012 for British Breakthrough and British Solo Male Artist. The follow up, &#x27;I Forget Where We Were&#x27; was released on 20th October 2014 through Island Records. It was produced by Ben and his drummer Chris Bond at Start Point Farm Studios in Devon.  www. benhowardmusic. co. uk . ", "Bonobo": "Simon Green AKA Bonobo&#x27;s first album - 2000&#x27;s &#x27;Animal Magic&#x27; - was released via Tru Thoughts before being picked up by Ninja Tune. It announced him as a serious talent; able to bring a musician&#x27;s edge to electronic music, with all the freedom that skill allowed. His subsequent albums for Ninja, Dial M for Monkey and Days to Come, developed his sensibility, won him fans across the globe, and saw him develop his live show into a mesmeric re-working of his records. He has also worked hard as a DJ, a part of Green&#x27;s arsenal that perhaps truly came into its own at the same time as 2010's Black Sands. 2012 saw him take the uptempo, club re-edits of Black Sands from a seminal Boiler Room performance in London to dance floors across the world, and unveil a new light show that further enhanced the impact of these stunning songs. A remix album was released featuring reworkings by fans and peers such as Machinedrum, Floating Points, Mark Pitchard, Lapalux and Falty DL. Later the same year, he finally settled down in his New York studio to write his fifth album. The North Borders was another long stride forward - both a natural evolution and a continuation of the electronic palette of Black Sands. With vocal features from Erykah Badu, as well as Grey Reverend (Cinematic Orchestra) and Cornelia (Portico Quartet) it&#x27;s another finely balanced body of work. Bonobo has a long history of unearthing new talent (Andreya Triana, Bajka) and The North Borders saw him do so once again. The vocals of new collaborator Szjerdene are sprinkled across the album. Since the album's release, Green has gone on to play over 175 shows across three continents and 30 countries, wowing audiences with the hypnotic, extended live versions of his songs. He performed sold out shows at The Sydney Opera House and Brixton Academy, and his very own, day long festival at London's Roundhouse. 2014 saw him and his band play the iconic Coachella festival, Sonar, Glastonbury and many more. This period of extensive touring came to a breathtaking close with his largest show to date at London's Alexandra Palace in November. In celebration, Ninja Tune released 'The North Borders Tour. - Live' in October. A deluxe release including a live album, hardback book and a DVD of seminal live performances from a truly memorable tour. ", "Travi$ Scott": "Jacques Webster, better known by his stage name Travi$ Scott, is an American hip hop recording artist, record producer and model from Houston, Texas. In 2012, Scott signed to Epic Records before eventually signing to Kanye West&#x27;s G. O. O. D Music production wing known as Very G. O. O. D. Beats, in November of the same year, as an in-house producer, after appearing on the label&#x27;s debut compilation Cruel Summer (2012). In April 2013, it was announced he signed with T. I. &#x27;s Grand Hustle imprint. He released his first official full-length project, a mixtape titled &#x27;Owl Pharaoh&#x27;, on May 21, 2013. On August 18, 2014 Scott released a free-album/mixtape entitled &#x27;Days Before Rodeo&#x27;. His debut studio album, Rodeo, is due to be released on September 4th. ", "Richard Hawley": "Richard Hawley (born Richard Willis Hawley, 17 January 1967, Sheffield, United Kingdom) is a critically-acclaimed guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. Hawley initially found success as a member of Britpop band Longpigs in the 1990&#x27;s, and formerly Treebound Story. When a drug-filled torpor after an extensive tour of America brought the band to the brink of extinction in 1997, Hawley was asked to play with Pulp by his close friend and Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker. &quot;They saved my life,&quot; Hawley later recalled, &quot;I was going mental with drink and drugs. &quot; The subsequent world tour in support of Pulp&#x27;s album This Is Hardcore left Hawley emotionally and physically drained on his return to his home city. During this time, he even considered leaving the music industry altogether. It was an encounter at Hawley&#x27;s Sheffield home that led the longtime collaborator out of the shadows. Impressed by a home demo of his songs, both Pulp&#x27;s Jarvis Cocker and Steve Mackey urged Hawley to head into the studio and begin work on his first solo release. 2000&#x27;s eponymous mini album encouraged Hawley to return to the studio once more. In 2001 Late Night Final , named after the cry of vendors selling the Sheffield Star evening newspaper on the streets of the city, was released to positive reviews from the press, if unspectacular sales. Two years later Hawley released Lowedges , another Sheffield reference, this time to the curiously named suburb of the city that had so entranced the young Hawley when he had seen it on the destination board of a bus. NME called Lowedges the &quot;first great album of 2003&quot; and it topped an end of year poll held by Virgin Radio. In 2004 Hawley signed to Mute Records, a division of the giant EMI. Legal wrangling delayed Cole&#x27;s Corner , Hawley&#x27;s fourth release, until September 2005. Again Hawley mines the theme of his beloved home city, this time referencing the location where courting lovers meet. Cole&#x27;s Corner eventually gained a nomination for the acclaimed Mercury Prize in 2006. Hawley&#x27;s work as a session musician and producer remains in high demand. After contributing towards her eponymous 2004 release , Hawley also supported Nancy Sinatra on her European tour in 2005. In the past, Hawley has also worked with artists as diverse as New York&#x27;s A Girl Called Eddy, All Saints (he played the guitar solo on their cover of &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;), Nellee Hooper&#x27;s soundtrack for Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet and with Jarvis Cocker&#x27;s Relaxed Muscle project. Aside from his solo and session work, Hawley occasionally tours with The Feral Cats, a side project that enables him to explore his interest in rockabilly music. Possibly due to his aforementioned rockabilly interest, Hawley once auditioned for the role as guitarist in the rockabilly-inclined Morrissey&#x27;s band. Fiercely proud of his working class upbringing, Hawley recently described himself as &quot;jurassic labour&quot; in response to a question about the New Labour project. He lives in Sheffield, with his wife and children and is an avid Sheffield Wednesday supporter. In 2007 Hawley released a new studio album, Lady&#x27;s Bridge (the title refers to a bridge Hawley regulary crosses in his native Sheffield) again to much critical acclaim. Hawley&#x27;s album Truelove&#x27;s Gutter was released in September 2009 and followed that October by a UK nationwide tour. The album was nominated for, and won the Mojo record of the year. Following the success of his award-winning, hugely acclaimed 2009 album &#x27;Truelove&#x27;s Gutter&#x27;, Richard Hawley will release his sixth studio album, &#x27;Standing At The Sky&#x27;s Edge&#x27; - his first for new label Parlophone - on 7th May. Recorded at Sheffield&#x27;s Yellow Arch Studio in 2011, &#x27;Standing At The Sky&#x27;s Edge&#x27; marks a seismic shift in direction for Hawley. The album is a euphoric, sonic assault on the senses, channelling elements of psychedelia, space rock and ragas with heavy riffs and raw, visceral guitar solos - as well as more familiar, tender moments - which will surprise Hawley&#x27;s fans and peers alike. www. richardhawley. co. uk", "Parkway Drive": "Parkway Drive is an Australian metalcore band. The band formed in the summer of 2003, their name coming from the street they used to practice on in their home town of Byron Bay, Australia. Not long after they had formed, they released a split EP with Adelaide band I Killed The Prom Queen. Later that year, the band also made an appearance on the Byron Bay Hardcore compilation What We&#x27;ve Built, preceded by their debut EP, Don&#x27;t Close Your Eyes. In May 2005 the PwD headed to the USA to record their debut album with renowned metal producer, Killswitch Engage guitarist Adam Dutkiewicz (who is responsible for acclaimed releases from the likes of Unearth, August Burns Red, Underoath and Johnny Truant. ) Since the release of Don&#x27;t Close Your Eyes, Parkway Drive have rapidly accumulated a loyal fanbase Australia-wide, courtesy of support slots for international acts including Hatebreed, In Flames, Chimaira, Shadows Fall, As I Lay Dying, Bleeding Through, Alexisonfire, and performances at Metal for The Brain 2005 and Australia&#x27;s Hardcore 2005. They have built quite a strong reputation within the music industry, this led to their signing with Epitaph record label. In June 2006 they released Killing With a Smile in the United States during August of that year. In late May 2006, second bass player Shaun Cash left the band for personal reasons with the full support of the rest of the members. The band soon found a replacement in their &quot;merch guy&quot; and long-time friend, Jia &quot;Pie&quot; O&#x27;Connor. Now a permanent part of the line-up, he played with them for the rest of their first international tour in the United Kingdom, and Europe, and later dates in the United States. In October 2006, they were billed as the Australian contingent on the Rockstar Taste of Chaos tour, playing alongside Anti-Flag, Underoath, Thursday, Senses Fail, Taking Back Sunday and Saosin. During November and December 2006, they appeared at the Homebake Festival, Sound Fest, Resist Records&#x27; tour, Soundwave Festival and Gravity G Festival before returning to the UK and Europe. On 3 March 2007, a new song was previewed to a crowd at Underworld entitled &quot;The Siren&#x27;s Song&quot;. The song would later feature on Horizons. They were placed on the bill for the U. S. Vans Warped Tour 2007 as the only Australian band on the tour. On 15 August, Winston McCall appeared in an interview on the short. fast. loud show on Australia&#x27;s Triple J Radio station in which he previewed a track off Horizons entitled &quot;Boneyards&quot;. Horizons was released on 6 October 2007. The album was generally acclaimed by critics and fans alike; especially Blunt Magazine, who wrote that the album &#x27;simply slays from the get go&#x27; and awarded it 10/10, and planet-loud. com, which suggested that it would &#x27;set the benchmark for metal albums to come&#x27;. It debuted at number 6 on the ARIA Charts. After the release of Horizons, the band toured through the US, Australia and Europe with such bands such as Killswitch Engage, Bury Your Dead, Darkest Hour and others. In February/March 2008, Parkway teamed up with Byron Bay bands/friends 50 lions and Word Up!, to complete the Surf Rats Tour of east coast Australia. This tour (travelling to towns not listed on the standard touring circuit) was based around surfing big surf spots on the way. On 12 December 2008 while performing at UNSW Roundhouse, Parkway Drive announced that they were filming a DVD of the show, which would include footage of the performance and a few songs from other bands featured in the Sweat Fest Tour. On 18 January 2009, Parkway Drive announced their headlining US tour with Stick to Your Guns and Mychildren Mybride.

Active in six decades of popular music and frequently reinventing his music and image, Bowie is widely regarded as an innovator, particularly for his work in the 1970s. He has been cited as an influence by many musicians and is known for his distinctive voice and the intellectual depth of his work. \t As a multi-instrumentalist, he is famous for playing the guitar, piano, and saxophone, but also plays the harmonica, drums, cello, marimba, bass guitar, koto, and stylophone. His first single was released in 1964, but he rose to fame with the 1969 single &quot;Space Oddity&quot; and the 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars . Subsequent albums have explored blue-eyed soul, electronica, and new wave, often pre-dating these genres&#x27; popularity or even the point at which they were defined as genres. \t Bowie is one of the most influential rock musicians from the 1970s to the present. He has sold an estimated 136 million albums in his career and has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In addition to his musical career, Bowie has had success as a painter, web-designer, sculptor, Broadway actor starring in The Elephant Man , and film actor starring in many films. \t Bowie is also credited as being a major inspiration behind the new romantic, futurist movement, and subsequent development of electronic/electronica music. \t Bowie frequently brings the worlds of high art, mime, and straight theatre to his stage acts. His most famous on-stage look was that of Ziggy Stardust; other personae include Halloween Jack, Aladdin Sane, and the Thin White Duke. ", "Pale Honey": "Swedish indie rock duo Pale Honey consists of guitarist Tuva Lodmark and drummer Nelly Daltrey. They have been performing music together since elementary school, bonding over a mutual love for acts like Queens of the Stone Age and PJ Harvey. While the two-piece's sound has evolved since those early years, they've managed to maintain a distinct, stripped-down approach. This is readily apparent on Pale Honey, their self-titled debut which was recorded in producer Anders Lagerfors' kitchen. ", "Cazuza": "Agenor de Miranda Araujo Neto, mostly recognized by his artistic name &quot;Cazuza&quot;, was born in April 4, 1958, in Rio De Janeiro. His father, Joao Araujo, was one of the founders of the label Som Livre and his mother was Lucinha Araujo. Since his youth, Cazuza used to keep in touch with music, because of his father&#x27;s job, so that was one of the reasons that brought him to music. Cazuza started to be successful in Brazil as the lead-singer of the rock band Barao Vermelho, recording huge radio hits like &quot;Bete Balanco&quot; and &quot;Pro Dia Nascer Feliz&quot;. With Barao Vermelho, he recorded 3 studio albums: &quot;Barao Vermelho&quot; (1982), &quot;Barao Vermelho 2&quot; (1983) and &quot;Maior Abandonado&quot; (1984). In 1985, the band performed at the first Rock In Rio and in that same year, he left the band to start a solo career. His first solo record was &quot;Exagerado&quot; (1985) and it had big hits like &quot;Exagerado&quot; and &quot;Codinome Beija-Flor&quot;. He released his second album &quot;So Se For A Dois&quot; in 1987 and it was in that year that he found out that he was HIV-positive. Despite his disease, he became incredibly more creative and started writing lots of genius songs. In 1988 he released the great album &quot;Ideologia&quot;. His most famous songs are in this album: &quot;Ideologia&quot;, &quot;Brasil&quot;, &quot;Faz Parte do Meu Show&quot;. Cazuza released one of his biggest hits in the promo-tour of &quot;Ideologia&quot;, the song was called &quot;O Tempo Nao Para&quot; and a live album was released with this same name, containing his most successful hits from the solo career. In February, 1989 Cazuza brought his sickness to the public eye and in August of the same year, he released &quot;Burguesia&quot;, a double-record with many different partnerships. Cazuza died in July 7, 1990 at 32. His music is still alive, though: his work has passed through generations and youngsters really appreciate his albums. &quot;The ignorant people are the happiest. They don&#x27;t know when they&#x27;re going to die, but I do. I know I have a scheduled meeting. People forget what they have to do, but I can&#x27;t give myself this pleasure. I make everything fit in my next few days, all the ideas I would have, all the people I would meet, what I would still sing. I&#x27;m pregnant but I can&#x27;t wait, the time doesn&#x27;t stop and we go by running&#8230; But I&#x27;m here, trying to hold on to whatever I can. I&#x27;m weak. There&#x27;s a whole world around us that we don&#x27;t even notice. I&#x27;m skinny and small for my clothes. I feel like I am putting all my things together, concentrating. If I could, I&#x27;d put all of them into a bottle and I&#x27;d drink them all. I wonder what shall be left of me&#8230; but I, I can only insist. &quot; &ndash; This text is a direct translation, so it may not have as much meaning as it does in its original language. ", "Slayer": "Slayer is a thrash metal band from US, formed in 1981. The band was founded by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King. The band was credited as one of the &quot;Big Four&quot; thrash metal bands, along with Metallica, Anthrax, and Megadeth. Slayer&#x27;s musical traits involve fast tremolo picking, guitar solos, double bass drumming, and shouting vocals. The band&#x27;s lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as death, deviants, suicide, genocide, necrophilia, insanity, Nazism, religion, Satanism, serial killers, and warfare have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and strong criticism from religious groups and the general public. Slayer is best known for speaking through perspective without being necessarily sympathetic to the cause of their inspiration. Since their debut record in 1983, the band has released two live albums, one cover album, one box set, three DVDs, one VHS, two EPs, and eleven studio albums, four of which have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received three Grammy nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song &quot;Eyes of the Insane&quot;, and one in 2008 for the song &quot;Final Six&quot;. They have headlined music festivals worldwide, including Unholy Alliance and Ozzfest. Slayer was formed in 1981 in Huntington Park, Los Angeles, California. The Band was formed by guitarists Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King when they met at a tryout for a local band. Tom Araya soon joined on bass and vocals, and drummer Dave Lombardo joined last later in 1982. They played in a style reminiscent of early Exodus, influenced heavily by punk acts Minor Threat, Stooges and Heavy Metal bands Venom and Judas Priest. &quot; Black Magic &quot;, the heaviest, darkest, and most evil song at the time (according to some), was written in February, 1983, and marked Slayer &#x27;s definite venture into thrash metal. They secured a spot on the compilation appeareance &quot; Metal Massacre III &quot; in 1983, contributing the speed metal song &quot;Aggressive Perfector&quot;. They also recorded two demos in 1983, and became a popular live act in the Los Angeles area. (In 1983, Bob Gourley filled in for Dave for one gig. He later appeared in Dark Angel (US). ) Their debut LP, Show No Mercy , was recorded in November, 1983. ) A live EP was recorded in the studio in front of 50 of their closest friends in January, 1984, and after that &quot;Show No Mercy&quot; was released. The &quot; Haunting the Chapel &quot; and &quot; Live Undead &quot; EPs followed. After 1985&#x27;s &quot; Hell Awaits &quot;, Slayer were signed to Rick Rubin&#x27;s Def Jam record label, better known for acts like Run DMC. This led to three studio albums, including the brutal &quot; Reign in Blood &quot;, as well as a 1991 live double CD, &quot; Decade of Aggression &quot;. Dave Lombardo left the band in 1987 for several weeks, and was replaced for a few live gigs by Tony Scaglione (Whiplash (US)), and then again left in 1992. Finally, in 1994, Paul Bostaph from Forbidden was brought in, and three more albums were recorded. Then, in 2001, Bostaph left to join Systematic, and Lombardo, who had been in Grip Inc. and Fantomas rejoined the band. Interesting facts: It&#x27;s official that Slayer is the most covered metal band in the world aside from Metallica and Iron Maiden. Tom Araya (born Tomas Enrique Araya June 6, 1961 in Vina del Mar, Chile. He has provided guest vocals to recordings by other artists, including &quot;Iron Gland&quot; from Alice in Chains&#x27; album Dirt, and &quot;Terrorist&quot; from Soulfly&#x27;s album Primitive. His brother is John Araya (Bloodcum (US), Thine Eyes Bleed) Kerry King recorded a guitar solo for &quot;No Sleep Til&#x27; Brooklyn&quot; by the popular hip-hop/rock group Beastie Boys. Tom Araya&#x27;s brother John (Bloodcum (US), Thine Eyes Bleed) worked as an sound engineer for Slayer in their early days. According the book of Jarek Szubrycht (Lux Occulta) &quot;Bez litosci. Prawdziwa historia zespo?u Slayer &quot;, Greg Hall was asked to play with Slayer after Tony Scaglione left the band in January 1987. It never happens because Lombardo returned to the band. Gene Hoglan, the legendary drummer who has played in bands such as Dark Angel (US), Strapping Young Lad and Death, used to be a Slayer lights man and roadie on the Show No Mercy tour, and was asked to be Dave Lombardo&#x27;s drum tech on the Haunting North America tour (&#x27;84), but knocked it back to pursue his own music career. He even did backup vocals on the album Show No Mercy (the song Evil Has No Boundaries). Birth Dates: Tom Araya (06 June 1961 Vina del Mar, Chile) Jeff Hannemann (31 January 1964 Oakland, CA) Kerry King (03 June 1964 Los Angeles, CA) Dave Lombardo (16 February 1965 Havana, Cuba) Paul Bostaph (26 March 1964 Newark, CA)+ Rumor has it the band was originally known as Dragonslayer, after the 1981 movie of the same name. However, when King was asked &quot;How did you come up with the name Dragonslayer?&quot; King responded &quot;We never did; it&#x27;s a myth to this day. &quot;", "The Arcs": "The Arcs are Dan Auerbach (The Black Keys), Leon Michels (Menahan Street Band), Richard Swift (The Shins, Starflyer 59), Homer Steinweiss (Menahan Street Band), and Nick Movshon (Menahan Street Band); also on their new album entitled &quot;Yours Dreamily&quot; are Kenny Vaughan and Mariachi Flor de Toloache. http://www. thearcs. com/ https://www. facebook. com/TheArcsMusic", "FIDLAR": "FIDLAR are a lo-fi garage/surf rock band from Los Angeles, California.

", "Kanye West": "Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia) is a Grammy award winning rapper, producer, author, designer and singer. He began making beats and rapping in the early 90s in Chicago, IL, United States when he formed the rap group Go Getters with Chicago natives GLC and Really Doe. He later gained nationwide popularity in New York when he began producing tracks for artists such as Jay-Z, Twista, Mase, Talib Kweli and Alicia Keys. West's style of production often utilizes pitched-up vocal samples, usually from soul songs, with his own drums and instruments. The first major label song he produced was The Truth by Beanie Sigel, and his first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was This Can't Be Life, a track from Jay-Z's The Dynasty: Roc La Familia. West said he sped up the drum beat of Dr. Dre's Xxplosive to use as a replacement for his drums on This Can't Be Life. West has said that Wu-Tang Clan producer RZA influenced him in his style, and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers Ghostface Killah and Ol' Dirty Bastard were some of his all-time favorites. Said by Kanye West: \"Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time. . . We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the style I use, RZA has been doing that. \" In 2004 (after being pushed aside by many record companies who felt he wasn&#x27;t a marketable hip hop artist), he managed to release his debut solo album, The College Dropout on Roc-A-Fella Records. The album received critical acclaim, defining the style for which West would become known: &quot;wordplay&quot; and heavy sampling of 70s soul and RnB tracks. He is also known for his politically-charged rhymes and controversial behavior both inside and outside the realms of music. He has since released five more albums, all of which have received numerous awards, high commercial success and critical acclaim. Late Registration (2005); Graduation (2007); 808s &amp; Heartbreak (2008); My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010); Yeezus (2013). My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, West&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released in November 2010 to rave reviews from critics, many of whom described it as his best work that solidified his comeback. In stark contrast to his previous effort, which featured a minimalist sound, Dark Fantasy adopts a maximalist philosophy and deals with themes of celebrity and excess. The record included the international hit All of the Lights, and Billboard hits Power, Monster, and Runaway, the latter of which accompanied a 35-minute film of the same name. During this time, West initiated the free music program G. O. O. D. Fridays through his website, offering a free download of previously unreleased songs each Friday of the week, a portion of which were included on the album. Dark Fantasy went on to go platinum in the United States, but its omission as a contender for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammy Awards was viewed as a &quot;snub&quot; by several media outlets. Following a headlining set at Coachella 2011 that was described by The Hollywood Reporter as &quot;one of greatest hip-hop sets of all time,&quot; West released the collaborative album Watch the Throne with Jay-Z. By employing a sales strategy that released the album digitally weeks before its physical counterpart, Watch the Throne became one of the few major label albums in the Internet age to avoid a leak. Niggas in Paris became the record&#x27;s highest charting single, peaking at number five on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2012, West released the compilation album Cruel Summer, a collection of tracks by artists from West&#x27;s record label GOOD Music. Cruel Summer produced four singles, two of which charted within the top twenty of the Hot 100: Mercy and Clique. West also directed a film of the same name that premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival in custom pyramid-shaped screening pavilion featuring seven screens. Sessions for West&#x27;s sixth solo effort begin to take shape in early 2013 in his own personal loft&#x27;s living room at a Paris hotel. Determined to &quot;undermine the commercial,&quot; he once again brought together close collaborators and attempted to incorporate Chicago drill, dancehall, acid house, and industrial music. Primarily inspired by architecture, West&#x27;s perfectionist tendencies led him to contact producer Rick Rubin fifteen days shy of its due date to strip down the record&#x27;s sound in favor of a more minimalist approach. Initial promotion of his sixth album included worldwide video projections of the album&#x27;s music and live television performances. Yeezus, West&#x27;s sixth album, was released June 18, 2013 to rave reviews from critics. It became the rapper&#x27;s sixth consecutive number one debut. Def Jam issued &quot;Black Skinhead&quot; to radio in July 2013 as the album&#x27;s lead single. On September 6, 2013, Kanye West announced he would be headlining his first solo tour in five years, to support Yeezus , with fellow American rapper Kendrick Lamar, accompanying him along the way. In November 2013, West stated that he was working on and recording his next studio album. The album is being produced by Rick Rubin and Q-Tip. In April 2014, he appeared in Future&#x27;s new single titled I Won. Kanye released the first single from the album on December 31, 2014 entitled Only One. All Day the second single from Kanye&#x27;s new album was released on March 2, 2015. West had originally stated the album would be called &#x27;So Help Me God&#x27; but in May, 2015, changed the album title to &#x27;SWISH&#x27;. Personal life: West was born in Atlanta, Georgia. When he was three years old (as mentioned in Hey Mama) his parents divorced, and he moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, was a former Black Panther; one of the first black photojournalists at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution; and is now a Christian counselor. Kanye's late mother, Dr. Donda West, worked as a Professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, and the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as Kanye's manager. He was later raised in an upper middle class background, attending Polaris High School in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois after living in Chicago. After attending The American Academy of Art, a Chicago art school, West attended Chicago State University but eventually dropped out due to poor grades and in order to continue working on his music career. While attending school, West produced for local artists, including on rapper Grav's debut album Down to Earth. He later gained fame by producing hit singles for major hip hop/R&amp;B artists, including Jay-Z, Talib Kweli, Cam'ron, Paul Wall, Common, Mobb Deep, Jermaine Dupri, Scarface, The Game, Alicia Keys, Janet Jackson and John Legend among others. He also \"ghost-produced\" for his once mentor Deric Angelettie according to his song Last Call and the credits of Nas' Poppa Was a Playa. Kanye is married to Kim Kardashian. They have one child together named North. ", "Kasabian": "Kasabian are a rock band from Leicester, England, United Kingdom. The band consists of Tom Meighan (vocals), Sergio Pizzorno (guitar, synths, vocals), Christopher Edwards (bass), Ian Matthews (drums) and guitarist Tim Carter. The band has been compared with the likes of Primal Scream, with their similar electronica-indie rock fusion and Oasis, with whom they share their confidence, vision, swagger and rough vocal style. The band formed in 1997 in Leicester, England and are named after Linda Kasabian, who was the getaway driver at the Tate-LaBianca murders committed by members of the Manson Family. Their eponymous first album was released in 2004 and received average reviews. However, tracks such as Cutt Off and L. S. F. (Lost Souls Forever) reached the UK Top 10, and with two more Top 20 hits and the album peaking at #4 in the UK Album Chart, they defied the critics. The second album, Empire, was released on the 28th of August 2006. The first single from the album, also titled Empire, was widely regarded as a musical success, with its change of beat and its catchy chorus. This was then followed by the release of the singles Shoot The Runner and Me Plus One. The third album, West Ryder Pauper Lunatic Asylum, was released on the 5th of June 2009. The hit single off the album Fire reached #3 in the Official UK Singles Chart, making it the band&#x27;s highest charting single to date. Switchblade Smiles, the first track released from Kasabian&#x27;s fourth album, Velociraptor!, was debuted during Zane Lowe&#x27;s show on BBC Radio 1 on June 7, 2011. The album was released in September 2011 and became Kasabian&#x27;s third consecutive #1 album in the UK. ", "My Chemical Romance": "My Chemical Romance was an American rock band from New Jersey, United States formed in 2001. The band consisted of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro. and Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and keyboardist James Dewees. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002. They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later. The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favorable reviews among music critics. Their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was released on November 22, 2010, to positive reviews. The band&#x27;s final release was a series of singles, released over the course of five months, collected on the compilation Conventional Weapons. The band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. On March 25, 2014, the band released May Death Never Stop You: The Greatest Hits 2001-2013, a greatest hits album containing material spanning their entire career, as well as some previously unreleased material. ", "BUGY CRAXONE": "During the first nine years of their existence, the cryptically named BUGY CRAXONE (buzikurakushiyon) has been one of the busiest and most prolific bands in Japan&#x27;s underground. Originally forming in Sapporo in 1997, the band uprooted to Tokyo in 1998 and scored a contract with major label Victor Entertainment, their debut album blanket following in December of 1999. Bugy Craxone&#x27;s early sound was through and through (but well-executed) alt-rock: Suzuki Yukiko&#x27;s delicate and occasionally blustery vocals, comparable with the lighter side of soon-to-be contemporary Mikami Chisako (of fra-foa), juxtaposed with beefy power chords. Their slightly dark sound, occasional quiet passages and array of sound effects harken back to mid-90s Britpop, The Bends lending a clear influence. The band&#x27;s sound continued in a similar but slightly more tortured direction through their sophomore album, 2000&#x27;s Yuganda Ao to Hakenai Kanjou no Soko. After the tour in support of Yuganda Ao, bassist Kudou Shinya departed, the first of many changes in store for the band. After a year of decreased activity in 2001, Bugy Craxone sprung into action early in 2002, releasing their third album This is NEW SUNRISE, featuring guest musicians including audio active and Thee Michelle Gun Elephant&#x27;s Chiba Yusuke. They also started a series of live shows under the name &quot;COUNTERBLOW&quot; that now numbers 16 and has included bands such as Acidman and Lost in Time. In July, Bugy Craxone released yet another album, their final with Victor, NORTHERN HYMNS. A shocking departure into stripped-down, harshly produced garage rock, the band had jumped head first into a new style that stood in stark contrast to their previous melodic leanings. 2003 was a transition year, starting with the addition of Asahi Tsukasa in March as support bassist for the band&#x27;s &quot;Kaisen Zenya 001&quot; tour. He would become a full member in April, the same month that Bugy Craxone, now separated from Victor, formed their own label, ZubRockA. Meanwhile, more personnel changes were in store, as drummer Miki Hiroshi departed in October, to be replaced by Monchi shortly thereafter. 2004 saw a string of limited production, Tower Records-only releases, including two live DVDs and the band&#x27;s fifth album, sorry, I will scream here, which showcased an improved rhythmic section and guitar interplay to advance the band&#x27;s garage rock agenda. After continued touring, Bugy Craxone returned in late 2005 with their self-titled album which further improved on the formula advanced on sorry.

Her debut album, 19, was released in January 2008 and entered the UK album chart at #1. The album has since received four-times Platinum certification in the UK and has sold 5,500,000 copies worldwide. The album included the hugely popular song Chasing Pavements. 19 earned Adele two Grammy Awards in February 2009 for Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Her second album, 21, was released on January 24th 2011 in the UK and propelled Adele to unprecedented mega-stardom. In just eleven months, 21 received fourteen-times Platinum certification in the UK for shipments in excess of 4,500,000 copies, and has sold a further 6,200,000 copies in the US denoting sextuple-Platinum status. As of January 2012, 21 has sold an estimated seventeen million copies worldwide. The album has produced three global chart-topping singles thus far: Rolling in the Deep, Someone Like You, and Set Fire to the Rain. 21 won Adele six awards at the 2012 Grammy Awards, among them Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year. Adele graduated from BRIT School in Croydon in May 2006, where she was classmates with Leona Lewis. Adele credits the school with nurturing her talent. In school, she was more interested in going into A&amp;R, and hoped to launch other people&#x27;s careers. Four months later, she published two songs on the fourth issue of the online arts publication PlatformsMagazine. com. She had recorded a three-song demo for a class project and gave it to a friend who posted it on Myspace where it became very successful and led to a phone call from music label XL Recordings. She doubted if the offer was real because the only record company she knew was Virgin Records, and she took a friend with her to the meeting. Nick Huggett at XL Recordings recommended Adele to manager Jonathan Dickins at September Management and in June 2006 Dickins became her official representative. September was managing Jamie T at the time and this proved a major attraction for Adele who was a big fan of the English singer-songwriter. Huggett then signed Adele to XL Recordings in September 2006. Adele&#x27;s breakthrough song, Hometown Glory, was released in October 2007. Adele provided vocals for Jack Penate&#x27;s song, My Yvonne, from his debut album. Adele became the first recipient of the BRIT Awards Critics&#x27; Choice and was named the number-one predicted breakthrough act of 2008 in an annual BBC poll of music critics, Sound of 2008. She released her second single Chasing Pavements on 14 January 2008, two weeks ahead of her debut album, 19. Chasing Pavements reached number two on the UK Chart, and stayed there for four weeks, finally remaining in the Top 40 14 weeks after its release. The album itself entered the British charts at number one. The Times Encyclopedia of Modern Music would name 19 an &quot;essential&quot; Blue Eyed Soul recording. In June 2013, Adele was awarded an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours list for services to music. Adele&#x27;s third album is rumoured to be released in later half of 2015. ", "Cash Box Kings": "Considered the &quot;Young Turks&quot; of the Chicago blues scene, the Cash box Kings are dedicated to carrying on the spirit of the 1940&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s post-war Chicago blues sound as well as the Delta blues music of the 20's and 30's. But these illustrious torch bearers also add a bravado, energy and freshness to the mix that results in a distinctive musical experience. With a focus on the raw, stripped-down, ensemble playing that was the hallmark of the post-war sound, the band showcases the music of Chess Records and Sun Records while adding a healthy dose of original music that captures the essence of the Memphis and Chicago blues sounds of the 40's and 50's. The CBKs were just awarded the 2010 Blues Blast Music Magazine &quot;Sean Costello Rising Star&quot; Award and are regular headliners at Chicago venues like Buddy Guy&#x27;s, Rosa&#x27;s Lounge, Nick&#x27;s and the Smoke Daddy. They have played several successful European tours and have headlined Euro festivals like the Lucerne Blues Festival and the Hondarribia Blues Festival. They have also performed several times at the Chicago Blues Festival. Their last two CDs, &quot;I-94 Blues&quot; and &quot;Cuttin&#x27; Heads Live&quot;, both spent three consecutive months in the Top Ten of the Living Blues U. S. Radio Charts. The CBKs have also performed and collaborated with Chicago blues giants like Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy, Willie &#x27;Big Eyes&#x27; Smith, Billy Boy Arnold, and Lurrie Bell. Described as the &quot;Young Turks&quot; of the Chicago blues scene, the Cash Box Kings&#x27; recordings and live performances have earned them rave reviews on both sides of the Atlantic. Although the lineup has changed over the last ten years, the Cash Box Kings are still anchored by Joe Nosek, Oscar Wilson, and Kenny &#x27;Beedy Eyes&#x27; Smith. Son of the legendary Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith (Muddy Waters&#x27; drummer from 1968-1981). The band is now joined by a rotating cast of newly crowned Kings including Billy Flynn (guitar, mandolin, vocals, harmonica), Joel Paterson (guitar and vocals), Jimmy Sutton (upright bass and vocals), Beau Sample (upright bass and vocals), Chris &quot;CB&quot; Boeger (bass) and Mark Haines (drums). Barrelhouse Chuck, piano and vocals, also regularly performs with the group. Official Website: Cash Box Kings", "Madonna": "Madonna Louise Ciccone (born on 16 August 1958 in Bay City, Michigan, United States), known simply as Madonna, is a recording artist, entrepreneur and occasional actress, often referred to as The Queen of Pop. Throughout her career, many of her songs have hit number one on international music charts, including Like a Virgin, Papa Don&#x27;t Preach, Like a Prayer, Vogue, Frozen, Music, Hung Up, and 4 Minutes (feat. Justin Timberlake &amp; Timbaland). Madonna has been praised by critics for her diverse musical productions while at the same time serving as a lightning rod for religious controversy, specifically and especially with the Catholic Church. Her career has been further enhanced by film appearances, despite mixed reviews. She won critical acclaim and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for her role in Evita (1996), but has received harsh feedback for other film roles. Madonna&#x27;s other ventures include being a fashion designer, children&#x27;s book author, film director and producer. She has been acclaimed as a businesswoman, and signed an unprecedented US $120 million contract with Live Nation in 2007. Madonna has sold more than 300 million records worldwide and is recognized as the world&#x27;s top-selling female recording artist of all time by the Guinness World Records. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked Madonna number two (after The Beatles) on the Billboard Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists, making her the most successful solo artist in the history of the chart. Considered to be one of the &quot;25 Most Powerful Women of the 20th Century&quot; by Time for being an influential figure in contemporary music, Madonna is known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, and for retaining a standard of autonomy within the recording industry. She is recognized as an inspiration among numerous music artists. After signing to Sire Records in 1982, Madonna&#x27;s debut single Everybody was released in October of the same year. One year later, her eponymous debut album followed, and since then hits such as Holiday, Like a Virgin, Papa Don't Preach and Like a Prayer catapulted her to massive success. By the 1990s, her commercially successful albums, constantly reinvented image, groundbreaking music videos and controversial nature would earn her the title \"Queen of Pop. \" Apart from achieving 12 No. 1 singles, 37 top 10 singles and 48 top 40 hits on the U. S. Billboard Hot 100, Madonna also maintains the record for the most separate calendar weeks as a female artist with a charting single in any position (853+ weeks). She has also garnered 21 MTV Video Music Awards - the most by any artist (including the special Video Vanguard Award), eight Grammy Awards, as well as a Best Actress (Musical or Comedy) Golden Globe Award for her performance in \"Evita\". Two soundtrack cuts performed by Madonna, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; and &quot;You Must Love Me&quot;, have been awarded with Academy Awards (Oscars). On the United World Chart, Madonna is the Most Successful Singles Artist of All Time and has a record of 13 number one singles. Madonna also holds the record of 40 #1 Hot Dance Club Play hits in the US, the most for any artist ever. Her 2008-2009 Sticky &amp; Sweet Tour remains the two highest-grossing concert tour ever by a female solo artist, having grossed US$ 408 million. Madonna&#x27;s upcoming 13th studio album, Rebel Heart, was released in March 2015. Initially scheduled for release in late April 2015, the release of the album was brought forward to early March 2015 following the leak of 13 early demo recordings in December 2014, while six tracks from the album were officially released into iTunes on 20 December 2014. On the same day, Living for Love was released as the album&#x27;s lead single.

The group consists of Lauren Mayberry (lead vocals, occasionally synths and samplers), Iain Cook (synths, guitar, bass, vocals) and Martin Doherty (synths, samplers, vocals).

Doherty was a live member of The Twilight Sad. According to Mayberry, &quot;Iain and Martin went to university together so they&#x27;ve known each other for quite a long time&quot;. The band started in October 2011 as a studio project between the long time friends Iain Cook and Martin Doherty. Cook already knew Lauren Mayberry from working with Blue Sky Archives and suggested her as a potential vocalist for the project. CHVRCHES were influenced by acts such as Prince, Tubeway Army, Robyn, Depeche Mode, Kate Bush, Cocteau Twins, Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston and Laurie Anderson. The band write, record, mix and master everything in a basement studio in Glasgow. In May 2012, they released the song &quot;Lies&quot;.

They formed in Montreal, Quebec, Canada in 2001. The band consists of Win Butler (vocals, guitar, piano), Regine Chassagne (vocals, accordion, keyboards, hurdy gurdy, drums), Richard Reed Parry (bass, guitar), William Butler (keyboards, guitar), Tim Kingsbury (bass), and Jeremy Gara (drums). Montreal percussionist Dane Mills performed on the EP and in early live shows. As of May 2005, the touring band includes horn players and violinists. The band's trademark fashion consists in wearing rather formal attire during live events and a use of orchestral instruments. When asked about the rumour that the band&#x27;s name refers to a fire in an arcade, Win Butler replied: &quot;It&#x27;s not a rumour, it&#x27;s based on a story that someone told me. It&#x27;s not an actual event, but one that I took to be real. I would say that it&#x27;s probably something that the kid made up, but at the time I believed him. &quot; Win Butler and his brother Will grew up in Texas. Band formation Arcade Fire formed around the husband and wife duo of Win Butler and Regine Chassagne. Joining together as recently as mid-2003, the current line-up solidified in late 2003/early 2004, when their first full-length album Funeral was recorded. Before this an eponymous EP (often referred to by fans as the Us Kids Know EP ) had been sold at early shows. The EP was subsequently remastered and given a full release once the band started becoming more prominent. Arcade Fire are known for their enthralling live performances, as well as its use of a large number of musical instruments. In addition to mainstays guitar, drums, and bass guitar, members play piano, violin, viola, cello, double bass, xylophone, keyboard, French horn, accordion, and harp. With several able musicians, the band take most of their instrumental diversity on tour and members switch instrumental duties throughout their shows. The number of instruments, along with a wide set of musical influences has provided a substantial number of resources on which to draw from during the recording process. The promise showed by the band in its live shows allowed it to land a record contract with Chapel Hill-based independent record label Merge Records. Funeral Without a major label backing, the success of the band and the album Funeral has been acclaimed as an Internet phenomenon. After a 9. 7 rating from Pitchfork, Merge Records sold out their inventory of Funeral and it became the label&#x27;s first album in the Billboard 200 chart. An early tip from David Bowie was also influential. The band booked small clubs for their 2004 tour but growing interest forced many venue changes, far beyond the band&#x27;s expectations, and continued internationally into mid-2005. The MTV2 2005 Review hosted by Zane Lowe named Funeral Album of the Year, and NME named Funeral Number 2 in their list of 2005&#x27;s best albums and &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot; the best track. By November 2005, Funeral had gone gold in both Canada and the UK and sold in excess of half a million copies worldwide, a phenomenal number for an independent release with minimal television or radio exposure. It has also surpassed Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s In The Aeroplane Over The Sea as the biggest selling Merge Records album to date. Arcade Fire were featured on the April 4, 2005 cover of Time Magazine&#x27;s Canadian edition, and hailed as a band who &quot;helped put Canadian music on the world map&quot;. On April 2, 2006, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, they received the Juno Award for Songwriters Of The Year for three songs from Funeral: &quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;Rebellion (Lies)&quot; and &quot;Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)&quot;. Arcade Fire then planned to begin recording a follow up to Funeral in the winter of 2005-2006, having bought an old church forty minutes from central Montreal which they converted into a studio.  Neon Bible In mid-December 2006 www. neonbible. com went live containing nothing more than a phone number, 1-866-NEONBIBLE where people can listen to a new track called Intervention . Built in the style of customer support lines, the number has other features including a contest and a chance to talk to a live person at a specific time each week. Then in January 2007, they finally announced that the new album Neon Bible would be released March 5th in UK, March 6th in US. The announcement was made with a video in the album&#x27;s website, with guitarist Richard Reed Parry using a gramophone and a paper mask of Parry&#x27;s own face, and sitting on Win Butler's chair. After the announcement of the album's release, the website was updated with a streaming version of &quot;Black Mirror&quot;, new art and a few phone messages sounding like the band's members. The Suburbs The band released their third album &quot;The Suburbs&quot; on August 2, 2010 in the UK and August 3, 2010 in the United States. It debuted at #1 in both countries. On February 13, 2011, the album won Album of the Year at the 53rd Grammy Awards. Arcade Fire recorded a song for The Hunger Games soundtrack (The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond), called &quot;Abraham&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. The song is featured in the movie&#x27;s end credits. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200. It sold more than 175,000 copies in its first week according to Nielsen SoundScan. It&#x27;s the first theatrical film soundtrack to top the chart since Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;This Is It&quot; debuted at No. 1 on the list. It is also only the 16th soundtrack to debut at No. 1 in the history of the Billboard 200 chart (those soundtracks include film, television, and straight-to-video efforts). Reflektor Arcade Fire and Mercury Records confirmed that they would release a fourth album in late 2013. In December 2012, the band&#x27;s manager Scott Rodger confirmed that Arcade Fire was in the studio working with James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem. The official Arcade Fire pre-order website sets the release date on October 28, 2013. The band announced on January 18, 2013 that they were selling the church they had been using as a studio due to a collapsed roof. Throughout 2013, the band worked on the album in several different recording studios - including Murphy&#x27;s DFA Records studio in New York. On June 22, 2013, Rolling Stone reported that new material from the album would be released on September 9, 2013.

The band is influenced by the sounds of classic &#x27;60s baroque pop, power pop, and new wave The band gained recognition in the United Kingdom and United States during 2006 and 2007 due to the success of their single &quot;Young Folks&quot;, whilst staying virtually unknown in their homeland, Sweden. ", "Battles": "Battles is an American experimental rock band founded in New York City in 2002 and now consisting of Dave Konopka (formerly of Lynx) on guitar and bass, John Stanier (of Tomahawk and The Mark of Cain , formerly of Helmet) on drums, and guitarist/keyboardist Ian Williams (formerly of Don Caballero and Storm &amp; Stress) on guitars and keyboards. Until 2010 they were joined by Tyondai Braxton (son of avant-garde jazz composer and multi-instrumentalist Anthony Braxton) on vocals, keyboards and guitar, who departed the band amicably in order to concentrate on his solo career. Stanier&#x27;s drum setup is defined by both its bright yellow color and its extremely high Zildjian K ride cymbal, arguably the band&#x27;s most distinctive visual trademarks. He believes the ride cymbal is overused in drumming, so he wanted to make it more of an effort to play it, forcing himself to jump up from his seat to hit it during live performances. The band released two EPs and a single in 2004, each on a different record label (Cold Sweat, Monitor and Dim Mak); all three releases were packaged together in a reissue on Warp in 2006. With hype built up around their initial EPs and the &quot;Atlas&quot; single (which included a remix by DJ Koze), Battles released their debut album Mirrored via Warp on May 14, 2007 to substantial critical acclaim. &quot;Tonto&quot; was later issued as a single in October, its accompanying video directed by design group United Visual Artists and then soon bundled with an EP that featured remixes by Four Tet and The Field. Gloss Drop , the band&#x27;s sophomore album, was released on June 6, 2011 (again on Warp), anchored by singles &quot;Ice Cream&quot; and &quot;My Machines. &quot; In lieu of the departed Braxton, several guest vocalists were brought in: Chilean DJ/producer Matias Aguayo on &quot;Ice Cream,&quot; British singer/musician Gary Numan on &quot;My Machines,&quot; Japanese musician Kazu Makino (of Blonde Redhead) on &quot;Sweetie &amp; Shag,&quot; and Japanese vocalist/multi-instrumentalist Yamantaka Eye (of Boredoms) on &quot;Sundome. &quot; Like its predecessor the album was met with positive reviews, with many critics praising the guest vocal spots. A four-part remix album series via Warp entitled Dross Glop arrived in the spring of 2012 (later bundled into a compilation), featuring interpretations of Gloss Drop &#x27;s tracklist by Gui Boratto, The Field, The Alchemist, Shabazz Palaces, Kode9 (owner of Hyperdub), Silent Servant (of Sandwell District), Kangding Ray, Hans-Joachim Roedelius (as Qluster), Brian DeGraw (of Gang Gang Dance), \tHudson Mohawke, Patrick Mahoney &amp; Dennis McNany (also known as Museum of Love), and Yamantaka Eye. In 2015, following a characteristically extended break of writing and recording, Battles announced their third album entitled La De Da Di , to be released by Warp on September 18, 2015. They debuted four songs including lead track &quot;The Yabba&quot; on a livestream in August. ", "Britney Spears": "Britney Jean Spears (born on December 2, 1981 in Kentwood, LA, United States, and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana, United States) is a Grammy-winning multi-platinum American pop singer, songwriter, dancer and occasional actress. She debuted in 1998 with her single &#8230;Baby One More Time. She is one of the most influential and popular post-2000 icons of music.

It stayed on the Billboard 200 for two years until it was moved to the Pop Catalog chart. According to the RIAA, it is the 27th best-selling album in American music history, and 4th best-selling album by a female artist. This album, its lyrics, and its music videos maintained the typical virgin image of the late 1990s teen pop revival for Spears. Following the success of her debut album, Spears released the album &#x27;Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again&#x27; in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the U. S. by selling 1,319,193 units during its first week of sales, breaking the SoundScan record for the highest album sales in its debut week by any solo artist. The RIAA awarded the album with a diamond certification with 10 million copies sold in the U. S. Spears released her third studio album &#x27;Britney&#x27; in November 2001.

Spears released her fourth studio album &#x27;In the Zone&#x27; in November 2003, jettisoning the Max Martin-produced synthpop of her earlier releases. The album took in lesser-known producers such as RedZone and big names including Moby and R. Kelly. Spears co-wrote eight of the album&#x27;s thirteen songs and co-produced several pieces of her material for the first time. &#x27;In the Zone&#x27; reached number one in the U. S. charts during its debut week, selling over 609,000 copies. This made Spears the first female in the Nielsen SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one. All three singles, Me Against The Music, Toxic and Everytime, reached #1 on the Australian ARIA charts. &#x27;Toxic&#x27; became one of Britney&#x27;s signature songs and the video is considered by most to be her best. In July 2004, Spears became engaged to back-up dancer Kevin Federline. She and Federline were married on September 18 that same year. She also released a fragrance in September 2004, entitled Curious , and another, Fantasy , the following year. In early 2006, she released the limited edition fragrance In Control Curious . She released two more fragrances in 2007 and 2009 : Believe and Hidden Fantasy . November 2004 saw the release of her first greatest hits collection, &#x27;Greatest Hits: My Prerogative&#x27;, which features all of Spears&#x27;s singles up to &#x27;Outrageous&#x27; with the exception of &quot;From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart&quot;. It also featured three previously unreleased songs, a cover version of American R&amp;B singer Bobby Brown&#x27;s 1988 hit &quot;My Prerogative&quot;, &quot;Do Somethin&#x27;&quot;, produced by Bloodshy and Avant, whom she had worked with on In The Zone, and &quot;I&#x27;ve Just Begun (Havin&#x27; My Fun)&quot;, which was a song recorded for Spears&#x27;s fourth album, In The Zone, but did not make the final cut. By the end of that year, Spears had become one of the best-selling artists in the world. Spears and her now husband Kevin, starred in their own reality television show, Britney and Kevin: Chaotic in the first half of 2005. In the final episode of the show, Spears debuted the single Someday (I Will Understand) but the song and video were not released in the US. &#x27;Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic&#8230;&#x27; the bonus CD, includes Mona Lisa and Over To You Now.

The divorce was finalized on July 30, 2007. During 2007, Britney continually lost more and more custody of her children, until her mental breakdown, which resulted in her taking Jayden hostage in a bathroom for over three hours, in Jan 08 stripped her of any visitations whatsoever for over a month. Visitations after the month were heavily monitored. On October 30, 2007 Spears released her 5th studio album entitled &quot;Blackout&quot; with its first single &quot;Gimme More&quot; being performed at the MTV Video Music Awards. &quot;Gimme More was Britney&#x27;s most successful single on the Billboard Hot 100 by peak position since &quot;&#8230;Baby One More Time&quot;. The next two singles from &quot;Blackout&quot; were &#x27;Piece of Me&#x27; and &#x27;Break The Ice&#x27;. Britney did minimal promotion for the album and it&#x27;s singles.

MTV signed a deal with Spears and Jive records to release a documentary titled &#x27;For the Record&#x27;, which aired on November 30, 2008, two days before the release of Circus. The documentary was shot over three months and featured Britney discussing her personal life as well as her career. Circus debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 505,000 copies in its first week. This became Spears&#x27; fifth number one album, making her the only act in Nielsen SoundScan history to have four albums debuted with 500,000 copies or more. It is also Spears&#x27; second album, the first being &#8230;&#x27;Baby One More Time&#x27;, to have charted two top-ten singles as &quot;Circus&quot;, the follow up single to the number-one hit &quot;Womanizer&quot;, debuted at number three on the Hot 100, making it her highest debut on the chart as well as her seventh top ten hit.

The Circus Starring: Britney Spears began its run on March 3, 2009 in Spears&#x27;s home state of Louisiana. Opening night, as well as every following show in North America, sold out. The tour spans through North America (two legs), Europe, and Australia (first time touring ever). Britney is accompanied by her children on the tour, and they are in her custody for over 50% of the time for the duration of the tour while ex-husband Kevin trails her. In April 2009, Spears declared her support for same-sex marriage to the media, following the controversial incident on Miss USA where contestant Carrie Prejean, representing California, expressed her disapproval of same-sex unions. The message left by Spears on her Twitter page read \"Love is love! People should be able to do whatever makes them happy!\" After years of absence, Forbes magazine listed Spears as the 13th most powerful celebrity and the second most top-earning young musician as she made $35 million from June 2008 to June 2009. In July 2009, Spears confirmed through her Twitter that she has begun recording new material, stating that she was going into the studio with producer Max Martin. Also producer and remixer Russ Castella posted a message on Twitter stating that he is working on a track titled &quot;Dirty Girl&quot; for Spears. Castella also announced that the track he is working on would be released later in 2009. In September 2009, Britney won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video for Womanizer. In October of 2009, Spears released the song &quot;3&quot; to iTunes. It stayed at #1 on their charts for thirteen days and debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart. It was the first song to do so in three years and the first song by a non-American Idol singer to have a song debut at #1 in eleven years. In November 2009, Spears completed the Circus Starring: Britney Spears tour. Whilst there was controversy caused by her lip-synching to her shows, other reviews and ticket sales still were strong. In March 2011, Spears released her seventh studio album Femme Fatale. Max Martin and Dr. Luke executive produced the album and the album&#x27;s first single &quot;Hold It Against Me&quot;. The single debuted at number-one on the Billboard Hot 100. This gave Spears her fourth number-one single on the chart, and made her only the second artist in history to have two consecutive singles debut at number-one, after Mariah Carey. The album peaked at number one in the United States (selling 276,000 copies), Canada, and Australia, and peaked inside the top ten on nearly every other chart. The album&#x27;s peak in the United States ties Britney with Mariah Carey and Janet Jackson for the third-most number ones among women. Femme Fatale has sold over 590,000 copies in the United States and has been certified platinum by the RIAA. The album received positive critical reviews after its release, receiving a score of 67 on Metacritic, her highest critical score since Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again, with many critics naming the album one of Spears&#x27;s best. In April 2011, Spears appeared in a remix to the song &quot;S&amp;M&quot; by Rihanna after Rihanna asked her fans via Twitter who they wanted her to collaborate with. The song reached number one in the US in mid-April 2011, giving Britney her fifth number one on the chart. In early May, Spears&#x27; second single from Femme Fatale, &quot;Till The World Ends&quot;, reached number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and had ninety-eight million audience impressions on the Billboard chart, granting Spears the highest weekly audience of her 13-year chart career. Femme Fatale&#x27;s third single &quot;I Wanna Go&quot; reached the top forty on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 2011. Among females in the last thirteen years, Spears now has the third-most top forty hits, with twenty-one. In August, the single managed to reach the top-ten on the Billboard Hot 100, which is the first time for Spears to have three songs from one album in the top-ten. On the week ending September 24, 2011, &quot;I Wanna Go&quot; moved 2-1 on the mainstream top 40, becoming her sixth number-one on that chart (making her tied for third all-time) and her first number-one and third top-ten pop song for Femme Fatale. Spears now has the longest span of number ones on the mainstream top 40, with a length of twelve years, seven months, and four days. On March 2011, Spears announced that she would tour throughout the United States during summer 2011. The Femme Fatale Tour opened June 16 at the Power Balance Pavilion in Sacramento, California to positive reviews. Many critics noted that Spears sang more of the concert live in response to lip-synching accusations during The Circus Starring Britney Spears, and that the dancing is some of her best in years. The first ten US dates of the tour grossed $6. 2 million, landing the fifty-fifth spot on Pollstar&#x27;s Top 100 North American Tours list for the half-way point of the year. The tour travelled to Europe and South and Central America later in 2011.

Furthermore, Britney Jean became Spears&#x27;s final project under her original recording contract with RCA, which had guaranteed the release of eight studio albums. The record received a low amount of promotion and commercial impact, reportedly due to contractual obligations for Britney: Piece of Me. Upon its release, the record debuted at number four on the U. S. Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 107,000 copies, becoming her lowest-peaking and lowest-selling album in the United States.

Influences like The Beach Boys, The Shangri- La&#x27;s, The Ronettes, and Patsy Cline shine through in songs like &quot;When You&#x27;re On&quot;, with front woman Shannon crooning like a scorned Leslie Gore, but with a rough unpolished edge inspired by the likes of The Cramps, Bad Brains, and fellow beach bum Nobunny. ", "Nego E": "", "Ryan Adams": "Ryan Adams (born David Ryan Adams on November 5, 1974) is an alt-country and rock and roll singer-songwriter from Jacksonville, North Carolina. Initially part of the group Whiskeytown, which was at the time considered one of the leaders of the alt-country genre, Adams left the band and released his first solo album, Heartbreaker, in 2000 (which was subsequently nominated for the Shortlist Music Prize). As well as his solo albums, Adams has released five albums as Ryan Adams &amp; the Cardinals. Adams dropped out of high school at age 16 to work in a shoe shop and make music. He formed a band named Whiskeytown in 1994; they disbanded in 1999 having released two full albums, Faithless Street and Strangers Almanac . Adams went on to put out his first solo record, Heartbreaker , in 2000. After a long delay, in 2001 Whiskeytown&#x27;s third album Pneumonia was finally issued. In 2002, Ryan contributed backing vocals on Butterfly in Reverse, from the Counting Crows album, Hard Candy; after Adam Duritz (Counting Crows lead singer) appeared on the album Gold . Ryan is highly prolific, and in 2005 released one double album and two regular albums: Cold Roses , Jacksonville City Nights and 29 , respectively.

In between those two releases and his 2005 triple-header, Ryan released Demolition (a collection of out-takes), Love Is Hell and Rock N Roll . Unreleased studio albums include 48 Hours , Exile On Franklin Street and Suicide Handbook .

The newest and last record with his backing band The Cardinals, Cardinology , was released in October 2008 and followed by extensive touring through the UK, US and Australia. In January 2009 he announced that he would be going on an indefinite hiatus from music. The Kindness Songfacts reports that the major reason for Adams' temporary retirement was his struggles with Meniere's disease, a disorder of the inner ear that wrecks havoc on hearing and balance. Adams resumed performing in October 2010, and released his thirteenth studio album, Ashes &amp; Fire , on October 11, 2011. His wife, pop singer and actress Mandy Moore, contributed some backing vocals.

Their First single, &quot;The Bleeding&quot; landed in the top 40 rock radio charts, eventually worked its way into the top 10 and ruled the radio waves for an astonishing 8 months.

( Under and Over It Songfacts ). Los Angeles, California 2005", "Miami Horror": "Miami Horror are an Australian indie-electronic band from Melbourne, Australia (with the name referring to producer, Benjamin Plant, and to the four-piece live incarnation). Beginning in 2007 under the moniker Miami Horror, Plant started with a series of remixes. The debut release came in 2008 with a five-track EP, Bravado, on Virgin Records. The live show has Plant augmented by Josh Moriarty (Peacocks, ex-Young &amp; Restless) (guitars), DJ/producer Aaron Shanahan (drums), and Daniel Whitechurch (bass, keyboards, and guitars). After years in the making here at last is Illumination, the fully realised debut album from Melbourne&#x27;s favourite psychedelic indie-electronic adventurers Miami Horror. With Illumination, Miami Horror has delivered on two years of teeth-cutting live shows and an ever escalating wave of buzz that's made the group bonafide blog darlings the world over. But what's most amazing about the grand arrival of Illumination is that the roots of the record stretch back countless moons to when Miami Horror began as just one synthesizer-obsessed producer in 2007 huddled over a laptop in a bedroom-come-studio and the album itself just a spark waiting to be lit. The afore mentioned synth tragic was, and let's face it still is, electronic young gun Ben Plant, who kick started Miami Horror out of a love of Roland keyboards and French house, landing himself on Pitchfork's hot-list overnight and copping a barrage of high profile remix requests from the likes of Datarock, PNAU and The Presets. Yet it was while Ben was punching out 2008's epochal Bravado EP that Miami Horror took off in a completely new and different direction. Characteristically wanting to flex his creative muscle and avoid the limitations of being stereotyped as simply a dance or electro act, Ben rewired Miami Horror's genetic makeup, deputising the talents of Josh Moriarty, Aaron Shanahan and Daniel Whitechurch to form a new live band persona of Miami Horror, a whole new beast immeasurably more exciting than before. \"It started out that I didn't want to have any guitar on the album besides a little funk guitar or disco bass,\" Ben grins while explaining the turning point for Miami Horror's evolution. \"But then Josh came in and started playing all these other parts that sounded amazing. Paired with what I was working on, nobody was doing anything like it, so I knew we had to turn those sounds into a live thing and just go wild. \" It worked. Since the switch, Miami Horror has launched into dizzying new stratospheres, their well-polished chops as a group making for some unmissable sets at Australia's biggest festivals, and that's not to mention some A-list support slot call ups for everyone from Phoenix, Friendly Fires and La Roux to a hand-picked hook up from Lily Allen. www. miamihorror. com", "Yo La Tengo": "Yo La Tengo is an American indie rock band formed in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1984. Since 1992, the lineup has consisted of Ira Kaplan (guitars, vocals), Georgia Hubley (drums, vocals), and James McNew (bass, vocals). Despite achieving limited mainstream success, Yo La Tengo has been called &quot;the quintessential critics&#x27; band&quot; and maintain a strong cult following. Additionally, the band is renowned for its encyclopedic repertoire of cover songs both in live performance and on record. Formation and Early History: 1984-1985 Ira Kaplan and Georgia Hubley, a husband/wife duo, formed the band in 1984. They chose the name &quot;Yo La Tengo&quot; (Spanish for &quot;I&#x27;ve got it!&quot;) in an effort to avoid any connotations in English. The name came from a baseball anecdote. During the 1962 season, New York Mets center fielder Richie Ashburn and Venezuelan shortstop Elio Chacon found themselves colliding in the outfield. When Ashburn went for a catch, he would scream, &quot;I got it! I got it!&quot; only to run into Chacon, who spoke only Spanish. Ashburn learned to yell, &quot;!Yo la tengo! !Yo la tengo!&quot; instead. In a later game, Ashburn happily saw Chacon backing off. He relaxed, positioned himself to catch the ball, and was instead run over by left fielder Frank Thomas , who understood no Spanish and had missed a team meeting that proposed using the words &quot;!Yo la tengo! as a way to avoid outfield collisions. After getting up, Thomas asked Ashburn, &quot;What the heck is a Yellow Tango?&quot;. They placed an advertisement to recruit other musicians who shared their love for bands such as The Soft Boys, Mission of Burma, and Arthur Lee&#x27;s Love. The group&#x27;s debut recording was a 7&quot; single entitled &quot;The River of Water&quot; backed with a cover of Arthur Lee&#x27;s &quot;A House Is Not a Motel&quot; released in late 1985 with Dave Schramm on lead guitar and Dave Rick on bass. After recording &quot; Private Doberman &quot; for inclusion on a Coyote Records compilation entitled Luxury Condos Coming to Your Neighborhood , Rick left the band and was replaced by Mike Lewis, the founding bass player of Boston garage-punk bands DMZ and Lyres, who was also a member of Brooklyn garage rock band The A-Bones throughout his tenure. Early Releases: 1986-1989 In 1986, Yo La Tengo released their first LP, Ride the Tiger on Coyote Records. Produced by former Mission of Burma bassist Clint Conley who also took over bass duties on three songs, the album &quot;marked Yo La Tengo as a band with real potential&quot; according to reviewer Mark Deming. Kaplan was credited as &quot;naive guitar&quot; on the sleeve, and in the liner notes for the 1993 reissue of the album on City Slang Records, went so far as to say &quot;Dave&#x27;s guitar playing is inarguably the best thing about the record. &quot; Schramm and Lewis left the band after the album&#x27;s release, with Kaplan subsequently taking on the role of lead guitar and Stephan Wichnewski joining to play bass. The group&#x27;s next album New Wave Hot Dogs (1987) sold poorly, but in the words of Mark Deming, &quot;was a quantum leap over the sound of their debut. &quot; The release of President Yo La Tengo in 1989 did much to establish the band&#x27;s reputation among rock critics including Robert Christgau who praised the &quot;mysterioso guitar hook&quot; in the first song. Produced by Gene Holder of The dB&#x27;s, the album was the band&#x27;s last release on Coyote. Despite the positive reception of the album, sales were still poor and Wichnewski left the band not long after. Hubley and Kaplan carried on as a duo and began playing two-electric-guitar shows. Kaplan, though typically a pragmatist, started carrying a bug trapped in amber in his pocket for luck. Bar/None and Alias Records: 1990-1992 Yo La Tengo reunited with Dave Schramm in 1990 to record Fakebook , an album of mostly acoustic tunes, including covers of Cat Stevens, Gene Clark, The Kinks, Daniel Johnston, among others, with five original songs by the band themselves. Again produced by Gene Holder, the album&#x27;s folk sound was a change of pace for the band. Years later, Kaplan recalled that the album was &quot;just me and Georgia looking for an excuse to record with Dave Schramm and Al Greller&quot; who played guitar and double bass on the album, respectively. In 1991, with Dave Schramm in tow, Yo La Tengo collaborated with Daniel Johnston on the song &quot;Speeding Motorcycle&quot; which was released as a single. The band also released a 7&quot; single on Bar/None Records with the song &quot;Walking Away from You&quot; backed with a cover of Beat Happening&#x27;s &quot;Cast a Shadow. &quot; Gene Holder produced the single and played the bass. The That Is Yo La Tengo EP released later that year included some tracks that would end up on the group&#x27;s next LP. After the release of That Is Yo La Tengo , James McNew began playing bass with the band, forming the trio that continues to make up the band today. According to McNew, \"I originally signed on as a fill-in for a short US tour, and a 4-week summer tour of Europe with Eleventh Dream Day. One night after a show in Munster, I was to look after our box of merchandise while Ira and Georgia went gallovanting through the town, meeting their policemen. Needless to say, during our soundcheck in Hamburg the next day, it suddenly dawned on me that I had left the box filled with copies of this EP back at the club in Munster. Oh man, was I in trouble&#8230; Sure&#8230; blame it on the rookie. \" The band recorded May I Sing with Me in Boston with Holder producing and Lou Giordano engineering. The album was released on Alias Records in 1992. Two of the album&#x27;s eleven songs (&quot;Swing for Life&quot; and &quot;Five-Cornered Drone&quot;) were carried over from the That Is Yo La Tengo EP and feature Holder on bass. The Upside-Down EP was released on CD in support of the album, rounding out the band&#x27;s releases on Alias. Early Matador period: 1993-2000 In 1993, Yo La Tengo began their partnership with Matador Records, releasing a 7&quot; and CD5 of the song &quot;Shaker&quot; which the band recorded with John Siket in New Jersey. The following LP, 1993&#x27;s Painful was also the beginning of the band&#x27;s fruitful creative partnership with producer Roger Moutenot, who has produced all of their subsequent albums. Painful is the first Yo La Tengo to feature James McNew on every song; Rob Sheffield, writing for Rolling Stone remarked that McNew &quot;became an essential part of the sound on Painful , the 1993 album that kept every promise Yo La Tengo ever made and blew their previous highlights away. &quot; Critical reaction was quite positive, with reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine calling it &quot;a subtly addicting album. &quot; Robert Christgau also praised the group once again, writing in his review that Yo La Tengo is &quot;always friendly. This is not the forbidding experimentation of an aspiring vanguard. This is the fooling around of folks who like to go out on Saturday night and make some noise&ndash;and then go home humming it. &quot; The band released Electr-O-Pura in 1995 to similar acclaim. For the first time, all songs were credited to the band as a whole rather than individual members; this became the norm for all future releases. The band&#x27;s 1997 LP I Can Hear the Heart Beating as One synthesized the group&#x27;s eclectic combination of folk, punk rock, shoegazing , long instrumental noise-jams, and electronic music into a sprawling, multi-faceted style. Critical reaction was extremely positive; Pitchfork Media awarded the album a 9. 7 out of 10 and reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it was &quot;arguably Yo La Tengo&#x27;s finest and most coherent album to date. &quot; Kaplan recalled a turning point in the band&#x27;s musical progression: \"I think after Electr-O-Pura we've had a direction of trying not to worry too hard about what the next album is going to sound like. Everything we've ever played on we just do whatever seems right at the moment, we just write a bunch of songs, and then go one baby step at the time and just do what seems right. \" With their critical reputation higher than ever before, the band toured extensively and their fan base continued to grow. In 1998, they collaborated with Jad Fair and released the album Strange But True to mixed reviews. The band entered the studio again in late 1999 to record their ninth LP. And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out was released in February 2000 to a warm reception. Continued Acclaim and Soundtrack Work: 2001-Present In 2001, Yo La Tengo recorded an instrumental score for eight short undersea documentaries by Jean Painleve , entitled The Sounds of the Sounds of Science . The program debuted at the San Francisco Film Festival and has been performed live approximately twelve times. The band also released an EP with covers of Sun Ra&#x27;s &quot;Nuclear War&quot; in late 2002. The band&#x27;s tenth LP, Summer Sun , was released in 2003. Although the album received generally favorable reviews, some critics found the album&#x27;s quiet atmosphere &quot;underwhelming. &quot; Others criticized the band for a perceived lack of invention. When asked about the album&#x27;s quiet nature, Kaplan stated, \"We made a decision at the last second just to leave the loud songs off. We were looking at the material we recorded and just trying to put out the best record that we could. At a certain point, we just thought it seemed right to put out the quiet ones. I&#x27;ve been aware that there&#x27;s been some surprise about that and people saying it&#x27;s even quieter than the last record, which has sort of taken me by surprise. &quot; Yo La Tengo collaborated with Yoko Ono on the 2003 charity album Wig in a Box: Songs from and Inspired by Hedwig and the Angry Inch in support of the Harvey Milk High School . The band put together their first &quot;best of&quot; compilation entitled Prisoners of Love: A Smattering of Scintillating Senescent Songs: 1985-2003 which was released in 2005. They composed scores for four more films: 2005&#x27;s Junebug and Game 6 , and 2006&#x27;s Shortbus and Old Joy . Their scores for these four films were collected on the 2008 compilation They Shoot, We Score . Their eleventh LP, I Am Not Afraid of You and I Will Beat Your Ass , was released in 2006 to universal acclaim. Informed by their soundtrack work, the arrangements included more strings and horns than any of the band&#x27;s previous albums. Kaplan told an interviewer: &quot;I think we gained an element of comfort with using that kind of instrumentation, and it became something we could draw on for our other songs. &quot; In addition, the album was book-ended with two guitar jams lasting over ten minutes each. In 2006, the band released Yo La Tengo Is Murdering the Classics , a compilation of their live impromptu cover-song performances on the New Jersey freeform radio station, WFMU . As part of the station&#x27;s annual fundraising marathon, listeners who call in to pledge money to the station may request a favorite which the band will then perform on the spot. In late 2007, the band began performing acoustically for &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Yo La Tengo&quot; tour. Audiences were encouraged to request songs and ask questions which, Kaplan stated, the band tried to answer &quot;in a strategic manner so that the answers to the questions will lead to the next song. &quot; In March 2008, Yo La Tengo performed under the alias &quot;Condo Fucks&quot; at Brooklyn&#x27;s Magnetic Field. As Condo Fucks, the band released an album of cover songs, Fuckbook , on Matador in March, 2009. On June 4, Matador announced a new Yo La Tengo album called Popular Songs . Yo La Tengo is also contributing to a tribute album for New Zealand rock and roll musician Chris Knox who suffered a stroke in June 2009. All proceeds from the album will go towards Knox&#x27;s recovery. ", "Royksopp": "Royksopp is an electronic music duo formed in 1998 in Tromso, Norway and currently based in Bergen, Norway. The band consists of Torbjorn Brundtland and Svein Berge, both being songwriters, producers and remixers. They usually rely on the use of other vocalists for their songs and occasionally they perform the vocal parts. The Norwegian word &quot;royksopp&quot; means puffball fungus (literally &quot;smoke mushroom&quot;), but the band has stated in interviews that they are actually referring to the mushroom cloud created by atomic bombs. Brundtland and Berge were schoolmates in their hometown Tromso, experimenting with electronic instruments in the early 90s and being a part of their city&#x27;s techno scene. As they grew up in northern Norway, they listened to local artists like Bel Canto and Biosphere. The band has also expressed their interest in the music of Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, Giorgio Moroder, Art of Noise, Vangelis, Erik Satie, and Francis Lai. They were members of various electro acts in their youth, such as Alania, Drum Island and Aedena Cycle. After recording as part of Aedena Cycle, Berge and Brundtland left the group to form their own band, Royksopp. In 8 October 2001, Royksopp released their debut album Melody A. M. on Wall of Sound label. This critically acclaimed downtempo album reached #1 in Norway charts, #9 in UK Albums Chart, #18 in US Top Electronic Albums. Melody A. M. spawned five singles: &quot;So Easy&quot; (released in 1999, re-released in 2002), &quot;Eple&quot; (released in July 2001, re-released in 24 February 2003; #16 UK), &quot;Poor Leno&quot;, featuring Erlend Oye (released in 3 December 2001, re-released on 18 November 2002; #38 UK), &quot;Remind Me&quot;, featuring Erlend Oye (5 August 2002; #21 UK), and &quot;Sparks&quot;, featuring Anneli Drecker (2003; #41 UK). The band became famous for their original music videos (the infographic-styled video by French company H5 for the track &quot;Remind Me&quot;, won the 2002 MTV Europe Music Award for best music video). The single &quot;Eple&quot; (meaning &quot;apple&quot;) was used by Apple Inc. as the music for the startup video for Mac OS X 10. 3. In 4 July 2005, the band issued their sophomore album The Understanding on Wall of Sound. The album was preceded by the hit single &quot;Only This Moment&quot;, featuring Kate Havnevik (27 June 2005; #33 UK). Another four singles followed: &quot;49 Percent&quot; (26 September 2005; #55 UK), &quot;Curves&quot; (non-album single; 3 October 2005), &quot;What Else Is There?&quot;, featuring Karin Dreijer of The Knife (5 December 2005; #4 Norway, #32 UK) and &quot;Beautiful Day Without You&quot; (26 June 2006). Royksopp&#x27;s Night Out EP was released in 27 February 2006 and it contains live recordings from a concert in Norway, Rockefeller (Oslo) in November 2005. The album contains a new dance version of their single &quot;Sparks&quot; and a reinterpretation of the song &quot;Go With the Flow\", originally by Queens of the Stone Age. In 5 March 2007, the group issued Back to Mine: Royksopp , a compilation album from the Back to Mine series, compiled and mixed by the band. On 23 March 2009, Royksopp released their third album Junior on Wall of Sound. Royksopp have invited several guest artists, like Robyn, Anneli Drecker, Karin Dreijer, Lykke Li, to perform on various songs from Junior . The first single &quot;Happy Up Here&quot; was released on 19 January 2009 (digital)/16 March 2009 (vinyl) and peaked on #3 in Norway and on #44 in UK. Another two singles supported the album&#x27; sales: &quot;The Girl And The Robot&quot;, featuring Robyn (15 June 2009; #2 Norway) and &quot;This Must Be It&quot;, featuring Karin Dreijer (2 November 2009). Since 2010, the band started posting on their official site new exclusive songs available for free download (usually a song every month), known as Royksopp. com Track Of The Month . In 13 September 2010, Royksopp released the fourth album Senior , the atmospheric counterpart of Junior . The first single from the album, &quot;The Drug&quot;, was released on 9 August 2010. Official site: http://www. royksopp. com", "Lou Barlow": "Lou Barlow (born Louis Knox Barlow on July 17, 1966, in Dayton, Ohio) is an American alternative rock musician and songwriter. A founding member of the groups Deep Wound, Dinosaur Jr. , Sebadoh, and The Folk Implosion, Barlow, from a base in Western Mass-Boston in 1982, is credited with helping to pioneer the lo-fi style of rock music in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Though born in Dayton, Ohio, Barlow was raised in Jackson, Michigan and then Westfield, Massachusetts. He is widely considered to be among the most prolific and ground-breaking indie musicians of the 1990&#x27;s. He&#x27;s best known for his work with Sebadoh, The Folk Implosion and Dinosaur Jr. &#x27;s original and current lineup. Many labels have been applied to his unique brand of acoustic rock, including lo-fi, folk-pop and folkcore. Barlow&#x27;s latest album, his second official solo effort under his own name, is titled Goodnight unknown. ", "Kiss": "There are three groups of artists with this name: 1) KISS, American rock band 2) Kiss, Korean pop trio - kiseu or K. I. S. S. 3) Kiss, Taiwanese girl group KISS is an American hard rock band that formed in New York City, USA in 1973. The group has performed and recorded continuously since their formation. KISS has sold over 100 million albums worldwide and has been awarded 45 gold albums to date, and has certified sales of 19 million records in the U. S. Their latest album is 2012&#x27;s &#x27; Monster &#x27;. Easily identified by their trademark face paint (registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office) and stage costumes, KISS quickly rose to prominence on the basis of their elaborate live performances, which featured fire-breathing, blood spitting, smoking guitars and pyrotechnics. Inspired by energetic shock rock artists such as Alice Cooper and cult works of American horror and science fiction, they had their biggest commercial success in the 70s, influencing many later arena rock and heavy metal artists. They continue to play to a massive fan-base known as the &#x27;Kiss Army&#x27;. The original lineup of Gene Simmons (bass and vocals), Paul Stanley (rhythm guitar and vocals), Ace Frehley (lead guitar and vocals) and Peter Criss (drums and vocals) became the most successful and identifiable in the band&#x27;s history, and released a series of gold and platinum albums throughout the 1970s. Due to substance abuse problems and creative differences, both Peter Criss and Ace Frehley were out of the group by 1982. The band&#x27;s commercial fortunes had also waned considerably by that point. In 1983, KISS abandoned their makeup and enjoyed a commercial resurgence throughout the mid-to-late 1980s. They began to fall out of favor once again by the early 1990s, however. Buoyed by a wave of KISS nostalgia in the mid-1990s, the band announced a reunion of the original lineup (with makeup) in 1996. The resulting &quot;KISS Alive Worldwide&quot; tour was the top-grossing act of 1996. Criss and Frehley have since left KISS, and have been replaced by Eric Singer and Tommy Thayer, respectively. The band continues to perform, while Stanley and Simmons have remained the only two constant members. Early years and struggles (1972-75) KISS traces its roots to Wicked Lester, a New York-based rock and roll band led by co-founders Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley. Simmons (born Chaim Witz in Haifa, Israel on August 25, 1949) and Stanley (born Stanley Harvey Eisen in Queens, New York City on January 20, 1952) fired the other members of Wicked Lester in 1972 after Epic Records rejected an album recorded by the group. In late 1972, Simmons spotted an ad in Rolling Stone placed by Peter Criss, a drummer &quot;willing to do anything. &quot; Criss (born Peter Criscuola on December 20, 1945 in Brooklyn, New York City) auditioned for and joined Wicked Lester, now a trio. In January 1973 the group added lead guitarist Paul &quot;Ace&quot; Frehley (born April 27, 1951 in the Bronx, New York City) after being extremely impressed with his audition. That month, the Wicked Lester name was dropped and the band became KISS. Stanley is credited with coming up with the name and the logo, while Frehley came up with the idea of making the &quot;SS&quot; look like lightning bolts, because he said that it &quot;looked cool. &quot; The letters happened to look similar to the insignia of the Nazi SS, or Waffen-SS, a symbol that is now illegal to display in Germany. Therefore, in Germany, all of the band&#x27;s album covers and merchandise used a modified version of the logo, in which the &quot;SS&quot; looks like a backwards &quot;ZZ. &quot; The first KISS performance was on January 30, 1973, for an audience of three at the Popcorn Club (renamed Coventry shortly afterward) in Queens. In June of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer Eddie Kramer. After a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, former TV director Bill Aucoin offered to become the band's manager in mid-October. KISS agreed, with the condition that Aucoin get them signed to a recording contract within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, KISS became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and Buddha Records executive Neil Bogart&#x27;s new label, Emerald City Records (which was shortly afterward renamed Casablanca Records). The band entered Bell Sound Studios in New York City on October 10, 1973 to begin recording their first album. On December 31 the band had their official industry premier at the Academy of Music in New York City, opening for Blue Oyster Cult. It was at this concert that Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze while performing his inaugural fire-breathing stunt. KISS&#x27;s first major tour started on February 5, 1974 in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium. The band's self-titled debut album, KISS, was released on February 18. Casablanca and KISS promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974. On February 19, the band performed &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose,&quot; &quot;Firehouse&quot; and &quot;Black Diamond&quot; for what would become their first national television appearance, on ABC&#x27;s Dick Clark&#x27;s In Concert (aired March 29). On April 29, the band performed &quot;Firehouse&quot; on The Mike Douglas Show. This broadcast included Simmons&#x27;s first televised interview, a conversation with Douglas in which Simmons declared himself &quot;evil incarnate,&quot; eliciting titters from an uncomfortable and largely confused studio audience. The presence of the costumed, made-up Simmons on Douglas&#x27;s mid-afternoon, conservative talk show caused a palpable sense of tension in both the host and the audience, which Simmons seemed to enjoy as he intentionally exacerbated it by frequent exhibitions of tongue-flashing. This tension was then punctured by a spontaneous humorous exchange between Simmons and another of the show&#x27;s guests, comedienne Totie Fields, which caused Simmons to break character and laugh. The band flew to Los Angeles in August to begin recording their second album, Hotter Than Hell, which was released in on October 22, 1974. The only single, &quot;Let Me Go, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll,&quot; failed to chart and the album stalled at #100. With Hotter Than Hell quickly dropping off the charts, KISS was pulled from their tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca Records head Neil Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of Hotter Than Hell for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. Dressed To Kill, released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than Hotter Than Hell. It also contained what would later become the band&#x27;s trademark song, &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite. &quot; Although KISS albums had not proven to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation as a top-flight live act. KISS concerts featured things such as Simmons spitting &quot;blood&quot; (primarily yogurt and food coloring) or &quot;breathing fire&quot; (spitting flammable liquid at a torch); Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar); Criss&#x27;s elevating drum riser that emitted sparks; Stanley&#x27;s Townshend-style guitar smashing; and pyrotechnics throughout the show. By late 1975, Casablanca was nearly bankrupt and KISS was in danger of losing their record contract. Both parties desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive. That breakthrough came in an unlikely form - a double live album. Success (1975-78) KISS attempted to express the excitement felt at their live shows (which their studio albums had so far failed to do), with their next album. Released on September 10, 1975, Alive!, would go on to achieve quadruple platinum status, and spawned KISS&#x27;s first top 40 single, a live version of &quot;Rock And Roll All Nite. &quot; It was the first version of &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite&quot; with a guitar solo, and this recording has come to represent the definitive version of the song; supplanting the studio original. The success of Alive! not only brought KISS the breakthrough they had been seeking, but arguably saved Casablanca. Following this success, KISS partnered with producer Bob Ezrin, who had previously worked with Alice Cooper. The result was Destroyer (released March 15, 1976), KISS&#x27;s most musically ambitious studio album to date. While the album sold well initially, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the power ballad &quot;Beth&quot; was released as a single did the album&#x27;s fortunes rebound. &quot;Beth&quot; was a #7 hit for the band, and its success revived album and ticket sales for KISS. Destroyer, with its rather intricate production, was a departure from the rawer sound of the first three studio albums. Despite this, the album is now considered by many fans to be the band&#x27;s finest, and many of the songs from Destroyer remain KISS concert staples to this day. In October 1976, KISS made an appearance on the The Paul Lynde Halloween Special, lip-synching &quot;Detroit Rock City,&quot; &quot;Beth&quot; and &quot;King of the Night Time World. &quot; For many teenagers, this was their first exposure to KISS&#x27;s dramatic appearance. The show was co-produced by KISS manager Bill Aucoin. In addition to the three songs, KISS was the subject of a brief comedic &quot;interview&quot; conducted by Paul Lynde himself. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member&#x27;s names, &quot;Oh, I love a good religious group. &quot; A 1977 Gallup poll named KISS the most popular band in America. In Japan, KISS broke attendance records previously held by the Beatles. KISS merchandise became a huge source of income for the group. Some of the products released were two comic books released by Marvel, pinball machines, Mego dolls, &quot;KISS Your Face Makeup&quot; kits, Halloween masks, board games and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the KISS Army, the band&#x27;s fan club, was in the six figures. As the dominant music format of the time, vinyl album releases by the band were considered collectors&#x27; items, as they frequently contained collectable merchandise ranging from photo booklets (for the live releases), full length posters and stickers to removable tattoos. Two more highly successful studio albums were released in less than a year: November 11, 1976&#x27;s Rock and Roll Over and June 30, 1977&#x27;s Love Gun. The band had recorded their first live album after their first three studio albums; and they had now released three studio albums since Alive!. So, right on schedule, they released the sequel to Alive! on November 29, 1977, titled Alive II. Alive II was a double album, as the first live album had been. But this album had three live sides with a fourth side of newly recorded studio material. Kramer continued as producer for Alive II, this time co-credited along with the band. On the newly recorded songs, Frehley was replaced by Bob Kulick (who auditioned for KISS but lost out to Frehley) on four of the five tracks. Frehley played only on the song he wrote and sang, &quot;Rocket Ride&quot;. However, Kulick was instructed by Simmons and Stanley to try to sound as much like Frehley as he could. The first of what is now many KISS greatest hits albums, titled Double Platinum, was issued on April 2, 1978. This double album included many remixed versions of their hits, non-hits, and &quot;Strutter &#x27;78,&quot; a newly recorded version of the popular song, using a drum machine to cash in on the Disco sound, from the band&#x27;s first album. Going solo (1978) Flushed with the success of Love Gun and its subsequent tour, KISS and creative manager Bill Aucoin sought to take the band to the next level of popularity. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978. The first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of KISS. While each album was very much a solo effort, they were all released and marketed as KISS albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time in history that all current members of a rock and roll band had released solo albums at the same time. For the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of KISS, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists (Simmons&#x27;s album featured appearances by the likes of Aerosmith&#x27;s Joe Perry, Cheap Trick&#x27;s Rick Nielsen, disco diva Donna Summer, and then-girlfriend Cher). Stanley&#x27;s and Frehley&#x27;s stuck pretty closely to the successful hard rock style that KISS had utilized. Criss&#x27;s album featured an R&amp;B style and was loaded with ballads, while Simmons&#x27;s was the most eclectic of the four. It featured hard rock, ballads, Beatles-influenced pop and ended with a straight cover of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; (from Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;). The KISS solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. The marketing blitz behind the albums was unprecedented - Casablanca announced it was shipping five million total copies of the albums (guaranteeing instant platinum status), and they spent US$2. 5 million marketing them. Despite all four solo albums making it into the Top 50 of the Billboard album chart, the massive preorder for these albums was soon followed by a just as enormous attempt to ship them back to the record company, followed by the subsequent discounting of these albums once sales had (very quickly) peaked. All four albums combined sold about as many copies as Love Gun alone had. The albums were also the first KISS albums to be seen in the &quot;bargain bins&quot; of many record stores, and it was the first clear harbinger of KISS&#x27;s waning popularity. Of the four, Frehley&#x27;s album was the most successful (although not by a huge margin) and spawned the only radio top 20 hit (Russ Ballard&#x27;s composition &quot;New York Groove&quot;). The second part of KISS&#x27;s and Aucoin&#x27;s plan called for the band to appear in a movie that would cement their image as larger than life superheroes. Filming for the movie, entitled KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park, commenced in the spring of 1978. The film was proposed to the band as a cross between A Hard Day&#x27;s Night and Star Wars, though the final results fell far short of these expectations. The script underwent numerous rewrites, and the band (particularly Criss and Frehley) grew increasingly frustrated with the process. Criss refused to take part in post-production, and so his entire voice track was completely over-dubbed by another actor. The picture was reportedly filmed completely out of proper frame by the cinematographer, resulting in much of what was supposed to be on screen missing from the final product. Also, the film employed stunt doubles for KISS who were physically dissimilar to the band members themselves, which is obvious in several scenes. In some instances, Frehley was replaced by an African American stunt double in Spaceman makeup and costume, as Stanley pointed out in VH1&#x27;s &quot;KISS: Beyond the Make-Up. &quot; The movie, produced by Hanna-Barbera, aired on NBC on October 28, 1978. Despite scathing reviews, it was one of the highest-rated TV movies of the year, and saw theatrical release outside the U. S. in 1979 under the title Attack of the Phantoms. While later interviews with band members would have them talk about their movie making experience with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret as to the finished product, their unhappiness with the final product was well-known to those around them. They felt that the movie ended up portraying them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the movie led to the a rift between the band and Aucoin, who they blamed for it. Late makeup years (1979-83) The band&#x27;s first album of new material in two years, Dynasty (May 23, 1979), continued their platinum streak. The album contained what would become the biggest single in the history of the band, the worldwide smash &quot;I Was Made For Lovin&#x27; You. &quot; The song, which combined elements of the KISS sound with disco, was a top ten hit throughout the world (although stateside, it only managed number 11) and stands as the most covered KISS song ever. In Australia, the song became what is believed to be Kiss&#x27; only No 1 hit anywhere, paving the way for a follow up Top 10 hit, &quot;Sure Know Something&quot; and a sellout tour the following year. This album, as well as the follow-up, Unmasked, were recorded using ghost drummer Anton Fig (later of the Late Night with David Letterman/Late Show with David Letterman band) at the request of producer Vini Poncia, who felt that Criss&#x27;s drumming skills were not adequate. The only contribution made by the increasingly discontented Criss to Dynasty was &quot;Dirty Livin&#x27;&quot;, which he co-wrote and sang. The tour for Dynasty in 1979 saw once-sold-out arenas being replaced with half- to three-fourths-filled venues, and even a two night homecoming in July 1979 at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden did not see the usual full houses, leaving the New York Daily News to wonder aloud if this was to be &quot;The Last Monster Mash. &quot; Although the audiences who did show up were for the most part as enthusiastic as ever, reviews of these shows were mixed, as visible tensions within the band began taking their toll on the quality of the music. As further evidence of bad blood within the band, fans point to an October 31, 1979 interview of the band on Tom Snyder&#x27;s late night The Tomorrow Show, where a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley, as well as a bored Criss, all but walk out on a bombastic Frehley, whose infectious but over-the-top laughter overshadow the content and conversation that takes place between harried interviewer Snyder and the rest of the band. This offbeat interview, where KISS looked completely uncomfortable together, would prove to be the last appearance the original line-up of KISS would make on television for almost twenty years. However, these disagreements were hardly noticed by KISS&#x27;s new fan base. The crowds were very much younger than previous audiences had been, with many pre-adolescent children in KISS makeup with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the makeup themselves!) in tow at most concerts. KISS themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans. At this point, the problems and disagreements within the band took their toll. Criss, not happy with the change in the group&#x27;s fan base and wrestling with his own feelings about the band&#x27;s current direction (not to mention his increasing substance abuse issues), left the band shortly after the May 20, 1980 release of Unmasked. Criss appeared in the music video for the song &quot;Shandi&quot;, but did not contribute in any way to the recording of the album. Despite a slick, contemporary pop sound, Unmasked had the dubious distinction of being the first KISS album since Dressed to Kill to fail to go platinum. The tour to support Unmasked never reached the U. S. , save for a one-off show at New York&#x27;s now defunct Palladium Theatre to showcase new drummer Eric Carr (born Paul Caravello on June 12, 1950 in Brooklyn, New York City; died November 24, 1991). The band&#x27;s 1980 tour of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in their history, as they played to sold-out crowds and enjoyed enormous popularity amongst the fans there. For their next album, the band once again approached Bob Ezrin, with whom KISS had found success on Destroyer. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. What was released instead was 1981&#x27;s (Music from) The Elder, a concept album featuring medieval horns, strings, harps, synthesizers and Gregorian Chant-style vocalizing. The album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult (if not impossible) to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback from their record company&#x27;s preview of the album, KISS altered the record&#x27;s track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles &quot;The Oath&quot; and &quot;A World Without Heroes,&quot; which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already muddled storyline. Although the band presented a mystical, progressive rock sound on the LP, their appearance took on an incongruous &quot;new wave&quot; look, with short and spiky hairdos, and simplified black-spandex costumes. Once released, fan reaction to The Elder was equally harsh; it failed to go gold and couldn&#x27;t climb past number 75 on the Billboard Album Chart. Frehley, upset with the band&#x27;s decision to record a concept album, did not actively participate in the album&#x27;s creation. He literally &quot;mailed in&quot; his only contributions, the songs &quot;Escape From The Island&quot; and &quot;Dark Light. &quot; KISS did not perform any of the music from this album in their concerts until their subsequent &quot;Unplugged&quot; reunion fifteen years later. However, the band appeared on the ABC late-night variety program Fridays in January of 1982 and performed three songs from the album: &quot;The Oath&quot;, &quot;A World Without Heroes&quot;, and &quot;I&quot;. Four leftover songs from a planned &quot;heavier&quot; album were combined with classic KISS material from the 1970s for the May 10, 1982 release Killers, a compilation album released outside the United States. Bob Kulick played on the four newer songs, again being instructed to replicate Frehley&#x27;s style as closely as possible. The band soon made major changes to their business dealings, severing ties with their manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on their unwieldy organizational tree. By this time Frehley had already decided to leave the band, but Simmons and Stanley needed for their record company to believe that Frehley was still in KISS in order for the band to keep its contract. So to keep up appearances they included him in the original cover art of their next album, 1982&#x27;s Creatures of the Night, although Frehley did not play a note on it. This album was the heaviest album the band had released up to that point. In Frehley&#x27;s absence, KISS utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of Creatures, including Steve Ferris, Bob Kulick and Vincent Cusano (who would soon be known as Vinnie Vincent). The album featured tracks co-written by Adam Mitchell (who worked with KISS again in 1987), Canadian singer/songwriter Bryan Adams (who had also co-written a song on Killers) and his writing partner Jim Vallance. In a situation similar to that of Criss on Unmasked, Frehley appears in the music video for the song &quot;I Love It Loud,&quot; despite not having played on the track. Creatures of the Night fared better than (Music From) The Elder, yet it couldn&#x27;t make it past number 45 on the charts and was not certified gold until 1994. The day after shooting the video for the song &quot;I Love It Loud,&quot; Frehley officially left the band and was replaced permanently by Vinnie Vincent (born Vincent Cusano on August 6, 1952) in time for the band&#x27;s &quot;10th Anniversary&quot; tour. Vincent&#x27;s hurriedly-developed identity was that of an Egyptian warrior (with a gold ankh painted on his face), although he would not need this persona for very long. While the tour was a commercial disappointment in the US, the band did go on to play for the largest crowds of their career elsewhere, including up to 203,000 fans in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on June 18, 1983. The Rio show was one of the last concerts KISS would perform in makeup until June 21, 1996. Unmasking (1983-95) Sensing it was time for a change, KISS appeared in public without makeup for the first time with a September 18, 1983 appearance on MTV. The appearance coincided with the release of the band&#x27;s new album, Lick It Up. The album cover featured the band, without their trademark makeup, photographed against a plain white background. However, in a possible signal to their fans that KISS would still be KISS, Simmons still allowed his trademark tongue to wag. Lick It Up became their first gold record in three years, and the band successfully toured the US for the first time since 1979 (albeit in smaller venues). Due to quickly rising tensions between Vincent and the rest of KISS (particularly Simmons and Stanley), Vincent was fired after the Lick It Up tour. Mark St. John (born Mark Norton on February 7, 1956 in Hollywood, California), replaced Vincent. His rapid, &quot;shredding&quot; technique was very much in favor at the time. Animalize (1984) built on the success of Lick It Up and was the band&#x27;s best-selling record during the decade. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, KISS had clearly recaptured their niche (though not to the level of their &#x27;70s heyday). &quot;Heaven&#x27;s on Fire&quot; saw heavy airplay on MTV. St. John, however, was soon taken ill with Reiter&#x27;s syndrome and left the band shortly into the 1984 Animalize tour. Bruce Kulick (born December 12, 1953 in Brooklyn, New York City) became KISS&#x27;s new lead guitarist, and would remain with the group for the next 12 years. For the rest of the 1980s, KISS turned out a series of best-selling albums: 1985&#x27;s Asylum, 1987&#x27;s Crazy Nights and the 1988 greatest hits compilation Smashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits. &quot;Crazy, Crazy Nights&quot; from the Crazy Nights album hit #4 on the singles chart in Britain, where it is KISS&#x27; highest charting single behind their Australian #1 in 1979. Smashes, Thrashes &amp; Hits contained a controversial re-recording of the lead vocal to &quot;Beth. &quot; The song, long a trademark of original drummer Peter Criss, now featured lead vocals by Eric Carr. KISS ended the &#x27;80s with the 1989 release Hot in the Shade. Although the album failed to achieve platinum status, it spawned the early 1990 hit ballad &quot;Forever,&quot; co-written by Michael Bolton. Peaking at #8, it was the group&#x27;s highest-charting single since &quot;I Was Made For Lovin&#x27; You&quot; and would be the band&#x27;s last Top 10 single. During these non-makeup years, KISS struggled with their identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the dominating force in KISS during the &#x27;70s, became less involved with the group in the &#x27;80s as he pursued outside interests; most notably, a film career. After the band&#x27;s unmasking, he struggled with the loss of the Demon persona. During this time, Stanley became the dominant force in KISS. In an attempt to distance themselves from their comic-book superhero image of the 1970&#x27;s, KISS began to position themselves as more of an adult-oriented band, as is evidenced by their use of adult language and sexual promiscuity on concert videos such as KISS: Animalize Live Uncensored and the bawdy &quot;home tour&quot; in KISS - Exposed. The band decided to once again enlist Bob Ezrin to produce their first album of the 1990s. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In September 1990, Eric Carr was hospitalized after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. While hospitalized, it was discovered that he had cancer of the heart. He died on November 24, 1991 at the age of 41 (incidentally, the same day as Freddie Mercury). Though devastated, KISS continued, bringing in former Black Sabbath, Gary Moore, Lita Ford, and Alice Cooper drummer Eric Singer (born Eric Mensinger on May 12, 1958 in Cleveland, Ohio). Singer had also been in the band that Stanley put together for a 1989 club tour. KISS released their critically acclaimed Revenge on May 18, 1992. it featured a leaner, harder-edged sound, as indicated by the first single, &quot;Unholy. &quot; In a surprise move, KISS enlisted the aid of Vinnie Vincent for songwriting duties. The album debuted in the Top 10 and went gold. KISS &quot;tuned up&quot; for a major tour with many small club dates throughout the U. S. , where they supported Revenge and were able to be seen in intimate settings for the first time since the early days of the band. KISS followed Revenge with the release of Alive III on May 14, 1993. Four days later, on May 18, 1993, KISS was inducted into the RockWalk of Fame, at Guitar Center on Hollywood&#x27;s Sunset Boulevard. RockWalk inductions are voted on by previous RockWalk inductees, making this truly a musician&#x27;s award, rather than a critic&#x27;s award. During this period, KISS nostalgia started to pick up steam. In June 1994, the band issued KISS My Ass, a compilation album featuring popular artists of the era putting their own spin on KISS songs. The result was an eclectic mix of sounds, ranging from Lenny Kravitz putting a funky stamp on &quot;Deuce&quot; (with Stevie Wonder on harmonica), a ska version of &quot;Detroit Rock City&quot; by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, to Garth Brooks&#x27; straightforward take on &quot;Hard Luck Woman,&quot; with KISS themselves as his backup band. In 1995, the band embarked on a unique and well-received &quot;Worldwide KISS Convention Tour. &quot; The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage KISS stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia, performances by KISS cover bands, and dealers selling KISS merchandise from every stage of the band&#x27;s career up to that time. KISS appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs and performed a two-hour acoustic set comprised mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U. S. date, June 17, 1995, Peter Criss appeared onstage with KISS to sing on &quot;Hard Luck Woman&quot; and on &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose. &quot; It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years. On August 9, 1995, KISS joined the long line of musicians to perform on MTV Unplugged. The band contacted Criss and Frehley and invited them to participate in the event. Both joined KISS onstage for several songs at the end of the set: &quot;Beth,&quot; &quot;2000 Man,&quot; &quot;Nothin&#x27; to Lose&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll All Nite. &quot; The Unplugged appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original KISS lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the Unplugged concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer), returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record Carnival of Souls. The album was completed, but its release was delayed for two years. Bootleg copies of the album circulated widely among fans. While KISS continued to exist publicly as Simmons, Stanley, Kulick and Singer, arrangements for a reunion of the original lineup were in the works. These efforts culminated with a public event as dramatic as any the band had staged since their 1983 unmasking on MTV. Reunion (1996-2002)  &quot;You know how the Grammys used to be, all straight-looking folks with suits. Everybody looking tired. No surprises. We tired of that. We need something new &#8230;&quot; With that statement on February 28, 1996, the late Tupac Shakur introduced the original KISS lineup (clad in full makeup and Love Gun era stage outfits), to a rousing ovation at the 38th Annual Grammy Awards. On April 16, the band held a press conference aboard the USS Intrepid in New York, where they announced their plans for a full-fledged reunion tour, with the help of manager Doc McGhee. The conference, emceed by Conan O&#x27;Brien, was simulcast to 58 countries. The first public concert featuring the newly reunited KISS was an hour-long warm up show on June 21st for KROQ&#x27;s 4th annual Weenie Roast in Irvine, CA. During the show the band nearly ignited the stage of the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. On June 28, the &quot;KISS Alive Worldwide&quot; tour officially kicked off at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan in front of a sold-out crowd of 39,867 fans. Tickets for the show sold out in 45 minutes. The tour earned $43. 6 million, making KISS the top-drawing concert act of 1996. In September 1998, the reunited group issued Psycho Circus. Despite the appearance as the first album with the original lineup since 1977&#x27;s Love Gun, once again the contributions of Frehley and Criss were minimal. While the images of Frehley and Criss are featured prominently on the album, most of the lead guitar work was later revealed to have been performed by future band member Tommy Thayer and former member Bruce Kulick. Most drum duties were handled by session musician Kevin Valentine. Despite the controversy, the album achieved a #3 chart debut, the highest ever position for a KISS album. The title track received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The Psycho Circus tour opened at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles, California on Halloween night 1998, and was simulcast on FM radio across the US. It proved to be another success, and was historic for being the first to ever incorporate 3-D visuals into a stage show. On August 11, 1999, KISS was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, in the &quot;Recording Industry&quot; category. August 13, 1999 saw the nationwide premiere of a KISS-themed motion picture titled Detroit Rock City. The movie was set in 1978, focusing on four teenagers (featuring Edward Furlong) willing to do anything to score tickets for a sold-out KISS show in Detroit. The quartet announced in the spring of 2000 that they would be launching a U. S. Farewell tour in the summer, which became one of the year&#x27;s top concert draws. The same year also saw the release of a computer game, &quot;KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child. &quot; But on the eve of a Japanese and Australian tour in early 2001, Criss suddenly left the band once again, reportedly unhappy with his salary. Taking his place was previous KISS drummer Singer, who, in a controversial move among longtime fans, donned Criss&#x27;s Cat Man makeup as the &quot;Farewell Tour&quot; continued. (Simmons and Stanley own both Frehley&#x27;s and Criss&#x27;s makeup designs, so there was no way for Criss to prevent this. ) With the band scheduled to call it a day supposedly by late 2001, a career-encompassing Box Set (94 tracks over five discs) was released in November, while the summer saw perhaps the most over-the-top piece of KISS merchandise yet &ndash; the KISS Kasket. The group was relatively quiet through the rest of the year, but 2002 started with a bang as Simmons turned in an entertaining and controversial interview on National Public Radio where he criticized NPR and berated host Terry Gross with sexual comments and condescending answers. He was promoting his autobiography at the time, which also caused dissension in the KISS camp because of the inflammatory remarks made towards Frehley. Frehley was quite angry at the situation, leading to his no-show at an American Bandstand anniversary show. Discography: KISS (1974) Hotter Than Hell (1974) Dressed to Kill (1975) Alive!

Kiss (kiseu or K. I. S. S. ) was a Korean female pop trio. Their debut single &quot;Because I&#x27;m a Girl&quot; was a hit in 2001. The music video stars actress Goo Hye-jin, and actor Shin Hyun-joon, which increased initial public interest in the song. The song remained a karaoke staple in Korea for many years. This helped to launch the career of Kiss, with an album quickly following. However, the group quickly disbanded afterwards, due to internal conflict that could not be resolved. &quot;Because I&#x27;m a Girl&quot; has been covered by numerous artists, including Korean female duo 2NB. 3) Kiss (was a short lived Taiwanese group made up of three girls, Cai Pei Lin (Cai Pei Lin ), Zhang Shuo Fen (Zhang Shuo Fen ) and Wang Tingxuan (Wang Ting Xuan ), in the late 90's early 2000. They only released one full length album (Let&#x27;s Wait and See), and one CD single (Shut Up). ", "Raul Seixas": "Raul Santos Seixas (born June 28, 1945 -- August 21, 1989), was a Brazilian rock composer, singer, songwriter and producer. He is sometimes called the &quot;Father of Brazilian Rock&quot; and &quot;Maluco Beleza&quot;. He was born in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil, and died of pancreatitis in Sao Paulo. Every year on Seixas&#x27; birthday, legions of fans, including hundreds of impersonators (many even changing their last name to Seixas as a sign of idolatry), throw a parade in his honor in downtown Sao Paulo. His body of work consists of 21 albums released along his 26-year career. His musical style is mostly rock and ballad, although he wrote songs in many different styles, including variations of styles typical of his native Northeastern Brazil like Forro and Baiao, and in fact often used more than one style in the same song, as in &quot;Let Me Sing, Let Me Sing&quot;. His debut album, Raulzito e Os Panteras (1968), was produced when he was part of a band of the same name. However, he only gained prominence and critical audience with songs from the album Krig-Ha, Bandolo! (1973), such as &quot;Ouro de Tolo&quot; (&quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot;), &quot;Mosca na Sopa&quot; (&quot;Fly in the Soup&quot;), and &quot;Metamorfose Ambulante&quot; (&quot;Walking Metamorphosis&quot;). Raul Seixas developed a unique musical style that emphasized the maverick and the mystic. His album Gita (1974), influenced by figures such as Aleister Crowley, expresses his views very directly. Many songs in Gita were co-written with his frequent collaborator, then fellow mystic, and future worldwide bestselling author Paulo Coelho. Raul was interested in philosophy (especially metaphysics and ontology), psychology, history, literature and Latin. In October 2008, nineteen years after his death, Raul Seixas was placed in 19th position in a List of One Hundred Greatest Artists of Brazilian music sponsored by the Brazilian edition of Rolling Stone magazine, topping the likes of Milton Nascimento, Maria Bethania, Heitor Villa-Lobos and others, demonstrating the influence that Seixas&#x27; music continues to hold today. ", "PJ Harvey": "PJ Harvey is an abbreviation of singer-songwriter Polly Jean Harvey (b. 9 Oct 1969 in Yeovil and raised in nearby Corscombe, Dorset, England) and a name of two acts. First was a Harvey -led trio, formed in 1991 with Rob Ellis (drums) and Steve Vaughan (bass), which debuted with Dry (Mar 1992). Overlapping with the trio, Harvey reused the name for solo work, inaugurated by 4-Track Demos (Oct 1993). The trio broke up in 1995 and Harvey continued solo - her latest album is Let England Shake (Feb 2011). The trio&#x27;s material on Dry and Rid of Me was praised by critics for its raw, guitar-driven sound and sharp-witted, melancholic lyrics. After the trio broke up, in 1995, Harvey released To Bring You My Love , a blues-heavy album that expanded the range of her sound through the incorporation of strings, organs, and electronic sound effects. Her stage show became more theatrical, with Harvey performing in ballgowns, pink catsuits, wigs and garish, vampish make-up. Never one to rest, she followed this album with the softer, more experimental Is This Desire? , released in 1998, and then Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea , released in 2000, which combined her more guitar-driven work with cleaner, lusher arrangements. Stories won her the 2001 Mercury Prize. In 2004 she released Uh Huh Her , a return to her earlier, rawer sound. Uh Huh Her was met with a somewhat mixed response; while some critics welcomed Harvey&#x27;s re-exploration of her previous styles, others felt that the album was something of a rehash. Around the same time, she produced and co-wrote half of Marianne Faithfull&#x27;s album Before the Poison , which received much critical praise. Apparently the result of writer&#x27;s block (according to reports made by the BBC), 2007&#x27;s White Chalk saw Harvey exploring new territory. Jettisoning her trademark guitar-driven sound, White Chalk was a collection of eerie, skeletal piano ballads; Harvey received widespread praise for the album. In 2011, Harvey released the album Let England Shake , in which she explored war-related themes, using Britain&#x27;s involvement in World War I as a historical backdrop. The album received widespread critical acclaim and won Harvey her second Mercury Prize; to date, she is the only person to win the prize more than once. PJ Harvey has collaborated with a number of other artists, including: Nick Cave, Thom Yorke, Bjork, John Parish, Tricky, Sparklehorse, Pascal Comelade and Mark Lanegan. She has also been a collaborator in the Desert Sessions, along with Josh Homme, Jeordie White, Dave Catching, Nick Oliveri, Mark Lanegan, Chris Goss, Alain Johannes and Dean Ween. ", "Melanie Martinez": "Melanie Martinez (born in 1995 in Baldwin, New York, United States) is an American singer, known for her participation in The Voice Season 3 (2012). During the blind audition, she wowed Blake Shelton, Adam Levine, and Cee Lo Green with her indie folk take on a classic Britney Spears&#x27; hit, \"Toxic\", and ended up picking Adam Levine as her coach. An avid photographer, Melanie enjoys immersing herself in artistic endeavors that make her stand out from the norm. She was inspired by her grandmother to start singing. As hoped, The Voice allowed her to enrich her musical abilities, while gaining a large fan-base known as the &quot;Little Bows&quot; (so named because of her use of bows during performaces). http://melaniemartinezmusic. com http://twitter. com/MelanieLBBH", "Zedd": "Zedd is a Grammy-award winning electro-house DJ and record producer from Kaiserslautern, Germany. Born Anton Zaslavski, he was surrounded by a family of musicians, he began playing the piano at the age of four. After several years of learning to master the piano, Anton began playing the drums in a band, and composed and produced numerous rocksongs in his band&#x27;s own studio. In 2009 he began producing electronic clubmusic, to much and quick acclaim. After a period of only few months he attained a remarkable level and participated in Beatport&#x27;s &quot;Armand Van Helden / Strictly Rhythm Remix Contest&quot;, which he went on to win. This opened up a number of new possibilities for Zedd, and only shortly after, he won his second contest on Beatport, the &quot;Fatboy Slim / Skint Remix Contest&quot;! This was the foundation for several cooperations with artists such as Black Eyed Peas, Lady Gaga, P. Diddy, Skrillex, Fatboy Slim, Armand Van Helden and labels like mau5trap, Interscope, Atlantic, Strictly Rhythm or Skint Records. His first release &quot;The Anthem&quot; entered the Beatport charts top 20, and even made it to the second place of Track It Down charts. His remix for Skrillex&#x27; &#x27;Scary Monsters And Nice Sprites&#x27;, released on &#x27;mau5trap recordings&#x27; climbed up the charts to #4 on Beatport and #2 on Beatport&#x27;s Electro House charts. Zedd released his single &quot;Shave It&quot; on October 4th 2011 via Beatport under Skrillex&#x27;s new label OWSLA. &quot;Shave It&quot; is Zedd&#x27;s first single with OWSLA. One of the reasons for this rapid development is undoubtedly Zedd&#x27;s unique and highly recognizable style of composition. It stands out as very detailed and carefully produced Electro House, very playful and the same time remarkably catchy. Zedd is definitely an artist to look out for in the future&#8230;", "The Paper Kites": "The Paper Kites are an indie folk band from Melbourne, consisting of Sam Bentley (from Best Before), Christina Lacy, Dave Powys, Sam Rasmussen and Josh Bentley.

The band consists of Panda Bear (Noah Lennox), Avey Tare (David Portner), Deakin (Josh Dibb) and Geologist (Brian Weitz). Records released under the name Animal Collective may include contributions from any or all of these members; the lineup is not uniform. The band has released nine albums: &quot;Spirit They&#x27;re Gone, Spirit They&#x27;ve Vanished&quot; (2000), &quot;Danse Manatee&quot; (2001), &quot;Campfire Songs&quot; (2003), &quot;Here Comes the Indian&quot; (2003), &quot;Sung Tongs&quot; (2004), &quot;Feels&quot; (2005), &quot;Strawberry Jam&quot; (2007), &quot;Merriweather Post Pavilion&quot; (2009) and &quot;Centipede Hz&quot; (2012).

The band members met in school and started recording together in various forms of collaboration from a young age. Although the band is often classified as psych folk or noise rock, it is hard to define the Animal Collective sound as they often experiment with diverse styles and ideas from album to album. The group also runs the record label Paw Tracks on which they have released their own material as well as material by artists such as Ariel Pink, Terrestrial Tones, and The Peppermints. Paw Tracks&#x27; latest signee is Tickley Feather, with whom the band recently toured.

The band also varies guests on their debut album such as the Crouch End Festival Chorus and The Wired Strings. Since his split from Oasis in August 2009, many speculated that Gallagher might record a solo album. In July 2011, he held a press conference to confirm that this was the case, after denying rumours made by his brother, Liam Gallagher, that he had already heard the tracks featured. He also explained that he would be collaborating with Amorphous Androgynous for an album that is due for release in the summer of 2012. ", "Wind & Fire": "Earth, Wind &amp; Fire is an American funk band, formed in Chicago, Illinois in 1969. Led by Maurice White, they are best known for their hits of the 1970s, among them &quot;After the Love Has Gone&quot;, &quot;September,&quot; &quot;Reasons,&quot; &quot;Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Shining Star. &quot; Earth, Wind &amp; Fire became the first black performers to headline throughout the world without an opening act, to receive Madison Square Garden&#x27;s Gold Ticket Award for selling more than 100,000 tickets and to receive the Columbia Records Crystal Globe Award for selling more than five million albums in foreign markets. They have gained the BET&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement Award and ASCAP&#x27;s Rhythm &amp; Soul Heritage Award. EW&amp;F was disbanded in 1983, but in 1987 CBS Records convinced Philip Bailey and Maurice White to reunite the group. The group managed to continue into the 90&#x27;s with releases such as &quot;Heritage&quot;,&quot;Millennium&quot;,and &quot;In the Name of Love &quot; in 1997. However, due to Parkinson&#x27;s Disease, Maurice retired from the road but still continued to produce and sing on the group&#x27;s recordings. In 2000, the original &#x27;70s edition of Earth, Wind &amp; Fire reunited for one night only in honor of their induction into The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame. The documentary entitled &#x27;Earth, Wind &amp; Fire: Shining Stars&#x27;, which contains rarely seen historic video footage along with in-depth interviews with the band members was released in 2001 While not as prolific as in their &#x27;70&#x27;s heyday, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire released &quot;The Promise&quot; in 2003 and the criticially acclaimed &quot;Illumination&quot;, which featured current contemporary r&amp; b guests such as Will I Am, Rafael Saddiq, and Brian McKnight.

While still touring, Philip Bailey, Ralph Johnson and Maurice&#x27;s brother, Verdine White remain as the group&#x27;s only original members. ", "System of a Down": "System of a Down is an Armenian American alternative metal band, formed in 1994 in Los Angeles, California, USA. All four members are of Armenian descent, and are widely known for their outspoken views expressed in many of their songs confronting the Armenian Genocide of 1915 by the Ottoman Empire and the ongoing War on Terror by the US government. The band consists of Serj Tankian (vocals), Daron Malakian (vocals, guitar), Shavo Odadjian (bass, vocals) and John Dolmayan (drums). System of a Down has achieved commercial success with five albums, and many singles such as their breakout hit &quot;Chop Suey!&quot;, &quot;Toxicity&quot;, &quot;Aerials&quot;, &quot;B. Y. O. B. &quot;, &quot;Question!&quot;, &quot;Hypnotize&quot; and &quot;Lonely Day&quot;. Their works have earned them one Grammy Award amongst three nominations. The band has been influenced by heavy metal, punk rock and Armenian folk. System of a Down went on hiatus in 2006, with Serj Tankian pursuing a solo career and Daron Malakian and John Dolmayan forming Scars on Broadway. Shavo joined together with RZA from the Wu-Tang clan to form Hip-Hop group Achozen. System of a Down is a part of the Axis of Justice, a non-profit organization formed by band member Serj Tankian (along with Tom Morello of Rage Against The Machine), dedicated to bringing together musicians, music fans, and grassroots political organizations to fight for social justice. Soil (1993-1995) The roots of System of a Down lie in the band Soil (not to be confused with the current band SOiL), a group from Los Angeles that included Serj Tankian on vocals/keyboard, and Daron Malakian on vocals/guitar, as well as Dave Hakopyan (Bassist for Mt. Helium) on bass and Domingo Laranio (Local Hawaii Drummer) on drums. Shavo Odadjian joined Soil near their end as a guitarist. After three years, only one live show, and one jam session recording, the band split up. In the beginning (1995-1997) After Soil split up, Serj and Daron formed a new band, System of a Down, based on a poem that Daron wrote. The poem&#x27;s title was &quot;Victims of the Down&quot;, but Shavo Odadjian, who was originally the band&#x27;s manager and promoter, didn&#x27;t like the word and thought the word &quot;System&quot; sounded better. Ever since Shavo joined as bassist, managerial duties have been undertaken by the Velvet Hammer Music and Management Group and founder David &quot;Beno&quot; Benveniste. The band then found a drummer, Andy Khachaturian. System of a Down quickly made what is known as their early Untitled 1995 Demo Tape, which had very early recordings of &quot;Mr. Jack&quot; (called &quot;PIG&quot;), along with songs called &quot;Flake&quot;, &quot;Toast&quot; and an early recording of &quot;The Metro&quot;, a cover of the Berlin song of the same name. It is rumored that there are other tapes made, which contain early recordings of &quot;Friik&quot;, &quot;36&quot; (called &quot;. 36&quot;), and &quot;Roulette&quot;. Two other songs, &quot;X&quot; (called &quot;Multiply&quot;) and &quot;Honey&quot; were live demos at the time and were played at very early shows. After this, the band recorded Demo Tape 1, which had early versions of &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Suite-Pee&quot;, and &quot;P. L. U. C. K. &quot;, as well as &quot;Dam. &quot; Demo Tape 2 was released in 1996 and had a rough demo of the song &quot;Soil&quot; as well as the most known unreleased tracks such as &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;Temper. &quot; At the beginning of 1997, SOAD recorded their final publicly-released demo tape, Demo Tape 3, which had rough versions of &quot;Peephole&quot;, &quot;War?&quot;, and &quot;Know. &quot; In mid 1997, Ontronik Khachaturian left the band due to a hand injury. Soon after playing at the Whisky-A-Go-Go and Viper Room with new drummer John Dolmayan, producer Rick Rubin caught the band&#x27;s attention and told them to keep in touch with him. Showing great interest, they recorded Demo Tape 4 near the end of that year. This demo, however, was made only to be sent to record companies. The tape was not released to the public until years later when it was leaked onto the Internet. After Rick helped them get signed onto American/Columbia Records, SOAD began to record in his studio. In 1997 SOAD won the Best Signed Band award from the Rock City Awards. Prior to 1998, SOAD&#x27;s live shows were called &quot;The Dark Red Experience&quot;. Debut album (1998-2000) In the summer of 1998, System of a Down released their debut album, System of a Down. They enjoyed moderate success with their first single &quot;Sugar&quot; becoming a radio favorite, followed by the single &quot;Spiders&quot;. After the release of the album, System of a Down toured extensively, opening for Slayer before making their way to the second stage of Ozzfest. Following Ozzfest, they toured with Fear Factory and Incubus before headlining the Sno-Core tour with Puya, Mr. Bungle, The Cat and Incubus providing support. System was scheduled to play the 1999 Family Values Tour, but were kicked off by Fred Durst over his inability to sign the band Taproot. Fred Durst has since admitted that he was a &quot;complete wanker&quot; in relation to this &quot;oversight&quot;. The band have yet to comment on Durst&#x27;s involvement or commentary. In 2000, the group contributed their cover of the Black Sabbath song &quot;Snowblind&quot; to the Sabbath tribute album Nativity in Black 2. Toxicity, Steal This Album! (2001-2003) The group&#x27;s big break arrived when their second album Toxicity debuted at #1 on the American and Canadian charts, eventually achieving multi-platinum certification. The album has since sold 6 million copies worldwide. It was still on top in America on the week of the September 11, 2001 attacks and the political environment caused by the attacks added to the controversy surrounding their hit single &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; causing it to be taken off the radio as it contained politically sensitive lyrics at the time such as &quot;(I don&#x27;t think you) trust in my self-righteous suicide. &quot; Regardless, the video gained constant play on MTV as did the second single, &quot;Toxicity&quot;. Even with the controversy surrounding &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; which earned a Grammy nomination, System of a Down still received constant airplay in the United States throughout late 2001 and 2002 with &quot;Toxicity &quot; and &quot;Aerials&quot;. In May 2006, VH1 listed Toxicity in the #14 slot in the 40 Greatest Metal Songs. In 2001, the band went on tour with Slipknot in the United States and Mexico. After seeing the success of the tour, System and Slipknot went on a Pledge of Allegiance Tour with Rammstein in 2002. In late 2001, a few unreleased tracks made their way onto the Internet. The group released a statement that the tracks were unfinished material. Soon after, the band released the final versions of the songs, which were recorded at the same time, but hadn&#x27;t been used for Toxicity. The result was Steal This Album!, released in November 2002. Steal This Album! resembled a burnable CD that was marked with a felt-tip marker. 50,000 special copies of the album with different CD designs were also released, each designed by a different member of the band. The name of the album is a reference to Abbie Hoffman&#x27;s counter-culture book, Steal This Book and as a message to those who stole the songs and released them on the Internet. &quot;Steal This Album was the lowest rated album that we had ever made&quot; Dolmayan said in an interview. The song &quot;Innervision&quot; was released as a promo single and received constant airplay on alternative radio. A video for &quot;Boom!&quot; was filmed with director Michael Moore as a protest against the War in Iraq. Mezmerize / Hypnotize (2004-2005) From 2004 to 2005, the group produced a double album, Mezmerize/Hypnotize with the two parts released six months apart. The first album, Mezmerize, was released on May 17, 2005, to favorable reviews by critics. It debuted at #1 in the United States, Canada, Australia and all around the world, making it System of a Down&#x27;s second #1 album. First week sales rocketed to over 800,000 copies worldwide. The Grammy Award-winning single &quot;B. Y. O. B. &quot;, which questions the integrity of war, worked its way up the Billboard Modern Rock and Mainstream Rock charts. The next single, &quot;Question!&quot; was released with Shavo Odadjian co-directing the music video. Following the release of Mezmerize, the band toured extensively throughout the United States and Canada with The Mars Volta and Bad Acid Trip supporting. The second part of the double album, Hypnotize, was released on November 22, 2005. Like Mezmerize, it debuted at #1 in the US, making System of a Down, along with the Beatles, Guns &#x27;N Roses, and rappers 2Pac and DMX, the only artists to ever have two studio albums debut at #1 in the same year. In February 2006, the band won the Grammy for Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;B. Y. O. B. &quot;, beating out other established artists such as Nine Inch Nails and Robert Plant. Their second single off the Hypnotize album, &quot;Lonely Day&quot; was released in March in the United States. System of a Down released &quot;Kill Rock &#x27;N Roll&quot; and &quot;Vicinity of Obscenity&quot; as their next promo singles. The band headlined Ozzfest 2006 in cities where tour founder Ozzy Osbourne opted not to appear or wasn&#x27;t playing on the main stage. These shows turned out to be the bands last performances together to date. Hiatus and Future (2006-present) In May 2006, the band announced they were going on hiatus. Daron Malakian has confirmed the break will probably last a few years, but it was Shavo who in an interview with Guitar magazine said it will last at least 3 years, but insists that the band would not be splitting up. He told MTV, &quot;We&#x27;re not breaking up. If that was the case, we wouldn&#x27;t be doing this Ozzfest. We&#x27;re going to take a very long break after Ozzfest and do our own things. We&#x27;ve done System for over ten years, and I think it&#x27;s healthy to take a rest. &quot; During their performance in Houston, Texas, Malakian also took a moment to say, &quot;There&#x27;s been a lot of rumors about us breaking up. Well, don&#x27;t listen to them. Us four right here, we will always be System of a Down!&quot; However, Malakian announced he was forming a band called Scars on Broadway, which has since been joined by Dolmayan, and will work on its debut album during autumn. Odadjian will be working on a project with RZA of Wu-Tang Clan named Achozen as well as his UrSession website/record label. Tankian plans to keep recording as a solo artist/producer with his first single being Empty Walls off his first album Elect the Dead which was released on October 23, 2007, while Dolmayan, on top of Scars on Broadway, plans to open a comic book store online, which should be up online in November 2007. System of a Down&#x27;s final performance before their hiatus took place on August 13, 2006 in West Palm Beach, Florida, as part of the 2006 Ozzfest Festival. &quot;Tonight will be the last show we play for a long time together&quot;, Malakian told the crowd during Sunday&#x27;s last performance. &quot;We&#x27;ll be back. We just don&#x27;t know when. &quot; It was stated by Sharon Osbourne that System of a Down was paid &quot;about $325,000 a show. &quot; System of a Down&#x27;s songs were used in the 2006 film &quot;Screamers&quot; by Carla Garapedian. &quot;Screamers&quot; debuted in theaters in large city markets such as New York City, Detroit, Washington D. C. , San Francisco, Fresno, Providence, and Boston. An earlier engagement started exclusively in Los Angeles on , 2006. System of a Down was honored at the USC v. Cal game at the Los Angeles Coliseum in Los Angeles, CA in 2006. The Spirit of Troy also known as the Trojan Marching Band performed three System of a Down songs. The marching band was honored to play &quot;Toxicity&quot;, &quot;Sugar&quot;, and Hypnotize&quot; along with John Dolmayan and Shavo Odadjian. Tankian recently said that he has wanted to work on his &quot;solo record for years&quot;. As for the future of the band, he said that he does not know whether System of a Down is over or not. He also stated that &quot;maybe in a few years&quot; the band would &quot;want to make another album. It&#x27;s impossible to tell right now. It&#x27;ll be later down the line; then we&#x27;ll be able to tell what might happen. &quot; Bassist Shavo Odadjian was recently revealed to be directing the first video for the comeback of the hardcore punk band, Bad Brains. For the 2007 Grammys, System of a Down was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance for &quot;Lonely Day&quot;, but lost to Wolfmother and their song &quot;Woman&quot;. Shavo Odadjian recently told Launch Radio Networks that System of a Down is &quot;alive and well&quot;. \"We&#x27;re just not working together right now. We kind of like split up at first, but you know, we&#x27;re brothers, man, we&#x27;ll take bullets for each other. So it&#x27;s like, you kind of miss each other after a while and you, one guy makes the first move, then another starts making phone calls&#8230;. this is a juggernaut, man. System of a Down is my lifeline. It&#x27;ll never go away. We could not make a record for 10 years -- that&#x27;s not gonna happen, but I&#x27;m just saying we could -- and we&#x27;ll come back strong. \" Future and possible Reunion When asked in February 2008 if a reunion was planned any time in the future, Daron Malakian had admitted that System of a Down may never get back together again. He had this to say: \"There&#x27;s no talk of System doing anything. We&#x27;re not planning on doing anything. If anyone&#x27;s holding their breath for a System record, they&#x27;re going to turn blue and pass out. It&#x27;s a long ways away, if it ever even happens. We don&#x27;t even talk about it - none of us. This (Scars on Broadway) is my band right now. \" On September 14, 2007 an American TV interview video with Shavo Odadjian was posted online, and subsequently embedded on the MySpace profile of his current working band, Achozen. He commented on System of a Down&#x27;s status and future, saying: \"We&#x27;re taking a break. It got to a point where we we&#x27;re kinda&#8230;not implode but like, y&#x27;know, I saw something and &#8230; Thirteen years of non stop y&#x27;know, so- and we all have things we wanna do&#8230; Everyone and their mother wants to say that we are breaking up, that we broke up. It&#x27;s like, everyone talks to me &#x27;Oh you guys broke up&#x27; no we didn&#x27;t break up, why d&#x27;ya want us to brea- you want us to break up, we&#x27;ll break up!\" In a September 13, 2007 interview, frontman Serj Tankian offered his take on the band&#x27;s future by saying: &quot;It&#x27;s very simple. System of a Down, we&#x27;ve been a band for 11 years, or 12 years. We&#x27;ve put out five records, we&#x27;re all friends. We&#x27;re still friends. And we decided to take time to pursue our own artistic and personal goals. And unlike a company like Nabisco that puts out crackers every year, or cookies every year, we&#x27;re artists, we&#x27;re friends. So we don&#x27;t have to necessarily do things the same way every year. So we took time to do our own things and we left the door open. We&#x27;re all friends. If we ever want to get together and speak to the world as System of a Down, then we will. If not, then we&#x27;ll&#8230;the door is open. \" When asked if there could be a possible reunion one day, he responded by saying: &quot;It&#x27;s very possible&quot;. In an April 2008 interview with Kerrang magazine, guitarist Daron Malakian and drummer John Dolmayan (who have recently formed a side project known as Scars on Broadway) gave their takes on the bands future. When told that many people are going to wonder what the future of the band is, Malakian responded by stating that: &quot;We&#x27;ll all know when the time is right&quot;. Dolmayan added: &quot;It&#x27;ll just happen&quot;. Malakian went on to say: \"Yeah. It&#x27;ll feel good and happen. I can respect this situation (System&#x27;s hiatus) more than I can respect the situation where two people are like, &#x27;The lead singer fucked my girlfriend!&#x27; and that kind of bullshit. Nah, man. The lead singer is a special person to me and I am to him. And that&#x27;s how we ended off. Same with Shavo, same with John. And it will always be. It was a big part of my life. We were onstage together for a long time, man. We went through shit as a band and friends &ndash; we slept in RVs together!\" In an interview with Tankian about Big Day Out 2009 (a show which involved playing his Elect the Dead album live with the Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and a few songs from his then-upcoming second studio album) Tankian stated, &quot;Every few months I am honored to hear interesting rumors about whether the band is going to tour or break up permanently. I find them all to be very entertaining. &quot; On October 31, 2009, Odadjian threw a Halloween party at the Roxy during which he, Malakian, and Dolmayan performed &quot;Suite-Pee&quot; (off System of a Down), Scars on Broadway&#x27;s &quot;They Say,&quot; and an unknown song. This performance was followed by another partial reunion of the band on November 20, 2009, at the Avalon in Hollywood during which Malakian, Dolmayan, and Odadjian played &quot;Aerials&quot; and &quot;Toxicity. &quot; Reunion (2011) On Monday, November 29th, 2010, System of a Down announced on their website that they would reform for a string of large European festival dates in June 2011. Among the announced tour dates included UK&#x27;s Download Festival, Switzerland&#x27;s Greenfield Festival, Germany&#x27;s Rock am Ring/Rock im Park and Sweden&#x27;s Metaltown festivals. In their reunion statement posted on their website, the band was unclear as to the extent of their reformation. It read, &quot;We have no master plan of sorts &ndash; we are playing these shows simply because we want to play together again as a band and for you, our amazing fans. &quot; From late February to early March 2012, they headlined five dates at Soundwave festival. This was the band&#x27;s first visit to Australia since 2005. The band have continued playing around the world. On August 11 and 12, 2012, they played the Heavy MTL and Heavy T. O. music festivals in Montreal and Toronto, respectively. On February 4, 2013, it was announced that System of a Down would play the UK&#x27;s Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2013, among other festivals and venues. ", "The Strypes": "The Strypes are a 4-piece rhythm &amp; blues band from Cavan, Ireland, signed to Mercury Records. www. thestrypes. com The Strypes are 4-piece rhythm and blues band hailing from Cavan, Ireland, formed in 2011 by Ross Farrelly (lead vocals/harmonica), Josh McClorey (lead guitar/vocals), Pete O&#x27;Hanlon (bass guitar/harmonica) and Evan Walsh (drums). The group has spent the past 18 months launching their explosive R&amp;B assault on the clubs and festivals of Ireland, the UK and Europe, viciously hammering out a no-nonsense blues set influenced by the likes of Dr. Feelgood, Chuck Berry, The Yardbirds, The Rolling Stones, Little Walter and Bo Diddley. Having already been met with critical acclaim from greats such as Jeff Beck and Paul Weller, been tipped by NME as the No. 1 new band to watch, and being newly-signed to Mercury Records, it seems things can only get better for The Strypes.

", "Pavement": "Pavement are an American indie rock band that formed in Stockton, California in 1989. For most of the period to 1999, the band consisted of Stephen Malkmus (vocals, guitar), Scott &quot;Spiral Stairs&quot; Kannberg (guitar, vocals), Mark Ibold (bass), Steve West (drums) and Bob Nastanovich (percussion, vocals). During that period, and since, they have frequently been described as one of the most influential bands to emerge from the American underground of the &#x27;90s. While their split in 1999 was reportedly rather acrimonious, they undertook a well-received reunion tour during 2010. Pavement formed in Stockton, California, in 1989 as a studio project of guitarists and vocalists Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg, known originally only as &quot;S. M. &quot; and &quot;Spiral Stairs&quot;, respectively. Their debut EPs were extremely lo-fi releases titled Slay Tracks (1933-1969), Demolition Plot J-7, and Perfect Sound Forever. They were recorded at Louder Than You Think, the home studio of infamous Stockton local and former hippie Gary Young. The eccentric and aging hipster also provided drums. Upon first hearing the duo&#x27;s songs, Young was quoted as saying, &quot;this Malkmus idiot is a complete songwriting genius&quot;. Pavement&#x27;s most obvious influence during this time was English rock band The Fall, although Kannberg stated in a 1992 interview that he preferred The Replacements to The Fall. The Fall&#x27;s primary member, Mark E. Smith, would often angrily claim through the years that Pavement was a &quot;rip-off&quot; of his band and that they didn&#x27;t &quot;have an original idea in their heads&quot;. However, some of the other members of The Fall actually enjoyed Pavement. Around 1992 Pavement became a full-time band, with the addition of bassist Mark Ibold - who had been one of the band&#x27;s first fans - and extra percussionist Bob Nastanovich (a fellow museum security guard along with Malkmus and David Berman, of Silver Jews) to help Young keep time. Their debut album, Slanted and Enchanted, was released commercially in 1992 after being circulated among critics and tastemakers for nearly a year, and became an instant indie classic. Though the percussive influence of The Fall was still pervasive (as was that of English post punks, Swell Maps), many of the songs also exhibited a strong sense of melody. The following year, the band released the EP, Watery, Domestic, which represented a balance between their earlier and later styles. Gary Young&#x27;s departure and Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain The tour for Slanted &amp; Enchanted gave Gary Young a chance to showcase his bizarre live behavior. He would act out by giving away cabbage and mashed potatoes to fans at the door of the venue, doing handstands, running around the venue and stage while the rest of the band was playing and drunkenly falling off his drum stool. His bizarre drug- and alcohol-fueled personality had grated on the rest of the band through several years of touring and recording and they could no longer take it. At the end of the tour, Young left Pavement. The final straw came when Young allegedly pulled a gun on Malkmus. (Malkmus later stated that this was not true: while Young had bought a gun, he never pulled it on Malkmus). The group soon after had a meeting in a hotel room in Copenhagen during which Malkmus, Kannberg and Ibold remained silent while Nastanovich (Young&#x27;s best friend at the time) argued with the drummer and informed him that his antics were unnecessary. According to the band, Gary Young quit and was replaced by Steve West. With an improved recording quality and more original songwriting, they released Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain in 1994. The record was far more indebted to the classic rock tradition than their more obscure debut. The single, &quot;Cut Your Hair&quot; was the band&#x27;s closest brush with the mainstream, and briefly enjoyed airplay on alternative rock radio and MTV. Another single, &quot;Range Life&quot;, was infamous chiefly for lyrics that criticized alt-rock superstars The Smashing Pumpkins and Stone Temple Pilots. Malkmus has insisted over the years that the line is meant to be light-hearted and timely, sung from the point of view of the aging hippie character in the song - later live versions of the track had the singer substituting Spice Girls, The Counting Crows, or countless others for &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;. Billy Corgan, leader of The Smashing Pumpkins, threatened to drop his band from the 1994 Lollapalooza Festival if Pavement was allowed to play. The Smashing Pumpkins were headlining Lollapalooza that year. Corgan and Malkmus would trade barbs through the press for several years after. Wowee Zowee and Brighten the Corners Pavement&#x27;s next album was the eclectic, inscrutable Wowee Zowee (1995). In eighteen tracks, the band covered a wide range of styles including punk, country and balladry, and largely dispensed with conventional song structures. The album was not widely admired at the time of release but is now generally embraced by fans. On the Slow Century DVD, Malkmus attributed his odd choice of singles to his pot smoking, stating that &quot;I was smoking a lot of grass back then but to me they sounded like hits. &quot; Although Malkmus has said in recent interviews that the album is the last &quot;classic Pavement record&quot;, Kannberg has voiced regrets about Wowee Zowee. &quot;We made some mistakes on that record&#8230; we were kind of pressured into putting out a record a little faster than we were ready to. I mean, I&#x27;m totally into the record. It&#x27;s just if we had another six months to think about it, it would&#x27;ve been much different. &quot; During the tour for the album, Nastonovich stated on the Slow Century DVD, the band would often not work out a setlist before shows, opting for drug and alcohol fueled jams over hit singles. Wowee Zowee was followed up by the EP, Pacific Trim, which was recorded with only Malkmus and drummers Nastanovich and Steve West. Their studio time was originally reserved for a Silver Jews recording, but frontman David Berman walked out in frustration and the trio decided not to waste prepaid recording time. 1997&#x27;s Brighten the Corners, a shorter, mellower and more focused record than the previous album, was produced by Mitch Easter. In style it resembled Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain and contained two of the band&#x27;s best known singles in &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Shady Lane&quot;. It was the only Pavement album to include a lyric sheet. The album sold better than its predecessors, but Pavement remained a cult band. It was at about this time that the band started to fragment, with its members focusing more on other musical projects or on raising families. Terror Twilight and breakup In 1999, the band released its final album, Terror Twilight. Bob Nastanovich came up with the title, and has revealed the meaning of it in several interviews: &quot;Twilight Terror is the short span between sunset and dusk; this is considered the most dangerous time in traffic, because half of the people switch on the headlights, and the other half doesn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s when most accidents happen. &quot; During an interview on the Slow Century documentary DVD, he said that the band was having trouble coming up with names for the record until he put forth Terror Twilight. One of the final contenders was Farewell Horizontal (also the name of a 1989 science fiction novel by K. W. Jeter), and Nastanovich said, &quot;There was no way I was going to be on the Farewell Horizontal tour for the next year. &quot; Malkmus wrote the entirety of the record, and the recording of the music only featured minor contributions from the rest of the band. The music on the record is by far the gentlest and most emotionally direct in the band&#x27;s discography, though the oddball Captain Beefheart homage &quot;Platform Blues&quot; is a nod to their more obscure roots. Its comparatively pristine production was helmed by Nigel Godrich, best known for his work with Radiohead and Beck. The group released one last EP, titled Major Leagues. It features three Malkmus songs, two original Spiral Stairs songs and two covers: &quot;The Killing Moon&quot; by Echo and the Bunnymen and &quot;The Classical&quot; by The Fall. Stephen Malkmus sings on both of the cover songs. After completing a world tour in London in 1999, the band announced that they were going on hiatus, which eventually revealed itself as an unofficial break-up. Nastanovich later said that it was a somewhat civil dissolution. &quot;There was too much exhaustion for heavy emotion. &quot; Slow Century and Perfect Sound Forever In 2002, Slow Century , a documentary by Lance Bangs coupled with all of the band&#x27;s music videos, was released as a 2 DVD set. Included was extensive footage, both professionally shot and taped by fans on camcorders, from the band&#x27;s earliest shows in 1989 forward. The three final songs from the band&#x27;s last show ever (&quot;Stop Breathin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Conduit for Sale&quot; and &quot;Here&quot;) are presented at the end of the documentary. Also on the DVD is a hidden easter egg clip from the same show, wherein Malkmus apparently jokingly talks about how the handcuffs attached to his microphone stand &quot;represent what it&#x27;s like being in a band all these years. &quot; A bonus disc with a complete concert in Seattle, Washington, from the early part of the Terror Twilight tour was included on the second disc, as well as several songs from their second to last show. 2004 saw the publication of &quot;Perfect Sound Forever: The Story of Pavement&quot;, a biography on the band written by Rob Jovanovic. Most reviews of the book rated it poorly, saying that it contained much of the same information as the Slow Century DVD and expanded very little on it. Post-Pavement projects * Stephen Malkmus has gone on to enjoy success as a solo artist combining his intricate guitar playing with a progressive rock influence. He has released four albums, Stephen Malkmus (2001), Pig Lib (2003), Face the Truth (2005), and Real Emotional Trash (2008) each garnering mainly warm reviews from critics and fans alike. Malkmus&#x27; new group has been known to treat audiences to Pavement songs every once in a while (On May 24, 2003, while touring in Milwaukee, Wisconsin with his new band The Jicks, Malkmus opened the show by saying, &quot;This is off our first record&quot;. The band then proceeded to play an evening&#x27;s worth of Pavement songs. This show has been dubbed by fans as The Milwaukee Show). He is a revolving member of the group Silver Jews, led by David Berman. * Scott Kannberg went on to form a musical group named Preston School of Industry, not to be confused with the Ione, California reform school nor the Pavement tune of the same name. They have released two albums with Matador Records, All this Sounds Gas (2001), and Monsoon (2004). The latter album boasts studio contributions from members of The Minus 5 and Wilco. Preston School of Industry has remained apparently inactive since the end of their September 2004 Australian tour. *Mark Ibold has been reported to be working behind the bar at a restaurant called Great Jones Cafe in New York, New York. In early 2005, rumors began to spread on the internet that he had a new group called Cam&#x27;Ron&#x27;s Foreskin. In the summer of 2006, Ibold joined Sonic Youth as their touring bass player for their Rather Ripped tour. He became a full time member of Sonic Youth and contributed to/co-wrote (as Sonic Youth albums are group efforts) on the new album The Eternal. * Steve West lives in Lexington, Virginia. He has two children and works as a stonemason. He has released 3 albums as Marble Valley. * Bob Nastanovich has a home in Louisville, Kentucky and produces a website called &quot;Lonely on the Rail&quot; which combines his passions for horse racing and writing. He tour managed for The Jicks during their first tour. Since then, Nastanovich has been a jockey agent for Greta Kuntzweiler. When asked if he was in contact with his former band members, he said, &quot;West - yes, Malkmus - yes, Ibold - rarely, Kannberg - never&quot;. He accompanied Malkmus on drums for two songs during a solo acoustic set at the 2007 Pitchfork Music Festival. * Gary Young has continued recording bands at his Stockton studio. He also has a new group, Gary Young&#x27;s Hospital, with which he records and plays concerts. Young also invented the Universal Microphone Shock Mount, &quot;an innovative approach to keeping your microphones isolated from stand vibrations. &quot; Reunion There is frequent speculation about the possibility of a Pavement reunion. In a 2006 Pitchfork interview, Scott Kannberg discussed the possibility of a reunion for the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2009. In a 2008 Entertainment Weekly article, Kannberg echoed the possibility of a 2009 reunion, and mentioned Matador Records&#x27; 20th anniversary. Mark Ibold was amiable to the idea; Malkmus, however, stated: &quot;something small in 10 years like the Zeppelin thing sounds good to me. &quot; On September 16, 2009 it was confirmed that Pavement will reunite for a show at Central Park&#x27;s SummerStage on September 21, 2010. Official statements by the band, label, venue and promoter were released on September 17, 2009 confirming the reunion. The announcement included one concert in Central Park and the promise of a tour, but said that the reunion may only be a one-off event. It said, &quot;Please be advised this tour is not a prelude to additional jaunts and/or a permanent reunion. The band held rehearsal at Audio Cinema in Portland, Oregon. The band performed several shows throughout 2010. ", "The Who": "The Who are an English Rock Band formed in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, West London, United Kingdom, in 1964. They grew to be considered one of the greatest, most influential, and awarded recording groups in the world. They are also famed for their prowess as a Live Band&ndash;being described as &quot;possibly the greatest live band ever&quot;&ndash;due to their energetic, tight, loud performances and smashing of instruments. The primary lineup was: Pete Townshend (Lead Guitar, Vocals), Roger Daltrey (Lead Vocals, Harmonica, Percussion), John Entwistle (Bass, Vocals, French Horn) and Keith Moon (Drums, Occasional Vocals). The Who rose to fame in the United Kingdom with a pioneering instrument destruction stage show, as well as a series of top ten Hit Singles (including the celebrated &quot;My Generation&quot;) and Top Five Albums, beginning in 1965 with their first Single Release &quot;I Can&#x27;t Explain&quot;. They First Hit the Top Ten in the USA in 1967 with &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot;. The 1969 release of Tommy was the first in a series of Top Five Albums for the group in the USA, followed by Live at Leeds (1970), Who&#x27;s Next (1971), Quadrophenia (1973), and Who Are You (1978). Live at Leeds is commonly cited as one of the albums that brought Hard Rock into the mainstream during the early 1970s. A mere three weeks after the release of Who Are You , Keith Moon passed away from an overdose on 7 September 1978. Kenney Jones of Small Faces/Faces took over on drums after Moon&#x27;s death. The band would release two more studio albums: the top five Face Dances (1981) and the top ten It&#x27;s Hard (1982), before officially disbanding in 1983. They reformed on several occasions to perform at special events such as Live Aid and for reunion tours such as their 25th anniversary tour in 1989, and the Quadrophenia revival tours of 1996 and 1997. In 2000, the three surviving original members began to discuss the possibility of recording an album of new material. These plans were delayed following the death of John Entwistle in 2002 from a cocaine-induced heart attack. However, subsequent to this, Pino Palladino became their touring bass player. Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey continue to perform and record as The Who; their latest studio album, Endless Wire (2006), reached the top ten in the USA and UK. Glastonbury Festival (2015) On May 6th, 2015, the band announced that they would be Glastonbury Festival&#x27;s final headliner, closing the event on Sunday, June 28th 2015. Roger Daltery said they would close the event &quot; with a bang &quot;. ", "All Time Low": "All Time Low is an American pop punk band formed in Baltimore, Maryland, United States in 2003 when Alex Gaskarth (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, keyboards) was in middle school, he was taken out of private school to public school, where he met Jack Barakat (lead guitar, backing vocals), his best friend, and put the band together and later recruited Rian Dawson (drums, percussion), and Zack Merrick (bass guitar, backing vocals). The band&#x27;s name came from a line in the song Head On Collision by the band New Found Glory. Early on All Time Low mostly performed covers of songs by bands like Green Day, blink-182, and New Found Glory. Since their debut, they have released 6 studio albums: The Party Scene (2005), So Wrong, It&#x27;s Right (2007), Nothing Personal (2009), Dirty Work (2011), Don&#x27;t Panic (2012), and Future Hearts (2015) as well as their first live album, Straight to DVD (2010). They have also released couple EPs, most notably, Put Up or Shut Up (2006), and MTV Unplugged (2010). As of April 2015, they have sold more than 1. 2 million albums worldwide, received 4 Top 10 albums, and one Platinum single, one Gold single in the US. ", "Keane": "Keane is an English rock band, first established in Battle, East Sussex, United Kingdom in 1995, taking their current name in 1997. The group is comprised of composer, bassist, and pianist Tim Rice-Oxley, lead vocalist Tom Chaplin and drummer Richard Hughes. Their original line-up included founder and guitarist Dominic Scott, who left in 2001. For their 2008 album &quot;Perfect Symmetry&quot; and the following tour, Jesse Quin joined the band on stage to play bass. He also played a large role in recording the album itself, and he subsequently joined the band fully in 2011. Keane are known for using a piano as their lead instrument instead of guitars, significantly differentiating them from most rock bands. The inclusion of a distorted piano effect since 2006 and various synthesizers are now a common feature in their music that nowadays combines the pure piano rock sound used during their first album and the alternative rock sound which developed during 2005. Acoustic and power ballads are also a highlight in the group&#x27;s music and have evolved into many fan favourite songs such as &quot;On a Day Like Today&quot; and &quot;We Might As Well Be Strangers&quot;. Keane&#x27;s first two studio albums, Hopes and Fears and Under the Iron Sea, achieved great success in the United Kingdom upon release and very high sales worldwide: their multi-award-winning debut was the best-selling British album of 2004 and their follow-up sold 222,297 copies during its first week on sale in June 2006. Their third album, Perfect Symmetry was released on 13th October 2008. First single &#x27;Spiralling&#x27; was available for free download, and half a million copies were downloaded worldwide. The album has clear 80s influences, and is compared in Q magazine to both David Bowie&#x27;s &#x27;Scary Monsters&#x27; and The Dandy Warhols&#x27; &#x27;Welcome To The Monkey House&#x27;. The band have cited Talking Heads as another key influence. This was their first album to include guitar, successfully breaking away from their original set-up. The Silenced By The Night Songfacts reports that their fourth album, Strangeland will be released from 4 May 2012 through Island Records. First single &#x27;Silenced By The Night&#x27; was originally only to be released as a commercial single in the United States, but was released worldwide apart from the United Kingdom on March 13, 2012. The single was finally dropped in Keane&#x27;s home country April 15, 2012. ", "Electric Six": "There are two artists that have used the name Electric Six 1. An alternative rock band from the United States 2. A musical group from South Africa 1. Electric Six is a six-piece Detroit-based rock band consisting of Dick Valentine (vocals), Tait Nucleus? (synthesizers), Johhny Na$hinal (guitar), Da Ve (guitar), Percussion World (drums), and Smorgasboard (bass) who play a mix of rock, funk and disco. The band&#x27;s first notorious formation comprised Valentine, Rock and Roll Indian (guitar), Surge Joebot (guitar), Disco (bass, former member of Detroit Cobras), and M (drums). Dick Valentine (real name Tyler Spencer) has always been the primary songwriter (both music and lyrics) of Electric Six, currently and under their former incarnation, when they were known as the Wildbunch. During the band&#x27;s temporary split at the end of the 1990s, Spencer formed his own band called The Dirty Shame and released one CD entitled Smog Cutter Love Story which featured, among other tracks, a first version of Fire track &quot;Vengeance and Fashion&quot;. The band reformed by 2001 to record and release the first release of &#x27;Danger! High Voltage&#x27; and record the track &#x27;Dealin&#x27; With Death N&#x27; Stealin&#x27; In The Name Of The Lord&#x27; with Troy Gregory for his Sybil album. Electric Six fuses rock and punk with the laid-back funky rhythms and falsetto vocals of disco, and a distinctly comic touch. However, they tend to reject such genre classifications as disco-metal and disco punk. They formed the band in 1996 and were initially known as The Wildbunch, eventually dropping that name due to pressure from the Bristol trip-hop collection of the same name. Throughout the latter half of the &#x27;90s, they played about once a month at the Magic Bag in Ferndale, Magic Stick, and the now-defunct Gold Dollar in Detroit, the center of a scene that produced breakout acts like the White Stripes. Electric Six&#x27;s 2002 breakout single &quot;Danger! High Voltage&quot; was an infectious dance-rock number, and Jack White from The White Stripes helped sing back up vocals to this track. White has denied this, though Spencer has confirmed it in several interviews. The single reached number 2 on the UK singles chart, and they enjoy icon status in that nation. Their second single, &quot;Gay Bar&quot;, released in 2003, became a hit as well in the UK, reaching #5 in the charts and further aided the group&#x27;s growth. Curiously, in the American Radio Edit of this track, The words &quot;Nuclear War&quot; are censored with whip-crack sound effects. After fulfilling their recording duties (namely their debut album) three members left in June, leaving Dick Valentine, Tait Nucleus? (synthesizer), and M. The Colonel (Zach Shipps, guitar, ex-member of Brendan Benson and Mood Elevator), John R Dequindre (guitar and whose stage name is a combination of two Detroit streets) and Frank Lloyd Bonaventure (bass) subsequently joined the group, though they had all been credited on the album and most had been associated with the group for some time. At that time, they were touring in the UK, and they managed to seamlessly replace the members without interrupting the gigs. In time, Johnny Na$hinal joined the group on guitar, Dequindre switched to bass, and Bonaventure switched to law school. The band&#x27;s sophomore album, Senor Smoke, was released in the UK on February 14, 2005. Percussion World replaced M on drums around the same time. The first single from the album put the band at the center of controversy, especially with Queen fans following a cover of the Queen hit song &quot;Radio Ga Ga&quot;. The controversial music video shows lead singer Dick Valentine as the ghost of Queen&#x27;s flamboyant lead singer Freddie Mercury and a backing band of poodles. Queen drummer Roger Taylor, who wrote the song, said that he was &quot;unimpressed&quot; with the video; however, Queen guitarist Brian May reportedly liked it. Electric Six claims they were contractually obligated to commit the song to the album. Issues with Warner Brothers caused a switch to Metropolis Records, who released Senor Smoke in the US. Switzerland was released in September 2006. A plethora of videos have also been released, and a fan contribution contest led to the video for the single &quot;I Buy the Drugs. &quot; I Shall Exterminate Everything Around Me That Restricts Me From Being the Master was released in October 2007. Their next album, titled Flashy, was released in October 2008. In October 2009, their sixth album, KILL, was released. The 7th album, Zodiac was released on September 28, 2010, with one tour-exclusive single (&quot;Jam it in the Hole&quot;) and the 8th, Heartbeats and Brainwaves, on October 11th 2011. A double live album is set for release in 2012. 2. Electric Six was a Soweto-based South African combo active in the 1960s and 1970s", "The Radio Dept.": "The Radio Dept. is a Swedish pop band signed to Labrador Records . They have released three full length albums, and a series of singles and EPs. The band originated in Lund, Sweden. In 1995, The Radio Dept. was formed by Elin Almered and Johan Duncanson (who were old school friends). The name was taken from a gas station/radio repair shop in Lund, Sweden, which had a large sign with the name Radioavdelningen , (&quot;The Radio Department&quot; in Swedish) hanging outside their shop. Since 1995 members have been coming and going and at some points there has never really been a Radio Department at all. Martin Carlberg and Johan Duncanson started playing together in 1998 and decided to use the name The Radio Dept. Since then the band has done lots of gigs and lots of recordings. The Radio Dept. recorded 4-tracks in friends&#x27; living rooms or at home, in smelly warehouse, in demo studios with blinking fluorescent lightning and at schools. In the autumn of 2001 Lisa Carlberg and Per Blomgren (Bass &amp; drums respectively), joined the band and they started rehearsing in the way bands so often do. Soon afterwards they were all joined by Daniel Tjader on the keyboards. Their recordings were sent to the music magazine Sonic and got a nice review. They were also on the free CD sampler that comes with the magazine. That&#x27;s where Labrador Records discovered and learned to love the band. Now they&#x27;re a part of Swedish indie label, Comings and goings Original band member, Elin Almered, left the band before the recording of The Radio Dept. &#x27;s debut (lesser matters), but still made an appearance singing vocals for &quot;Strange Things Will Happen&quot;. Per Blomgren, Drummer, left the band before the release of Lesser Matters. The band opted instead for digital assistance with regards to drums &amp; percussions for their songs. Lisa Carlberg, bassist, departed from the Radio Dept soon after the release of &quot;This past week EP&quot;. The band no longer felt the need for a member that solely specialized in bass. The band was taking a new direction and preparing for their second album, &quot;Pet Grief&quot;, which wouldn&#x27;t require a member that played bass guitar. The current line up of the band is: Johan Duncanson (Guitar &amp; Vocals), Martin Carlberg(Guitar) and Daniel Tjader (Keyboards &amp; Synth) (2006). More details can be found on the radio dept. website: theradiodept. com . Record Labels. Slottet: Created in 2001, this is the Radio Dept&#x27;s original label. Created &amp; managed by the band themselves. They published and distributed their own recordings in order to spread their music to the world. The &quot;Against The Tide EP&quot; &amp; coveted &quot;Annie Laurie EP&quot; were both released on this label in 2002. At sporadic moments over the years, whenever the band have wanted to release something quickly or for free, they&#x27;d do so through the Slottet label (e. g. bachelor Kisses in 2008). Labrador : After the success of the self released records and some glittering reviews in local publications, several major labels came calling. The Radio Dept. rejected most of these offers and instead signed with Labrador records. Although the band don&#x27;t consider themselves connected ideologically or musically with Labrador and the other bands on the label, they have much respect for the label which has officially become the home of The Radio Dept. Shelflife records: Shelflife are an american indie label that operate on a similar philosophy to that of Sarah Records. They select highly innovative, creative &amp; melodic bands and offer them transatlantic distribution. Several labrador bands had achieved success through shelflife, so it seemed an obvious choice to use them again for the distribution of &#x27;Lesser Matters&#x27;. No futher Radio Dept records were released through shelflife. Rex records: Rex records was an London based experimental indie label started by an ex-XL employee. The aim was to release demos and promote leftfield indie music. Only two Radio Dept. records were released on Rex, Why Won&#x27;t You Talk About It and the rare Liebling 7&quot;. XL Recordings: During 2004/05, XL funded, distributed and promoted The Radio Dept. During this short partnership 4 records were released. Lesser Matters, Where Damage Isn&#x27;t Already Done, Why Won&#x27;t You Talk About It? and Ewan. A short european tour was organised for the band as well as lots of press and an appearance on an XL compilation with the likes of Ratatat &amp; MIA. Track &amp; Field Records: Track &amp; Field are another London based record label that took a chance on The Radio Dept. In 2006 Track &amp; Field were employed to distribute Pet Grief in the UK. They also promoted the band and planned for an extensive UK tour. This plan was abandoned and a series of special one-off London shows were organised to supplant the tour. Pony Canyon: After years as an experienced distributor of DVD&#x27;s &amp; kids toys, Pony Canyon, tried their hand at promoting &amp; distributing indie records. So far they&#x27;ve only distributed a special edition of Pet Grief in Japan. Soundtrack Three tracks by the Radio Dept. have been featured on the Sophia Coppola&#x27;s film Marie Antoinette (2006) . They are: Pulling our Weight, Keen on Boys, I Don&#x27;t Like It Like This. ", "Mac DeMarco": "Mac DeMarco, formerly Makeout Videotape, is the antithesis to your stereotypical singer-songwriter. Disregarding the seriously somber moments, he replaces them with whimsical and youthful spontaneity, whilst retaining endearing and subtle commentaries. Promptly after leaving his Edmonton garage for Vancouver he embarked on a grand voyage of enlightenment and alcoholic debauchery. DeMarco's a weird cat, cultivating an affinity for occult imagery, nudity and social satire. But his most impressive trait is his undeniable and instinctual ability to compose magical pop jangles, which he refers to as \"jizz jazz. \" His dusted jams have garnished him accolades that are as ever-increasing as his song-writing abilities. ", "A$AP Rocky": "Rakim Mayers (born October 3, 1987 in Harlem, New York NY, United States), better known by his stage name ASAP Rocky (stylized as A$AP Rocky), is an American rapper and director. ASAP Rocky gained recognition among the hip hop community in 2011. His first longplay &#x27; Long. Live. A$AP &#x27; was released on January, 15th 2013.

Quentin Leo Cook was educated at Reigate Grammar School. He started a punk fanzine titled Peroxide with his neighbour Andrew Thomas and art student Ian McKay (formerly Laidlaw). Contemporary with his publishing activities, he played drums in Disque Attack (a British new-wave-influenced rock band) for which he later performed lead vocals. At Reigate College he also met Paul Heaton and, at 18, he went to the Brighton Polytechnic to study a BA in English, Politics and Sociology. Although he had begun DJing some years before, it was at this time that he began to develop his skills on the thriving Brighton club scene. In 1985 Cook&#x27;s friend Paul Heaton who lived in Hull had formed a guitar band called The Housemartins. The Housemartins&#x27; bassist had just quit on the eve of their first national tour. Cook had lost interest in the rock scene and could barely play a musical instrument, he agreed to move to Hull to join them. The band soon had a hit single with &quot;Happy Hour&quot;. They also reached number one just before Christmas 1986 with a version of &quot;Caravan of Love&quot; originally a hit the year before for Isley Jasper Isley. However, by 1988 they had split up. Heaton and the band&#x27;s drummer Dave Hemingway went on to form The Beautiful South, while Cook moved back to Brighton to pursue his interest in the style of music he preferred. It was at this time that he first started working with young studio engineer Simon Thornton, with whom he continues to make records. All Cook&#x27;s records released from that point onwards have involved both of them to varying degrees (Thornton is credited in 2004 as &quot;Executive Producer&quot; for example). Cook formed Beats International, a loose confederation of studio musicians including vocalists Lindy Layton, Lester Noel, D. J. Baptiste, rapper MC Wildski, and keyboardist Andy Boucher. Their first album, Let Them Eat Bingo, included the number one single, &quot;Dub Be Good to Me&quot;. &quot;Dub Be Good To Me&quot; caused a legal dispute revolving around allegations of infringement of copyright through the liberal use of unauthorised samples: the bassline was a note-for-note lift from The Clash&#x27;s &quot;The Guns Of Brixton&quot; and the song also borrowed heavily from the S. O. S. Band&#x27;s &quot;Just Be Good to Me&quot;. The 1991 follow-up album Excursion on the Version, an exploration of dub and reggae rhythms, failed to repeat the success of its predecessor. Cook then formed Freakpower, with horn player and singer Ashley Slater. The duo released their debut album, Drive Thru Booty, in 1994, which contained the single &quot;Turn On Tune In Cop Out&quot;. The cut was picked up by the Levi&#x27;s company for use in a multimillion-dollar advertisement campaign. Freakpower has also done several other releases under the name Fried Funk Food. In 1995, Cook enlisted help from producer friends Tim Jeffery and JC Reid to create a solo house music album under the &#x27;Pizzaman&#x27; pseudonym. The Pizzamania album spawned 3 UK Top 40 hits in &quot;Trippin&#x27; on Sunshine&quot;, &quot;Sex on the Streets&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot;. &quot;Happiness&quot; was picked up by the Del Monte Foods corporation for use in a UK fruit juice ad. Cook is also behind a group The Mighty Dub Katz along with Gareth Hansome (aka GMoney), Cook&#x27;s former flatmate and the inventor of the name &quot;Big Beat&quot;. Together they started the Boutique Nightclub in Brighton, formerly known as the Big Beat Boutique, evidently imitating the Heavenly Social in London. In 1996, Cook then re-joined Ashley Slater for the second Freakpower album, titled More of Everything for Everybody. The Fatboy Slim album Better Living Through Chemistry (released through Skint Records) marked Cook&#x27;s emergence into the big time. Filled with retro samples and funk-laden grooves, the album was among the first in the then-new big beat sound. It also spawned one Top 40 UK hit, &quot;Everybody Needs a 303&quot;. After Cook&#x27;s remix of Cornershop&#x27;s &quot;Brimful of Asha&quot; topped the charts, such musical heavy hitters as Madonna and U2 asked him to produce for them. Fatboy Slim&#x27;s next work was the single &quot;The Rockafeller Skank,&quot; released prior to the album You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby, both of which were released in 1998 to rave reviews. This album also produced the single &quot;Praise You&quot;, which also became a major dance hit, giving Cook his first UK solo number one. Its video, directed by Spike Jonze, won numerous awards. Further Fatboy Slim works have appeared in movies, television series, and more ads and started a trend where Norman Cook appeared in each video in some shape or form. In 1999, he was on tour, stopping in San Francisco and New York&#x27;s Hammerstein Ballroom. It should be noted that the single Rockafeller Skank was based entirely around a Lord Finesse vocal sample; &quot;Right about now, the funk soul brother. Check it out now, the funk soul brother&quot;. Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars was released in 2000 and featured two collaborations with Macy Gray. It also included &quot;Sunset (Bird of Prey)&quot;, a slower tempo piece based around a sample of Jim Morrison from The Doors, and &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;, which also boasted an award-winning video starring Christopher Walken. On 13 July 2002 Fatboy Slim performed the second of his free, open air concerts on Brighton beach. Despite expecting a crowd of around 60,000 people the event instead attracted an estimated 250,000 who crammed the promenade and beach between Brighton&#x27;s famous piers. Local police forced the event to end early amid safety concerns, overcrowding, and one death. After the music had finished and the crowd began to dissipate, traffic ensued throughout the Brighton area with many caught in traffic jams until the morning. Cook was awarded a star on the city of Brighton&#x27;s Walk of Fame, next to that of Winston Churchill. He married TV personality Zoe Ball in 1999; the couple have one son named Woody. Cook is also a 12% shareholder of the football club he has supported since moving to Brighton in the late 1980s, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. Fatboy has often played to welcoming crowds in the superclubs of Ibiza, where he also met his wife. 2002 saw him make appearances at Space and Privilege. At Space there was a minor altercation when Cook inadvertently faded down the house PA while playing on the Terrace during the marathon &#x27;We Love Sundays&#x27; closing party. With only the booth monitors barely audible the crowd began to shuffle indifferently, in stark contrast to Cook who was having a great time behind the decks. This continued for several minutes until &#x27;We Love&#x27; promoter Darren Hughes ran into the booth, grabbed the appropriate control on the mixer and slammed the volume back to full blast. This resulted in a humorous acknowledgement from Cook and euphoria amongst the assembled revellers. Cook went on to complete a memorable set, including a classic Space Terrace moment with John Paul Young&#x27;s vintage singalong track &quot;Love is in the Air&quot;. The following day Cook appeared in the main room at Privilege, officially the world&#x27;s biggest club, for Manumission. His set began well but a thunderstorm was raging outside and after a few records the house PA failed, and once again Cook was playing to a huge crowd with only the weak output of the booth monitors. Attempting to make the best of the situation, Cook angled the monitors towards the crowd and continued with his set, at least entertaining those clubbers fortunate enough to be near the booth. In the cavernous space of Privilege this proved futile and after a short while Cook abandoned any attempt to DJ, removed his shoe, placed this on the turntable, then finally admitted defeat and departed the booth with a shrug of the shoulders and a wave to the disappointed crowd. Later the same year Q magazine named Fatboy Slim in their 50 Bands To See Before You Die list. In January 2003, Cook and his wife underwent a very public break-up, but three months later, they were reconciled. In 2004, Cook released two remixes in June and July, based on Max Sedgley&#x27;s &quot;Happy&quot; and &quot;Follow Me Follow Me (Quem Que Caguetou)&quot; by Black Alien &amp; Speed. The latter, a Hip Hop hit from Brazil, became popular in Europe after having appeared on the Nissan X-Trail advert (portraying a more extreme type of marathon). Fatboy Slim&#x27;s remix was then used in the advert itself. His first album in four years, Palookaville, was less successful than previous releases. In the UK, BBC Radio 1 received an exclusive play of the first single &quot;Slash Dot Dash&quot;, while in the U. S. &quot;The Joker&quot; (a collaboration with Bootsy Collins) had been exclusively aired. The song was appearing on the radio and was made quickly available on iTunes months ahead of the album release. Palookaville represented a significant shift in style for Cook, from loop and sample based compositions to more conventional song structures and many original recordings of real instruments (Cook himself plays bass on some of the album&#x27;s tracks, with Simon Thornton playing various other instruments along with guest artists, e. g. Justin Robertson). This change in style also led to the use of new production techniques and studio technology. Until Palookaville Cook had been using an Atari ST computer for sequencing and composition, a classic production tool favoured by many dance music producers for its stability, simplicity and rock solid timing. For the new album he made use of a Pro Tools rig, a powerful digital audio workstation environment found in most modern recording studios. This perhaps reluctant move by Cook was ultimately necessary to deliver the polished production style evident in the recordings. The resulting body of work features &quot;traditional&quot; Fatboy Slim tracks such as &quot;Jin Go Lo Ba&quot; alongside full length vocal tracks including a suitably updated rendition of the Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&quot;. (The music video for the latter consists entirely of kittens in the lead roles). The album also features many more vocal collaborations including tracks with rapper Lateef, Brighton-based band Johnny Quality and Damon Albarn (Blur, Gorillaz). In 2005, his 2004 hit single &quot;Wonderful Night&quot; was placed on Konami&#x27;s Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 for PlayStation 2. In June 2005 he filled the Friday night headline slot on the &#x27;Other Stage&#x27; at the Glastonbury Festival, a booking which actually generated a financial loss for Cook when he decided to stage a spectacular visual show involving banks of display screens at the rear of the stage (with his DJ booth set in the middle) and a sophisticated 3D light show with special glasses supplied to members of the audience. In a televised post-gig interview Cook revealed how the cost of staging the show had outstripped the famously low appearance fees received by Glastonbury performers. In October of the same year Fatboy Slim and Talking Heads singer David Byrne revealed their plans for a musical about Imelda Marcos, the controversial ex-First Lady of the Philippines. It premiered at Australia&#x27;s Adelaide Festival of Arts in March 2006. On the New Years Eve 2005, Fatboy Slim performed live on Bondi Beach in Australia. During this all night set, Fatboy Slim reverted to his original style of music production and DJing with an emphasis on Dance music. Why Try Harder is Fatboy Slim&#x27;s greatest hits album and was released on 19 June 2006. It comprises eighteen tracks, including ten Top 40 singles, a couple of Number Ones and two exclusive new tracks - &quot;Champion Sound&quot; and &quot;That Old Pair of Jeans&quot;. The title comes from the famous UK album cover for You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way Baby, which featured a large man with a T-shirt bearing the legend &quot;I&#x27;M #1 SO WHY TRY HARDER&quot;. Cook has repeatedly stated in 2006 interviews that the phrase &quot;why try harder&quot; is a statement, not a question. On 24 June 2006, Fatboy Slim headlined The &quot;Rock Ness Festival&quot; at Loch Ness, Scotland. The following month he also filled the Saturday headline slot at the Global Gathering festival, Long Marston Airfield in the English Midlands. He played a two hour set containing most of his classics and also some of his new material. This is widely regarded as one of the highlights of the festival, perhaps just losing out to Daft Punk&#x27;s once in a lifetime performance the previous evening. Once again Fatboy appeared in front of an impressive visual stage set comprising video screens and 3D lighting. A spectacular firework display rounded off the show. After being banned by police from playing in Brighton since 2002 after the deaths of two people at his 2002 gig, Fatboy Slim was given permission in 2006 to play again in his home town. It should be noted that the first death was a heart attack brought on by natural causes and the second death was caused by a fall from a wall some time after the gig had finished. The police attributed no blame to Fatboy Slim or the promoter for the deaths. However the promoter had massively underestimated the numbers that would attend, mainly due to the show being unofficially advertised on a London radio station. As a result the entire towns roads and pavements became grid locked and the emergency services were heavily affected. On 1 January 2007 he played to an audience of over 20,000 fans along Brighton&#x27;s seafront (along Madeira Drive along the beach east of Brighton Pier). Tickets to the event were made available only to Brighton residents, although inevitably some were sold to others on eBay. He recently performed in Brazil, in its version of the Big Brother reality show. Fatboy Slim&#x27;s Big Beach Boutique 3 was deemed a stunning success by Sussex Police, Fatboy Slim, and the crowd. The gathering was named &quot;best party city&quot; by DJ David Guetta, although this was just after both his CD mixers broke down. &quot;Luckily&quot; he said &quot;Fatboy plays vinyl&quot; and so the crowd returned. The Cuban Brothers and David Guetta opened the show. Cook performed mixes of Gorillaz and Fedde Le Grand&#x27;s &quot;Put Your Hands Up For (Brighton)&quot;. Summer 2007 saw Fatboy take a well earned break from the DJ circuit, although he did still return for appearances at Glastonbury and in Ibiza. Glastonbury saw him headlining the East Dance Tent on Friday night and also playing an intimate Saturday night secret gig in the Lost Vagueness ballroom, sharing the bill with ska legends Madness. Befitting of a Lost Vagueness party, Cook accompanied his DJ set with a protracted costume change, transitioning smoothly from a regular set of casual clothes into what could best be described as a bizarre and somewhat revealing bee outfit, complete with novelty wings. For his return to Ibiza, Cook once again joined up with the Manumission crew, now creating their unique brand of Mayhem in legendary superclub Amnesia. Here he shared the bill with Sheffield indie boys Arctic Monkeys and Radio One DJ Zane Lowe. In summer 2007, &quot;The Rockafeller Skank&quot; was used for season 3 of So You Think You Can Dance. In September 2007, the song was also featured on Konami&#x27;s Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2 for PlayStation 2. According to Norman&#x27;s regular &quot;Ask Norm&quot; segment on his MySpace, his untitled fifth studio album has Iggy Pop collaborating with him, and the album is &quot;seven-eighths finished&quot;. The recording process has been completed, but the record is yet to be mixed. There are 18 tracks on the record. Recently, the DJ was featured in the Closing Ceremony of the Summer 2012 Olympics, the XXX Olympiad, in London. ", "Bjork": "Bjork Gudmundsdottir, (born 21 November 1965), known mononymously as Bjork, is an Icelandic singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, producer and occasional actress. Her deeply personal music and lyrics, her precise arrangements and her unique voice have made her an important figure worldwide. Critics have consistently championed Bjork&#x27;s work, praising her innovative approach to singing and composition, her pioneering use of electronic beats, her groundbreaking music videos, and, above all, her singular voice, describing her as &quot;the most important and forward-looking musician of her generation&quot;. Bjork has developed an eclectic musical style that incorporates aspects of electronic, alternative rock, trip hop, jazz, classical, experimental and avant-garde music. Her record label, One Little Indian, reported in 2003 that she had sold more than 15 million albums worldwide. She has been nominated for 13 Grammy Awards, an Academy Award and two Golden Globe Awards (including one for acting). For her performance in Dancer in the Dark , Bjork won the Best Actress Award at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. She was ranked #36 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Greatest Women in Rock and Roll&quot; and #8 on MTV&#x27;s &quot;22 Greatest Voices in Music&quot;. Bjork was born and raised in Reykjavik, Iceland. Her musical career began when she was eleven with her study of classical piano in elementary school. One of her instructors sent a recording of Bjork singing Tina Charles&#x27; song I Love to Love to RUV, then the only radio station in Iceland. The recording was broadcast on national radio - after hearing it, a representative of the Falkinn label contacted Gudmundsdottir, to offer a record contract, and Bjork was recorded and released in 1977. In November 1979, her eponymous first album was released; the record contained covers of several pop songs, including the The Fool on the Hill and boasted artwork from her mother and guitar work from her stepfather. Bjork became a hit within Iceland and was not released in any other country. Bjork&#x27;s musical tastes were changed by the punk revolution of the late &#x27;70s; in 1979, she formed a post-punk group called Exodus and, in the following year, she sang in Jam 80. In her teens, Bjork was influenced by punk; at 14 she formed the all-girl punk band Spit and Snot, shortly followed by the jazz fusion group, Exodus in 1979. In 1980 she graduated from music school. In 1981 she and bassist Jakob Magnusson formed another band called Jam-80, which later became Tappi Tikarrass (which means &quot;Cork the Bitch's Ass&quot; in Icelandic), and released an extended single, &quot;Bitid Fast i Vitid in the same year. Their next album, Miranda, was released in 1983. Afterward, Bjork collaborated with Einar Orn Benediktsson and Einar Melax from Purrkur Pillnikk, and Gudlaugur Ottarsson, Sigtryggur Baldursson, and Birgir Mogensen from Theyr. After writing songs and rehearsing for two weeks, the new band, KUKL (&quot;sorcery&quot; in Icelandic), developed a sound described as Gothic rock. Bjork began to show indications of her trademark singing style, which was punctuated by howls and shrieks. KUKL toured Iceland with anarchist UK punk band, Crass, and later visited the UK in a series of performances with Flux of Pink Indians. They produced two albums as a result of these collaborations: The Eye in 1984, and Holidays in Europe in 1986, both on Crass Records. The band was eventually dissolved, in part due to the closure of their label, Gramm. In mid-1986, several members of KUKL and the surrealist group, Medusa, got together to create the arts collective Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). They created a musical division, a band again called KUKL, but soon changed the name to The Sugarcubes. Bjork first came to prominence as one of the lead vocalists of the avant-pop Icelandic sextet the The Sugarcubes, but when she launched a solo career after the group&#x27;s 1992 demise, she quickly eclipsed her old band&#x27;s popularity. Instead of following in the Sugarcubes&#x27; arty guitar rock styles, Bjork immersed herself in dance and club culture, working with many of the biggest names in the genre, including Nellee Hooper, Underworld, and Tricky. Debut, her first solo effort (except for an Icelandic-only smash released when she was just 11 years old), not only established her new artistic direction, but it became an international hit, making her one of the &#x27;90s most unlikely stars. The Sugarcubes became one of the rare Icelandic bands to break out of their native country when their debut album, Life&#x27;s Too Good, became a British and American hit in 1988. For the next four years, the group maintained a successful cult following in the U. K. and the U. S. while they were stars within Iceland. During 1990, Bjork recorded a set of jazz standards and originals with an Icelandic bebop group called Bjork Gudmundsdottir &amp; trio Gudmundar Ingolfssonar. The album, Gling-Glo, was released only in Iceland. By 1992, tensions between Bjork and Einar had grown substantially, which resulted in the band splitting apart. Following the breakup of the group, Bjork moved to London, where she began pursuing a dance-oriented solo career. The previous year, she had sung on Ooops, which sparked her interest in club and house music. She struck up a working relationship with Nellee Hooper, a producer who had formerly worked with Soul II Soul and Massive Attack. The first result of their partnership was Human Behaviour which was released in June of 1993. &quot;Human Behaviour&quot; became a Top 40 hit in the U. K. , setting the stage for the surprising number three debut of the full-length album, Debut. Throughout 1993, Bjork had hit U. K. singles &ndash; including Venus as a Boy, Big Time Sensuality, and the non-LP Play Dead, a collaboration with David Arnold taken from the film Young Americans &ndash; as well as modern rock radio hits in the U. S. She earned rave reviews in both countries. At the end of the year, NME magazine named Debut the album of the year. Additionally, she won BRIT Awards for both International Female Solo Artist and Newcomer. Debut went gold in the U. S. and platinum in the U. K. During 1994, Bjork was relatively quiet as she recorded her second album with Nellee Hooper, Tricky, 808 State&#x27;s Graham Massey, and Howie B of Mo&#x27; Wax Records. She also released a remix EP, co-wrote the title track for Bedtime Stories, and performed on MTV Unplugged that same year. Army of Me, the first single from Bjork&#x27;s forthcoming album, Post, was released as a teaser single in the spring of 1995. It debuted at number ten in the U. K. and became a moderate alternative rock hit in the U. S. Post, her second full-length solo album, was released in June of 1995 and garnered positive reviews. It peaked at number two in the U. K. and number 32 in the U. S. Post matched its predecessor in terms of sales and praise, going gold in the U. S. and helping her earn her second BRIT Award for Best International Female Artist. It yielded the British hit singles Isobel (#23), It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet (#4) and Hyperballad (#8). Despite her commercial success in the UK, her singles failed to make much headway on American radio or MTV. In late 1996, she released Telegram, an album of radically different remixes of the entire Post album, in the U. K. Its American release followed in January 1997. Homogenic was released on 23 September 1997 and spawned many remix releases in the next few years to follow. In the spring of 2000, she was named Best Actress by jurors at the Cannes Film Festival for her work in Lars von Trier&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or-winning Dancer in the Dark . Selmasongs, her score for the film, reunited Bjork with her Homogenic collaborator, Mark Bell, and arrived in Fall of 2000, just in time for Dancer in the Dark&#x27;s U. S. release. The full-length follow-up, Vespertine, was released one year later. Verspertine featured collaborations with electronic duo Matmos, who handled intricate micro-beats while Bjork layered her voice in melodic, lyrical passages. She released a Greatest Hits collection and the Family Tree box set late in 2002. After performing a few dates in 2003, Bjork worked on her all-vocals and vocal samples-based album, Medulla, and a performance of its first single, Oceania, at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The soundtrack to Drawing Restraint 9, a film by multimedia artist Matthew Barney, arrived in 2005 and also featured contributions from Will Oldham. Bjork also starred in the film, which would never see a DVD release and is only viewable in select art museums. Her next album, Volta, was released on 8 May 2007. Volta features collaborations with Timbaland, Mark Bell, and Antony Hegarty of Antony and the Johnsons. The album&#x27;s first single, Earth Intruders, was released digitally on 9 April 2007. Her most recent album, Biophilia, was released on the 5th of October, 2011, with Bjork and 16bit producing. \t\t She also sang on the contemporary classical composer John Tavener&#x27;s piece Prayer Of The Heart. Sites: MySpace . ", "Pixies": "Pixies are an American alternative rock band which formed in Boston, Massachusetts, United States in 1986. The band consists of Charles (Black Francis) Thompson IV (vocals, guitar; also known as &#x27;&#x27;Frank Black&#x27;&#x27;), Joey Santiago (lead guitar) and David Lovering (drums). Until 2013, the band also featured Kim Deal on bass and vocals. The band officially split in 1993 and reunited in 2004. They went on hiatus in 2007, with each band member pursuing projects of their own, only to reunite in 2009, with the announcement of a new tour commencing in Europe that summer. Although quite popular on alternative rock radio in the United States due to heavy airplay of the singles &quot;Monkey Gone to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;, they were never widely popular there, but found success in Europe, especially in the UK (where they managed three top 40 singles &quot;Velouria&quot;, &quot;Planet of Sound&quot; and a re-release of &quot;Debaser&quot;) and Belgium and the Netherlands, where they were heavily broadcasted by alternative public radio. The band&#x27;s style of alternative rock music is heavily influenced by punk and surf rock, and while highly melodic, is capable of being tremendously abrasive at the same time. Francis is the Pixies&#x27; primary songwriter and singer and has a distinctly desperate, yowling delivery. He has typically written cryptic songs about offbeat subjects, such as UFOs and surrealism. References to mental instability, violent Biblical imagery, and physical injury feature in many of the band&#x27;s songs. The group is frequently posited as the immediate forebear of the alternative rock boom of the 1990s, though they disbanded before reaping any of the benefits this might have brought them. Avowed fan Kurt Cobain&#x27;s acknowledgement of the debt Nirvana owed to the Pixies, along with similar tributes by other alternative bands, ensured that the Pixies&#x27; legacy and influence grew substantially in the years following their demise. In 1993, during an interview with BBC Radio 5, Black Francis announced that the band had split - something he had not told his bandmates. After the interview, he called Santiago, who in turn faxed Deal and Lovering the news the next morning. After the split, Black Francis inverted his stage name to Frank Black and embarked on a successful solo career, while Deal resumed her role in The Breeders with her identical twin sister Kelley. In 2004, the band reunited for a tour - documented in the film loudQUIETloud - and released a new single, &quot;Bam Thwok&quot; that summer. In 2007, Black Francis (now going by that name again) stated in an interview that the reunion was &quot;done&quot; even though the members remain in good terms with each other. In later interviews however, he began to mention that he might be willing to record another Pixies album. Nonetheless, Francis has returned to his solo career and Deal to the Breeders, both of which released albums and toured in 2008. Lovering and Santiago, meanwhile, set up their own project, a band called Everybody. In order to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of Doolittle, Pixies launched a tour in October 2009, on which they perform all the album&#x27;s songs and B-sides. In the autumn of 2011 the &quot;Lost Cities&quot; tour continued the &quot;Doolittle Tour&quot; as they played many venues for the first time. ", "Adam Lambert": "Adam Mitchel Lambert (born January 29, 1982) is an actor and singer-songwriter from San Diego, California, United States. He is known for his full-control three-octave (B2-B5) vocal range, expert vibrato and dynamic, piercing and robust belting and falsetto which allows him to stretch up to the fifth octave. In May 2009, he finished as the runner-up on the eighth season of American Idol , with &#x27; The Times &#x27; and other publishers identifying Lambert as the first openly gay pop/rock artist to launch a career on a major label in the U. S. Lambert released his debut album, &#x27; For Your Entertainment &#x27;, in November 2009, via RCA Records/19 Recordings. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200 in December 2009, selling 198,000 copies in the United States in the first week. To date, he is the first American Idol contestant to headline a world-wide tour in support of a debut album. As of January 2011, For Your Entertainment had sold more than 1. 2 million copies worldwide. In 2010, Lambert was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;Whataya Want from Me&quot;. His single &quot;If I Had You&quot;, also from that album, has additionally received major critical and commercial acclaim, Emboldened by his passionate fan-base, Lambert released his second studio album, &#x27; Trespassing &#x27;, in the U. S. on May 15th, 2012. Lambert served as an executive producer on the album, which the Better Than I Know Myself Songfacts reports him saying that it takes his fans on &quot;an exciting journey through the past two years&quot; of his life. The American Idol runner-up added, &quot;It&#x27;s been a transformative period and I really wanted to make music from what I&#x27;ve experienced. All these songs honestly explore the ups and downs of my reality. &quot; In terms of his vocal talents, Adam Lambert has been compared to past glam rock and hard rock legends such as Queen&#x27;s Freddie Mercury, Sweet&#x27;s Brian Connolly, and The Who&#x27;s Roger Daltrey. British rocker Brian May has had this to say about Adam's voice: &quot;I'm not easily moved to jelly by male vocalists&#8230; but Adam's voice reaches out with sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop all around the world&#8230; no doubt about it. The world of Rock has a bright new star. &quot; Website: http://www. adamofficial. com/us/home", "Michael Giacchino": "Michael Giacchino (pronounced juh-kee-no) (born 1967, Riverside, New Jersey) is an American soundtrack composer who has composed several multi-award winning scores for many popular movies, television series and video games. He attended the Evening Division at the Juilliard School, as well as the School of Visual Arts in New York City, where he acquired a degree in film production and a minor degree in History. Giacchino&#x27;s first major composition was for the DreamWorks video game adaptation of the 1997 movie, The Lost World: Jurassic Park . The video game was the first PlayStation (also on Sega Saturn) console title to be recorded with an original live orchestral score. Giacchino has since continued his relationship with DreamWorks, providing full orchestral scores for many of their popular videogames. Giacchino&#x27;s award-winning compositions covers the first four Medal of Honor series, ( Underground , Allied Assault and Frontline , along with the original Medal of Honor ). He has also provided scores for several other World War II-related video games like Secret Weapons Over Normandy , Call of Duty and Call of Duty: Finest Hour . Additionally, Giacchino wrote the main theme for Mercenaries while composer Chris Tilton provided the rest of the underscore. Giacchino also composed themes for The Incredibles: Rise of the Underminer , and co-wrote the theme from Black with composer Chris Tilton. He also composed the score for Alias , which was based on the television series of the same name. Michael has not been composing full soundtracks for video games in the past few years, but he is now going back to his roots as he is scheduled to score the music for a brand new world war II video game: Turning Point: Fall of Liberty . In 2007, Michael returned to the Medal of Honor franchise as he has composed the music for Medal of Honor: Airborne . Giacchino&#x27;s work on the various video games led to his first work on television first working on the pilot to the Steven Spielberg produced, Semper Fi . In 2001, J. J. Abrams, producer of the television series Alias , discovered Giacchino through his work on the video games and tapped Giacchino to provide the new show&#x27;s soundtrack. The soundtrack featured a mix of full orchestral pieces, often mixed with upbeat electronic music, a departure from much of his previous work. Giacchino would also provide the score for J. J. Abrams&#x27;s next project, the 2004 television series, Lost , which he continues to score today. This acclaimed soundtrack is notable for its multiple themes and leitmotifs, as well as the use of a real orchestra rather than synthesized instruments - an unusual choice in television scoring. In 2004, Giacchino was given his first big feature film composition, when he was called on to provide the soundtrack for the Pixar film, The Incredibles . Director Brad Bird had heard Giacchino&#x27;s work on Alias and asked him to work on the soundtrack for the new movie. The upbeat jazz orchestral sound was a departure in sound not only for Giacchino but for Pixar, who had previously relied on the works of Randy Newman and Thomas Newman for all of their previous films. Brad Bird had originally sought out John Barry, who was best known for composing many of the early James Bond movie soundtracks, to compose the music, but was reportedly unwilling to write music for an animated movie. Giacchino was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2005 for his work on The Incredibles : Best Score Soundtrack Album For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media and Best Instrumental Composition. Giacchino also composed scores for the 2005 films, Sky High , Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World and The Family Stone , and the television movie, The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz . Giacchino composed the score for the movie Mission: Impossible III , directed by J. J. Abrams, which was released on May 5, 2006. Giacchino then went on the compose the soundtrack for other Pixar films, Ratatouille and Up . Giacchino&#x27;s latest large scale composition was composing the score for the newest Star Trek movie in 2009. Additional Compositions In addition to his long list of soundtracks, in 2000 Giacchino was commissioned to write a concert piece in 3 movements performed by the Haddonfield Symphony called Camden 2000 . In 2005 Giacchino collaborated with Walt Disney Imagineering in creating two new soundtracks for the updated versions of Space Mountain at Disneyland, Disneyland Paris, and Hong Kong Disneyland. Giacchino was also contracted by Sarah Vowell, who played character Violet in The Incredibles , to compose the score to the audio version of her book Assassination Vacation . In 2001, Giacchino won the &quot;Academy of Interactive Arts and Science Award&quot; for Best Score for his work on Medal of Honor: Underground . His score to Medal of Honor: Frontline won two GANG awards; Music of the Year and Best Live Performance (&quot;Operation Market Garden&quot;). In 2004, Giacchino won the award of &quot;Excellence in Audio&quot; in the Game Developers Choice Awards for work on the video game, Call of Duty . Giacchino was nominated for two Grammy Awards in 2005 for his work on The Incredibles : Best Score Soundtrack Album For Motion Picture, Television Or Other Visual Media and Best Instrumental Composition. The Incredibles also won four awards for Best Score from the &quot;L. A. Film Critics Association&quot;, &quot;The International Film Music Critics Association&quot;, &quot;The Las Vegas Film Critics&quot; and &quot;The Annie Awards. &quot; In 2005 Michael received an Outstanding Music and Lyrics Emmy nomination for his song &quot;I&#x27;m With You&quot; from the television film, The Muppets Wizard of Oz . Cited by the New Yorker music critic Alex Ross as &quot;some of the most compelling film music of the past year,&quot; Giacchino&#x27;s work on Lost won him the 2005 Emmy for Music Composition For A Series (Dramatic Underscore).

", "Kelly Clarkson": "Kelly Brianne Clarkson (born April 24, 1982 in Fort Worth, TX) is a Grammy-winning American singer-songwriter and occasional actress. Clarkson recorded her debut album with RCA Records after having won the highly-publicized first season of the television series American Idol in 2002. Though originally marketed as a pop musician, she eventually developed a more rock-oriented image. Her debut album, Thankful, was released in 2003 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with almost 300,000 copies sold in its first week, now certified double platinum with over 4. 5 million copies sold. Her first single, A Moment Like This, broke the record for largest leap to #1, shooting from #52 to #1, where it remained for two weeks. The second single, Miss Independent, was also a success, hitting #1 on the US Top 40 Mainstream chart and remaining there for six weeks. Further singles Low and The Trouble With Love Is were released but failed to mimic the success of her previous songs. However, Low managed to become a hit in Canada and reached #2. To date, Thankful has been certified 2x Platinum in the United States, Platinum in Canada and Gold in Australia. Her second studio album, Breakaway, was released in 2004 and debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 and also at #3 in the UK album charts. It is her biggest selling album to date, selling over 6 million copies in the US and 15 million worldwide, making it the most successful album released so far by an American Idol alumnus. The first single in the US, Breakaway, peaked at #6 in the Billboard Hot 100 and #22 in the UK. Arguably her biggest single from the album, Since U Been Gone followed and peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #5 on the UK singles chart, marking the beginning of a successful worldwide music career for Clarkson. It won a Grammy award in 2006 for &quot;Best Female Pop Vocal Performance&quot;. Behind These Hazel Eyes was the next single, reaching #6 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #9 in the UK chart. Because Of You was then released to huge sucess, hitting #1 in 5 countries, peaking at #7 on both the Billboard Hot 100 and UK singles chart. Clarkson's final single, Walk Away, peaked at #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #21 on the UK singles chart. The album has been certified multi-platinum in at least 6 countries, going 7x Platinum in Ireland, 6x Platinum in the US and Australia, 5x Platinum in the UK and Canada, and 3x Platinum in New Zealand. The album won a Grammy award in 2006 for &quot;Best Pop Vocal Album. &quot; Clarkson's third album, entitled My December, was released in 2007. It peaked at #2 on the US and UK album charts. Her first single, Never Again, was released worldwide and reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #9 on the UK singles chart. She then released Sober in America, which did not perform as well on the charts as Never Again, peaking at #10 on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100. One Minute was subsequently released in Australia, peaking at #36 on the Australian singles chart. Don't Waste Your Time followed, peaking at #14 on the Australian singles chart. The album&#x27;s somewhat disappointing performance may be attributed to ongoing negative press and poor publicity. Nonetheless, My December has been certified Platinum in the US, Australia and Canada, and Gold in the UK and Ireland. Clarkson's fourth album titled All I Ever Wanted was released in early 2009. Debuting at #1, it received favourable reviews from critics worldwide. The lead single, My Life Would Suck Without You, advanced from #97 to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in its first week of release, breaking the record for the largest leap to the position in chart history. This marks the second time Clarkson has broken that record, the first time being with her single A Moment Like This. My Life Would Suck Without You also reached #1 in the UK charts, making it her first #1 there. Her second single from the album, I Do Not Hook Up, peaked at #20 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #36 on the UK singles chart.

All I Ever Wanted has charted at #1 in the US, #2 in Australia and Canada, #3 in the UK and #6 in New Zealand, selling over 1. 2 million copies worldwide so far. The album received a 2010 Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Pop Vocal Album. &quot; Mr. Know It All, the first single from Clarkson's fifth album Stronger, debuted on August 30, 2011 during a live webcast hosted by the singer. The song was sent to radio for adds immediately after and was made available for download on September 5, 2011. It has since peaked in the top 20 of singles charts worldwide, including a #1 peak in South Korea, #1 in Australia, #4 in the UK, and #10 in the US, thus becoming her ninth top ten hit overall in the US. Stronger was released worldwide on October 24, 2011, charting at #2 in the US, #5 in the UK, #3 in Australia, and #4 in Canada. Stronger is her fifth consecutive album to debut within the top 3 in the US and has sold over a million copies worldwide since its release. Stronger (What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You) was released in early 2012 to massive success; it became Clarkson&#x27;s third #1 and tenth top-ten hit overall in the US, and likewise peaked in the top ten of countries worldwide. Stronger (What Doesn&#x27;t Kill You) has since become Clarkson&#x27;s biggest radio hit to date in the US and even topped the Billboard Dance charts, making Clarkson the only artist in history to have a #1 on Hot 100, Pop, Country, HAC, AC &amp; Dance charts. Dark Side has since been announced and released as the album&#x27;s third single worldwide. In a career spanning over a decade, Clarkson has accumulated ninety-one number ones on the Billboard charts and eleven international number one singles, and has sold over 20 million albums worldwide. She is known for her vocal versatility and range. Her music has mainly dealt with themes of heartbreak, independence, and self-empowerment for women and young teens. Apart from her work in music, Clarkson has also ventured into television and film. Clarkson&#x27;s film debut was in the romantic musical From Justin to Kelly (2003) and she also appeared in American Dreams as Brenda Lee, in Reba, on The Voice as a guest advisor, on Duets as a mentor and judge. Clarkson&#x27;s musical work has also gained her numerous accolades, including three Grammy Awards, three MTV Video Music Awards, twelve Billboard Music Awards, four American Music Awards, two Academy of Country Music Awards, two American Country Awards, and a Women&#x27;s World Award. In 2012, Clarkson was ranked nineteenth on VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music. &quot; In 2013, Clarkson was ranked number 105 on Joel Whitburn&#x27;s &quot;Top 500 Artists Of All Time,&quot; number 5 on both &quot;Top Billboard 200 Female Artists&quot; and &quot;Adult Contemporary Artists,&quot; number 27 on &quot;Top Billboard 200 Artists,&quot; and number 75 on Billboard&#x27;s &quot;Hot 100: Top 100 Artists. &quot; Billboard also ranked Clarkson as the 14th-best-selling artist of the 2000s and one of the top 200 album sellers of the Nielsen SoundScan era at number 187. ", "UNISON SQUARE GARDEN": "2004 - Present. UNISON SQUARE GARDEN (yunizonsukueagaden) is a three-piece Japanese rock band that formed in April 2004 and signed to TOY&#x27;S FACTORY label. Their early releases were electropop-based, but over time become a rock style. UNISON SQUARE GARDEN were previously signed to the indie record label UK PROJECT. On July 23rd 2008, they made their major debut with the re-release of their demo single &quot;Sentimental Period&quot;. Members  * Saito Kousuke (Zhai Teng Hong Jie ): Vocal &amp; Guitar  * Tabuchi Tomoya (Tian Yuan Zhi Ye ): Vocal &amp; Bass  * Suzuki Takao (Ling Mu Gui Xiong ): Vocal &amp; Drums Even though they are young, they already have a number of live performances under their belts, making them a band worth having a look at!", "Ben Folds": "Benjamin Scott Folds (born September 12, 1966, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina) is an American singer-songwriter. He is widely known for his prowess as a pianist. Ben Folds&#x27; musical career started to get off the ground in the late &#x27;80s, as bassist for band Majosha, after playing bass and piano at Pinehurst, in a group known as the &quot;Caroliners&quot; with cohort Millard Powers in 1985-1987; he also played drums as a session musician in Nashville. As well as appearing in Pots &amp; Pans - now known as the Snuzz demo, as a pianist in Britt Harper Uzzell&#x27;s (aka Snuzz) band. Folds is best known for his later work as the frontman and pianist of Ben Folds Five and as a solo artist. Folds&#x27;s compositional and playing technique remain wholly unique, combining elements of the typical &#x27;singer/songwriter&#x27; genre, jazz, and power rock. Indeed, his music is evocative of artists such as Joe Jackson, Todd Rundgren, and Sir Elton John, with an added edge and bold infusion of energy and wit. Although his music has no distinctive genre with which it is associated, the terms piano rock and indie are often used to describe his unique style. It is worth noting that popular, piano-centric artists such as trio-based Keane and solo artist Matt Hales, a. k. a. Aqualung, began their rise to popularity after Ben Folds&#x27; three-member band, Ben Folds Five, broke up in 2000. The other two members of Ben Folds Five were Robert Sledge (bass) and Darren Jessee (drums). As of fall 2006, Ben Folds has released five solo LPs. His first album, Fear of Pop: Volume 1, an album of spoken word and instrumental compositions, was recorded and released while Ben Folds Five was still together. Since it was an uncharacteristic release, and officially released under the moniker of &#x27;Fear of Pop&#x27;, it is widely considered that his first &quot;proper&quot; solo album was Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs (2001), on which he played all the instruments by himself. A year later, in 2002, he released Ben Folds Live, a collection of live solo recordings. In late 2003, two solo EPs, Speed Graphic and Sunny 16, were released, with a third entitled Super D released in mid-2004. In 2005, Folds released a second studio album called Songs for Silverman. Most recently Folds has released the album &quot;Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the lp&quot; a compliation of his EPs, a The Bens track called &quot;Bruised,&quot; &quot;Still&quot; from the motion picture of 2006 &quot;Over the Hedge&quot; for which Folds wrote all the songs, his cover of the Dr. Dre song &quot;Bitches Ain&#x27;t Shit&quot;, and, with the kind permission of his good friend Neil Hannon, a cover of The Divine Comedy song &quot;Songs of Love&quot;. &quot;Supersunnyspeedgraphic, the lp&quot; otherwise includes remastered takes from the three internet EPs from 2002-2004. Ben claims that he wanted to have the CD in hard format so he could &quot;put it past him. &quot; Ben resides in Nashville with his wife, Fleur. He often tours the United States, the United Kingdom, other countries in Europe, Japan, and Australia. Folds&#x27; tours are famous for his solo act as &quot;Ben Folds and a piano&quot;, often having the audience become involved by &quot;playing&quot; the accompanying instruments (such as the trumpet and saxophone harmonies in &quot;Army&quot;) and singing choir-like backing vocals on &quot;Not the Same&quot;. His concerts are charismatic, yet calm - an enjoyable experience for most. And although Folds is constantly putting out new songs, his concerts rarely omit classic fan favorites such as &quot;Philosophy,&quot; &quot;One Angry Dwarf and 200 Solemn Faces,&quot; and &quot;Army. &quot; Also, a seemingly fan favorite that started in Chicago, IL was &quot;Rock this Bitch,&quot; a song where Folds has to come up an impromptu new tune with the words &quot;Rock this Bitch&quot; in it; though the song seems to be phasing out, it still makes appearances on tours, such as the November 2006 tour and the Spring US College tour of 2007 and 2008. Folds also produced and arranged the William Shatner album, Has Been (2004); he previously worked with Shatner on the songs &quot;In Love&quot; and &quot;Still in Love&quot; for Fear of Pop. Folds described his former band, Ben Folds Five, as &quot;punk rock for sissies,&quot; and his oddball lyrics often contain nuances of depression, melancholy and self-conflict. Folds also provided a number of songs for film soundtracks. Some of these include &quot;Lonely Christmas Eve&quot; for the Jim Carrey film How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (2000), and a rendition of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; for the film I Am Sam (2001). He (as The Bens) has also done charity compilations, from singing &quot;Wicked Little Town&quot; (from film and stage show Hedwig and the Angry Inch) on the benefit album &quot;Wig in a Box&quot; (2003) to appearing on No Boundaries, a benefit album for Kosovo refugees, with the song &quot;Leather Jacket. &quot; (written by Darren Jessee) On a planned tour of Australia, Folds teamed up with solo artists Ben Kweller and Ben Lee to travel the country together as The Bens, at the suggestion of a fan on Ben Kweller&#x27;s official website. The trio also went on to record a four-track EP together, entitled The Bens. In summer of 2004, Folds co-headlined an American tour with fellow rockers Rufus Wainwright and Guster. His second solo studio album, entitled Songs for Silverman, was released in the U. S. on April 26, 2005, featuring Jared Reynolds on bass, and Lindsay Jamieson on the drums, thus returning to the trio format, which had been so successful earlier, in earnest. This album includes the track &quot;Late,&quot; a tribute to the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, and also features backing vocals from &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic on &quot;Time. &quot; (Folds had played piano for Yankovic&#x27;s song &quot;Why Does This Always Happen to Me?&quot; and &quot;Weird Al&quot; directed Folds&#x27; music video for Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs). In January of 2007 Lindsay Jamieson left the band and was replaced by Sam Smith, of The Comfies on drums. Folds performed with Rufus Wainwright and Ben Lee in the summer of 2005 as part of the &quot;Odd Men Out&quot; tour. In addition, Folds has performed with many other famous musical names, including Weezer. Folds has also shown the complexity behind his authentic sound by performing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra, in March 2005, and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, in November 2005. A DVD recording of Folds playing with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra was released in December, 2005. Folds was the first artist to do a &quot;Live at Myspace&quot; concert, held on October 24, 2006 in his recording studio in Nashville, the show was an hour long and had requests from the internet submitted via Myspace&#x27;s Messenger. It also entailed several stunts, including a suicide attempt, and a falling audience member during &quot;Jesusland&quot;. The DVD of the broadcast (almost whole) was released in February of 2007. Folds supports the independent music scene, creating his own record label (Attacked By Plastic) and doing promotional work for independent record stores across the country. In 2008, September 16 marked the release of Amanda Palmer&#x27;s solo album which was produced by Folds. Two days following that release, Ben Folds Five had a one-time reunion concert held in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, the same place the band was formed. Weeks later, he released his third solo album entitled Way To Normal, released on September 30. Folds also recorded a fake album that was leaked intentionally during the summer to please fans and in an attempt to stop the real album from leaking. The fake tracks were recorded and mixed over a period of only several days. The leak contained 6 fake songs with names similar to the real songs or the album, and three songs from the actual release (except the song Cologne, which was an orchestral version of a song by the same name on the final album). Since December 2008, Folds has been collaborating with English novelist Nick Hornby, writing the music while Hornby writes the lyrics. This album was originally planned to be recorded over a course of 3 days, the same amount of time in which the fake album was recorded, but Folds has since been recording the album in a more standard format, albeit attempting to retain the live recording format. He has also played several songs from the upcoming album at live shows since mid-2009, and the album is slated to be released on September 27th of 2010. From December 14 through 21, 2009, Folds was featured as a judge on NBC&#x27;s a cappella competition The Sing Off alongside Nicole Scherzinger and Shawn Stockman and offered insightful, constructive comments and criticisms to the contestants. On the final show, in a departure from his a cappella purism, showcased his talents and played the roaring, riffing piano background on &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Friends?&quot; sung by the two finalist groups, Tufts Beelzebubs from Tufts University near Boston and Nota, from San Juan, Puerto Rico. He again returned for the show&#x27;s second season, and has been confirmed to return for the third season in September 2011 alongside Stockman and new judge Sara Bareilles. Recently Ben Folds was assumed to be the anonymous pianist playing songs to random ChatRoulette users, named &quot;Merton. &quot; Although Ben Folds has admitted to NOT being Merton, he paid tribute to the YouTube star at a concert in Charlotte in &quot;Ode To Merton. &quot;", "2PM": "2PM is a six member South Korean boy group which debuted under JYP Entertainment in 2008.

", "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (born Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart; 27 January 1756 - 5 December 1791) is among the most significant and enduring popular composers of European classical music. His enormous output includes works that are widely acknowledged as pinnacles of symphonic, chamber, piano, operatic, and choral music. Many of his works are part of the standard concert repertoire and are widely recognized as masterpieces of classical music. The central traits of the classical style can all be identified in Mozart&#x27;s music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are hallmarks, though a simplistic notion of the delicacy of his music obscures for us the exceptional and even demonic power of some of his finest masterpieces, such as the Piano Concerto No 24 in C minor, K. 491, the Symphony No 40 in G minor, K. 550, and the opera Don Giovanni. The famed writer on music Charles Rosen has written (in The Classical Style): &quot;It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart&#x27;s work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, Schumann&#x27;s superficial characterization of the G minor Symphony can help us to see Mozart&#x27;s daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart&#x27;s supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous. &quot; Especially during his last decade, Mozart explored chromatic harmony to a degree rare at the time. The slow introduction to the &quot;Dissonant&quot; Quartet, K. 465, a work that Haydn greatly admired, rapidly explodes a shallow understanding of Mozart&#x27;s style as light and pleasant. Born in Salzburg, Austria, from his earliest years Mozart had a gift for imitating the music he heard; which his father believed was a gift from God. Since he traveled widely, he acquired a rare collection of experiences from various bordels to create his unique compositional language. When he went to London as a child, he met J. C. Bach and heard his music; when he went to Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna, he heard the work of composers active there, as well as the spectacular Mannheim orchestra; when he went to Italy, he encountered the Italian overture and opera buffa, both of which were to be hugely influential on his development. Both in London and Italy, the galant style was all the rage: simple, light music, with a mania for cadencing, an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other chords, symmetrical phrases, and clearly articulated structures. This style, out of which the classical style evolved, was a reaction against the complexity of late Baroque music. Some of Mozart&#x27;s early symphonies are Italian overtures, with three movements running into each other; many are &quot;homotonal&quot; (each movement in the same key, with the slow movement in the parallel minor). Others mimic the works of J. C. Bach, and others show the simple rounded binary forms commonly being written by composers in Vienna. One of the most recognizable features of Mozart&#x27;s works is a sequence of harmonies or modes that usually leads to a cadence in the dominant or tonic key. This sequence is essentially borrowed from baroque music, especially Bach. But Mozart shifted the sequence so that the cadence ended on the stronger half, i. e. , the first beat of the bar. Mozart&#x27;s understanding of modes such as Phrygian is evident in such passages. As Mozart matured, he began to incorporate some more features of Baroque styles into his music. For example, the Symphony No. 29 in A Major K. 201 uses a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had just published his Opus 20 set. The influence of the Sturm und Drang (&quot;Storm and Stress&quot;) period in German literature, with its brief foreshadowing of the Romantic era to come, is evident in some of the music of both composers at that time. Over the course of his working life, Mozart switched his focus from instrumental music to operas, and back again. He wrote operas in each of the styles current in Europe: opera buffa, such as The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, or Cosi fan tutte; opera seria, such as Idomeneo; and Singspiel, of which Die Zauberflote is probably the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he developed the use of subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestration, and tone colour to express or highlight psychological or emotional states and dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted. His increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concerti served as a resource in his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was reflected in his later non-operatic compositions. ", "Nathaniel Rateliff & the Night Sweats": "", "Trivium": "Trivium is a heavy metal band which formed in Orlando, Florida, United States in 2000. The band currently consists of Matt Heafy (vocals, guitar), Corey Beaulieu (guitar), Paolo Gregoletto (bass) and Mat Madiro (drums). Heafy is the band&#x27;s only remaining original member. Since their formation, the band has released six studio albums. Trivium cross multiple heavy metal genres such as metalcore, thrash metal, progressive metal, alternative metal, groove metal, and death metal. Their style has evolved over the years from their earliest work on Ember to Inferno right through to In Waves. There is a clear thrash influence from Metallica and Machine Head, as well as some early In Flames. Trivium has stated that in general they are influenced by musical groups such as Metallica, Machine Head, and Iron Maiden. At his Lake Brantley High School talent show, frontman Matt Heafy performed a cover version of &quot;Self Esteem&quot; by The Offspring. Vocalist Brad Lewter noticed Heafy and asked him to try out for his band. The pair went over to drummer Travis Smith&#x27;s house where they played Metallica&#x27;s &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot;. Impressed with Heafy&#x27;s performance, they accepted him into the band known as Trivium. After several shows at bars and local clubs, Lewter quit the band and Heafy took over his position as vocalist. In early 2003, Trivium went into the recording studio to record its first high-quality demo disc. A copy of the demo was heard by German label Lifeforce, who signed Trivium. The band entered a studio to record its debut album, Ember to Inferno. As time went on, Corey Beaulieu joined. In 2004, Paolo Gregoletto joined as the band&#x27;s bassist to replace Brent Young, before a tour with Machine Head. The album Ember to Inferno managed to garner the interest of Roadrunner Records representatives, who later signed Trivium to a record deal. They then began writing songs for their major label debut. In 2004, Trivium recorded its second album, Ascendancy, in Audiohammer Studios and Morrisound Recording in Florida. Produced by Heafy and Jason Suecof, the album was released in March 2005. The album debuted at #151 on the Billboard 200 and at #4 on the Top Heatseekers chart. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus stated on Ascendancy, Trivium are a &quot;ridiculously tight quartet, unleashing thrilling dual guitar passages and pummeling kick drum gallops as surely as they do melodic breaks and vicious throat screams&quot; and Rod Smith of Decibel magazine praised &quot;Smith's impeccably articulated beats, bassist Paolo Gregoletto's contained thunder, and, especially, Heafy and guitarist Corey Beaulieu's liquid twin leads. &quot; The album was also recognized as the &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by Kerrang! magazine. Later in 2007 the band received their first Gold Record in the UK for more than 100,000 Sales. In April 2006, after a headlining tour featuring Mendeed and God Forbid as openers, Trivium entered the studio with Suecof and Heafy producing again. The band played the Download Festival again, this time on the main stage with Korn and Metallica. Trivium released The Crusade in October 2006. Debuting at number 25 on the Billboard 200, the album sold over 32,000 copies in its first week of sales. The album was a critical success, with Andy Greene of Rolling Stone claiming &quot;Nothing mars a good metal record like so-called harsh vocals&quot;and Don Kaye of Blabbermouth. net stating The Crusade &quot;is one of the best metal releases of 2006 and quite possibly the heavy music album of the year. &quot; On The Crusade, Heafy&#x27;s vocals changed from the metalcore scream that was featured on the band&#x27;s previous albums, to more singing on this album. This new singing style, along with the band&#x27;s thrash metal music were criticised of sounding too much like Metallica, who was a major influence on the band. Trivium started working on a new album with producer Nick Raskulinecz in October 2007. Heafy stated he wanted to bring back the screaming that was found on Ascendancy. The band stated they did not choose to work with Suecof again because they already recorded three albums with him and they wanted to explore new ideas. Recording ended June 2008. In an interview with the UK&#x27;s Metal Hammer magazine in May 2008, Matt Heafy stated that their new album was to have &quot;more thrash influences, more screaming and more raptors. Possibly more screaming because of the raptors. &quot; He told Revolver magazine, &quot;For the first time, we can&#x27;t look at our songs and say who the riffs sound like. We&#x27;re really making our own stuff and our own kind of music and art form, and that&#x27;s exciting. &quot; In September 2008, Trivium released their fourth full-length album,Shogun. The album sold 24,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release, and debut at number 23 on the Billboard 200 chart as well as Number 1 in the UK Rock Album Charts. On June 6, Metal Hammer revealed that the band have decided to entitle their upcoming album In Waves and that it would be released on August 9, 2011. On June 19, Trivium debuted two new songs live in Birmingham entitled &quot;Dusk Dismantled&quot; and &quot;Black&quot;. On the June 28 &quot;Dusk Dismantled&quot; was released to TriviumWorld users only; it was released to general public on the 29th. On July 13, the premiere of &quot;Inception of the End&quot; was released to the general public on the website Hot Topic. In Waves was released on August 2011 worldwide, and has received mixed reaction from both fans and critics. Kerrang! described the album as &quot;draws from the band&#x27;s entire repertoire and shapes what it finds into a defining and definitive set&quot;. A special edition was released featuring the tracks: &quot;Ensnare the Sun&quot;, &quot;A Grey So Dark&quot;, &quot;Drowning in Slow Motion&quot;, &quot;Slave New World&quot; cover and the single from the God of War III soundtrack &quot;Shattering the Skies Above&quot;. In March of 2012, Trivium bassist Paolo Gregoletto told Aussie magazine &quot;Loud&quot; , \"I think it's going to be heavier. We've been talking about it a lot, just a lot of stuff, like where we want to go with the next record. I think we've definitely learnt to write better on the road and we're learning that writing with a more focused vision musically is the way to go. Not just all of us just writing as many songs as we can. I think we're all trying to be conscious of how much we're writing, what we're writing and really just spending the time with a smaller batch of songs, rather than writing like 40 songs and kinda being all over the place musically. But it's definitely I think going to be a heavier record. \"I mean, the last record, we had so much time; we had like two years and we wrote an album over the course of two drummers, so it was like, when we started writing we were in a different headspace than when we actually recorded. So we had a lot of material, which was great. But I think now that things have smoothed out on the personal side of things for the band, I think we can focus solely on just the musical vision of what Trivium is and really have no, outside of the musical stuff we have nothing going on that's kinda like drawing from that. &quot; Trivium participated in a co-headlining trek with Swedish melodic death metal band In Flames in both Europe and North America. European support will come from Ghost and Rise to Remain and North American support will come from Veil of Maya and Kyng. They are confirmed to perform at the Metaltown Festival in June 2012. On January 14th 2013, Matt Heafy announced via Twitter that the band had entered the studio to commence recording for their sixth album, Vengeance Falls. The album was produced by David Draiman, famous for work in Disturbed and Device, and mixed by Colin Richardson in Austin, Texas. The first single from the album, &#x27;Brave This Storm&#x27;, was made available to download for free on July 31st of that year, and &#x27;Strife&#x27; and &#x27;No Way To Heal&#x27; were also released before the album came out on October 15th. The album featured three bonus tracks in a special edition; two originals and a cover of Misfits&#x27; Skulls and We Are 138. Vengeance Falls was criticised by some for Heafy&#x27;s different vocal techniques employed on the album, with many rooting the change in the influence of Draiman&#x27;s production. However, the instrumental prowess was praised by many. Incineration (The Broken World) features a bass guitar solo from Gregoletto, something that had not been seen on a studio album since Shogun. On May 7th 2014, it was announced that Nick Augusto left the band. His touring replacement has been drum tech Mat Madiro. Albums: Embers to Inferno (2003) Ascendancy (2005) The Crusade (2006) Shogun (2008) In Waves (2011) Vengeance Falls (2014) Bandmembers: Matt Heafy - guitar, lead vocals Corey Beaulieu - guitar, backing vocals Paolo Gregoletto - bass guitar, backing vocals Mat Madiro - drums Former members Brad Lewter - vocals Travis Smith - drums Brent Young - bass, guitar Nick Augusto - drums", "Widowspeak": "Widowspeak is a Brooklyn, New York, United States-based quartet that play hazy atmospheric dream pop and shoegaze, formed in 2010. There are aspects of the band&#x27;s sound - abrasive guitar hooks, immediate drumming, and incessant codas - that speak to living in a big city. But there&#x27;s also a dreary sparseness, a David Lynch-esque darkness, culled from the other members&#x27; native Washington. The band&#x27;s skeletal sound began to take shape, with Robert&#x27;s rust-belt guitar parts lending a restless, sinister edge to Molly&#x27;s subdued melodies and soft vocal style. Writing became a collaborative effort, and Widowspeak racked up an arsenal of songs. By fall the trio had recorded a six-track cassette using only a built-in laptop microphone and Garageband. The self-released October Tape, as it was called, fell into the hands of Brooklyn&#x27;s Captured Tracks. Weeks later, after only their sixth show, Widowspeak recorded the 7&quot; single Harsh Realm, in anticipation of a full LP. Their eponymous debut LP was released on August 9th, 2011 on Captured Tracks. http://widowspeak. bandcamp. com", "Scorpions": "Scorpions is a rock band from Hannover, Germany that was formed in 1965. Internationally acclaimed for their 1984 rock anthem &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot; as well as other popular singles such as &quot;Big City Nights&quot;, &quot;No One Like You&quot;, &quot;Send Me an Angel&quot;, &quot;Still Loving You&quot;, and &quot;Wind of Change&quot;, the band has sold over 100 million records worldwide. Along with metal contemporaries such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Whitesnake, and others, Scorpions is one of the most successful acts in heavy metal and hard rock in history as well as, by far, the most successful German rock band in the U. K. and the U. S. Rudolf Schenker, the band&#x27;s rhythm guitarist, once explained in an interview with Songfacts that: &quot;In the beginning of our career, we had a problem in Germany because nobody expects a German band to play rock music. With rock music, there are more bands from England or America, which are more exotic than the Scorpions, who are from Germany. But when we went to America in &#x27;79, we became the exotic ones. They said, &#x27;Hey, what kind of crazy guys are these?&#x27; We were already exotic, with a different view, and we also play our Rock music with a little bit of an ethnic touch. You&#x27;ll notice that Americans come from the blues side, whereas we come from the classical side, which is different. &quot; Formation and early history (1965-1973) Young German musician Rudolf Schenker set out to find his way in music in 1965. At first, his group was a school-kid outfit with British invasion influences, featuring Schenker himself on vocals. Things began to come together in 1969 when Schenker&#x27;s younger brother Michael and vocalist Klaus Meine joined the band. In 1972, the rock group recorded and released their debut album, titled &#x27; Lonesome Crow &#x27;, with Lothar Heimberg on bass and Wolfgang Dziony on drums. The album showcased a group that still was finding its voice lyrically and in style terms, thus picking up a muted reaction commercially. During the related tour for the album, Scorpions opened for up-and-coming British heavy metal outfit UFO. At the end of the tour, the members of UFO offered Michael Schenker the lead guitar job; the offer proved so tantalizing that he soon accepted. Musician Uli Jon Roth ended up being called in temporarily to finish off the tour. The departure of Michael Schenker led to Scorpions as a band going on hiatus. In 1973, Roth, a friend of the Schenker brothers serving in a band called Dawn Road, turned down the role as lead guitarist in Scorpions after Michael Schenker&#x27;s departure. Yet Roth invited Rudolf Schenker to join his own band instead. With a line-up established of Roth, Schenker, and Francis Buchholz (bass), Achim Kirschning (keyboards), and Jurgen Rosenthal (drums), Dawn Road felt primed for something huge. Roth even managed to get Klaus Meine to join the outfit before too long. Finally, even the &quot;Scorpions&quot; name came back as the guys wanted to build on the name&#x27;s past fame in the German hard rock scene.  Rise to widespread popularity (1974-1978) In 1974, the new line-up of Scorpions released an album titled &#x27; Fly to the Rainbow &#x27;. The release proved considerably more successful than their former album, with songs such as &quot;Speedy&#x27;s Coming&quot; and the title track establishing the band&#x27;s shift more and more away from psychedelic rock and towards aggressive, heavy-sounding music. Though sadly possessing what has been regarded as one of the worst album covers of all time, &#x27; Fly to the Rainbow &#x27; has additionally earned critical praise over the years. Achim Kirschning decided to leave after the recording came out for other opportunities, but he subsequently guested on keyboards for the next two albums. + Soon after, Jurgen Rosenthal had to leave as he was being drafted into the army, and was replaced by a Belgian drummer, Rudy Lenners. He later joined German progressive rock band called Eloy in 1976 and recorded three albums with them. It wasn&#x27;t until the following year that the band hit their stride with the release of In Trance. In Trance marked the beginning of Scorpions&#x27; long collaboration with German producer Dieter Dierks. The album was a huge step forward for Scorpions and firmly established their hard rock formula, while at the same time garnering a substantial fan base, both at home and abroad.  +  + In 1976, Scorpions released Virgin Killer. The album&#x27;s cover, which featured a fully nude prepubescent girl, brought the band considerable criticism and was ultimately pulled or replaced in several countries. In spite of the controversy - lead singer Klaus Meine even expressed shock - the album garnered significant praise from critics and fans alike. The following year, Rudy Lenners resigned due to health reasons and was replaced by Herman Rarebell. +  + The follow-up to Virgin Killer, Taken by Force, was the first Scorpions record to be aggressively promoted in the United States. The album&#x27;s single, &quot;Steamrock Fever&quot;, was added to some of RCA&#x27;s radio promotional records. Roth was not happy with the label&#x27;s efforts and the commercial direction the band was taking. Although he performed on the band&#x27;s Japan tour, he departed to form his own band, Electric Sun prior to the release of the resultant double live album Tokyo Tapes. Tokyo Tapes was released in the US and Europe six months after its Japanese release. By that time in mid 1978, Scorpions recruited new guitarist Matthias Jabs. +  + Commercial success and height of popularity (1979-1990)  +  + Following the addition of Jabs, Scorpions left RCA for Mercury Records to record their next album. Just weeks after being evicted from UFO for his alcohol abuse, Michael Schenker also returned to the group for a short period during the recordings of the album. The result was Lovedrive. Containing such fan favorites as &quot;Loving You Sunday Morning&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, the &quot;Scorpions formula&quot; of hard rock songs mixed in with melodic ballads was firmly cemented. Lovedrive peaked at #55 on the US charts proving that Scorpions were gathering an international following. After the completion and release of the album, the band decided to retain Michael in the band, thus forcing Matthias Jabs to leave. But after a few weeks of the tour, Michael, still coping with alcoholism, kept missing a few gigs and Matthias Jabs was brought back to fill in for him on those occasions when he couldn&#x27;t perform. In April 1979, during their tour in France, Matthias Jabs was brought in permanently to replace Michael Schenker. +  + In 1980, the band released Animal Magnetism, again with a provocative cover showing a girl kneeling in front of a man&#x27;s crotch. While Animal Magnetism contained classics such as &quot;The Zoo&quot; and &quot;Make It Real&quot;, it was a critical disappointment when compared with Lovedrive.  +  + The band then began working on their next album. Blackout was released in 1982 and quickly became the band&#x27;s best selling to date, eventually going platinum. Blackout spawned three hit singles: &quot;Dynamite,&quot; &quot;Blackout&quot; and &quot;No One Like You&quot;. +  + It was not until 1984 and the release of Love at First Sting that the band finally cemented their status as rock superstars. Propelled by the single &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot;, Love at First Sting went up the charts and went double platinum a few months after its release. MTV gave the album&#x27;s videos &quot;Rock You Like a Hurricane&quot;, &quot;Bad Boys Running Wild&quot;, &quot;Big City Nights&quot;, and the power ballad &quot;Still Loving You&quot; significant airtime, greatly contributing to the album&#x27;s success. +  + The band toured extensively behind Love at First Sting and decided to record and release their second live album, World Wide Live. Recorded over a year long period and released at the height of their popularity, the album was another success for the band, peaking at #17 on the charts. +  + After their extensive world tours, the band finally returned to the studio to record Savage Amusement. Released in 1988, four years after their previous studio album, Savage Amusement represented a more polished pop sound similar to the style Def Leppard had found success with.  +  + On the Savage Amusement tour in &#x27;88, Scorpions became only the second Western group to play in the Soviet Union (the first being Uriah Heep in December 1987), with a performance in Leningrad. The following year the band returned to perform at the Moscow Music Peace Festival. +  + Wishing to distance themselves from the Savage Amusement style, the band separated from their long-time producer and &quot;Sixth Scorpion,&quot; Dieter Dierks, ultimately replacing him with Keith Olsen when they returned to the studio in 1990. Crazy World was released that same year and displayed a less polished sound. The album was a hit, propelled in large part by the massive success of the ballad &quot;Wind of Change&quot;.  +  + Later days (1991-present)  +  + After the release of Crazy World Francis Buchholz, the band&#x27;s long-serving bassist, left the group. Replacing him was Ralph Rieckermann who handled bass duties until 2002.  +  + In 1993 Scorpions released Face the Heat. For the recording process, Scorpions brought in producer Bruce Fairbairn. The album&#x27;s sound was more metallic than melodic. Face the Heat was a moderate success. +  + In 1995, a new live album, Live Bites, was produced. The disc documented live performances from their Savage Amusement Tour in 1988, all the way through the Face the Heat Tour in 1994. While the album had a much cleaner sound in comparison to their best-selling live album, World Wide Live, it was not as successful. +  + Prior to recording their 13th studio album, 1996&#x27;s Pure Instinct, drummer Herman Rarebell left the band to set up a recording company. Curt Cress and Pitty Hecht took charge of the drumsticks for the album before James Kottak took over permanently.  +  + 1999 saw the release of Eye II Eye and a significant change in the band&#x27;s style, mixing in elements of pop and techno. While the album was slickly produced, fans were unsure what to make of the band, responding negatively to almost everything from pop-soul backup singers to the electronic drums present on several songs. The video to the album&#x27;s first European single, &quot;To Be No. 1&quot;, featured a Monica Lewinsky lookalike which did little to improve its popularity. +  + The following year Scorpions had a fairly successful collaboration with the Berlin Philharmonic that resulted in a 10-song album named Moment of Glory. The album went a long way towards rebuilding the band&#x27;s reputation after the harsh criticism of Eye II Eye.  +  + In 2001, Scorpions released Acoustica, a live unplugged album featuring acoustic reworkings of the band&#x27;s biggest hits, plus new tracks. While appreciated by fans, the lack of a new studio album was frustrating to some, and Acoustica did little to return the band to the spotlight. +  + In 2004, the band released Unbreakable, an album that was hailed by critics as a long awaited return to form. The album was the heaviest the band had released since Face the Heat, and fans responded well to tracks such as &quot;New Generation&quot;, &quot;Love &#x27;em or Leave &#x27;em&quot; and &quot;Deep and Dark&quot;. Whether a result of poor promotion by the band&#x27;s label or the long time between studio releases, Unbreakable received little airplay and did not chart. Scorpions toured extensively behind the album, and played as special guests with Judas Priest during the 2005 British tour. +  + In early 2006, Scorpions released the DVD 1 Night in Vienna that included 14 live tracks and a complete rockumentary.  +  + In May of 2007, Scorpions released Humanity - Hour 1 in Europe. Humanity - Hour 1 became available in the U. S. on August 28, 2007 on New Door Records, entering the Billboard charts at number #63.  +  + 24 JANUARY 2010 + Scorpions announce retirement. + it was always our pleasure, our purpose in life, our passion and we + were fortunate enough to make music for you - whether it was live on + stage or in the studio, creating new songs.  +  + While we were working on our album these past few months, we could + literally feel how powerful and creative our work was - and how much + fun we were still having, in the process.

Since then they have broken music and concert sale records, having sold more than 180 million albums (38 million in the United States. ) to make them the highest-selling boy band on record. The group originally consisted of Nick Carter, Howard Dwaine &#x27;Howie&#x27; Dorough, Brian Littrell, Kevin Richardson, and AJ McLean. Their debut album, Backstreet Boys , was released in 1996. The album debuted at #1 in Germany, Norway, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Finland, Austria, and Canada and sold over 38 million copies worldwide (14 million copies in the U. S. ) setting a record for the most successful debut album in history. In some countries, they&#x27;ve also released a second album, Backstreet&#x27;s Back . In May 1999, the Backstreet Boys released the album Millennium , which sold over 1. 13 million units in its first week, setting a record for most albums sold in the first week of release. They also held the most sales for an album&#x27;s second and third weeks. The record dominated the worldwide charts, landing at the #1 spot in 25 countries. The album was certified 11 times platinum by December 1999, making it the fastest selling album in a year. The album went on to sell over 43 million copies worldwide. Released in November 2000, their album Black &amp; Blue , whose 13-song selection features five songs co-written by members of the group, plus two songs written by all five Backstreet Boys, achieved platinum status in over 30 countries and gold certification in 10 regions around the world during its first week of release with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide. In October 2001, the boys released The Hits: Chapter One , a disc of their greatest hits and Drowning , their last single until their return in 2005. After a five-year hiatus, their new single, Incomplete , was released to radio stations on March 28, 2005 and quickly became the #1 most requested song in top markets in both U. S. and overseas. The song was a drastic change from their previous albums, switching to adult contemporary rather than pop. On June 14, 2005, the Backstreet Boys released their comeback album Never Gone , which they spent more than a year recording. It has sold over 13 million copies worldwide. On June 24, 2006, Kevin Richardson left the band on good terms to pursue personal projects. The group said that they won&#x27;t close the door to Kevin and whenever he wants to go back, he&#x27;s welcome. The now four have released on October 30th their sixth album, called Unbreakable . On October 30,2007, BSB madness was back in Times Square for the boys. They have proven time and time again in the industry that they are &quot;unbreakable&quot; and the bond they have for their fans is unbreakable. They started touring in February 2008. Their Unbreakable Tour has been a big success! Their new album This Is Us released on October 6th, 2009. They worked with Max Martin, OneRepublic singer Ryan Tedder, RedOne, Ne-Yo, Brian Kennedy, Pitbull, Claude Kelly, Jim Jonsin, Eddie Galan, T-Pain, Rami Yacoub, Kristian Lundin, many others on the album. On January 26, 2010, they released a second greatest hits album titled, Playlist: The Very Best of the Backstreet Boys and is part of a series of similar Playlist albums issued by Sony Legacy. ", "Sufjan Stevens": "Sufjan Stevens (pronounced &quot;SOOF-yahn&quot;; born July 1, 1975) is an American musician, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist from Petoskey, Michigan. He is known for his lyrically focused and instrumentally rich songs that often relate to faith and family. He has enjoyed wide critical success in the United States. He is considered part of the folk revival through indie pop, but his influences are very broad, including experimental electronic music, the jazz of Vince Guaraldi, and the academic minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass. Though Stevens had announced plans to make an album for each of the 50 U. S. states, beginning the series with the albums &#x27; Michigan &#x27; (2003) and Come On Feel The Illinoise! &#x27; (2005, officially named just &#x27; Illinois &#x27;), he has since then somewhat retracted the statement. &quot;Sufjan Stevens is not going to write a record for each of the 50 states after all&quot; was the original text included on the online liner notes for &#x27; Mews Too: An Asthmatic Kitty Compilation &#x27; , a disc released on February 7, 2006. This statement was possibly included as a joke, as the text has since been removed and the current liner notes related to Sufjan Stevens reads: &quot;Sufjan Stevens can fold a fitted-sheet (he once worked as a professional folder in a commercial Laundromat). &quot; Background Stevens was born in Detroit, Michigan, and grew up in the city of Petoskey in that same state. He attended Hope College on the west coast of Michigan. The name Sufjan is an Arabic / Persian name that predates Islam and most famously belonged to Abu Sufyan, a figure from early Islamic history. It has been mentioned in the press that the name was given to Stevens by the leader of Subud, a spiritual sect to which his parents belonged when he was born. Stevens has stated that the name is of Armenian origin and means &quot;comes with a sword,&quot; and that it is &quot;a charming militaristic Muslim name. &quot; In fact the name is not Armenian, and Armenia is a predominantly Christian country. Sufjan is also the plural form of Sufi in Persian . Sufi is a practitioner of Sufism . This word is frequently used in the old Persian literature ,specially Sufi poetry . His brother, marathonist Marzuki Stevens, has trained to compete in the 2008 Olympic trials, and has played on two of Sufjan&#x27;s albums. A multi-instrumentalist, Stevens plays the banjo, guitar, drums, and several other instruments, often playing all of these on his albums through the use of multi-tracking. While in school, he studied the oboe and English horn, which he also plays on his albums; he is one of the few musicians in popular music to use these instruments. Career Sufjan Stevens began his musical career as a member of Marzuki, a folk-rock band from Holland, Michigan. He also played (and continues to play) various instruments for Danielson Famile. While in school at Hope College, Stevens wrote and recorded his debut solo album, A Sun Came , which he released on Asthmatic Kitty Records, a record label he founded with his step-father in 1999. He later moved to New York City, where he was enrolled in a writing program at the New School for Social Research. While in New York, Stevens composed and recorded the music for his second album, Enjoy Your Rabbit , a song cycle based around the animals of the Chinese Zodiac that ventured into electronica. Stevens followed this with the first of his 50 states albums, a collection of folk songs and instrumentals inspired by his home state of Michigan. The result, the expansive Michigan , included odes to cities including Detroit and Flint, the Upper Peninsula, and vacation areas such as Tahquamenon Falls. Melded into the scenic descriptions and characters are his own declarations of faith in God, sorrow, love and the regeneration of Michigan. Following the release of Michigan, Stevens compiled a collection of songs recorded previously into a side project, the Christian folk album Seven Swans , which was released in March 2004. Next he released the second in the 50 states projects, entitled Come On Feel The Illinoise! . Among the subjects explored on Come On Feel The Illinoise! are the cities of Chicago, Decatur and Jacksonville, the serial killer John Wayne Gacy , the poet Carl Sandburg , and Mississippi Palisades State Park. He has contributed to the music of Denison Witmer, Soul Junk, Half-handed Cloud, Brother Danielson, Danielson Famile, Serena Maneesh, Castanets, and Liz Janes. He played piano on for fellow Brooklyn musician&#x27;s The National&#x27;s album 2007 Boxer. A cover of &quot;She Is&quot; is included on the album Dream Brother , released in the United States on January 31, 2006. Sufjan contributed a lot to the sound of the 2001 Liz Janes album Done Gone Fire as he engineered, recorded, produced and arranged it as well as playing many addition instruments. Sufjan recently recorded with Rosie Thomas and Denison Witmer playing banjo and providing vocals. It is unknown how this record will be released. In April 2006, Pitchfork erroneously announced that Stevens and Thomas were having a baby together, but were forced to print a retraction. Witmer and Thomas later admitted it was an April Fools&#x27; prank. The Fifty States Project Beginning with Michigan, Stevens announced an intent to write an album for each of the 50 U. S. states, although in interviews he wavers between utter sincerity and self-deprecating irony when describing the idea. Stevens spent the second half of 2004 researching and writing material for the second of these projects, this time focusing his efforts on Illinois. As with Michigan , Stevens used the state of Illinois as a leaping-off point for his more personal explorations of faith, family, love, and location. The widely acclaimed Come On Feel The Illinoise! was the highest rated album of 2005 on the Metacritic review aggregator site, based on glowing reviews from Pitchfork, The Onion A/V Club, Spin, Billboard, Entertainment Weekly, Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and The Guardian. The 2006 PLUG Independent Music Awards awarded Stevens with the Album Of The Year, Best Album Art/Packaging, and Male Artist Of The Year. Pitchfork Media and Paste Magazine named Come On Feel The Illinoise! as the editors&#x27; choice for best album of 2005 and Stevens received the 2005 Pantheon prize, awarded to albums selling 500,000 copies or fewer, for Come On Feel The Illinoise! . In April of 2006, Stevens announced that 21 pieces of music he had culled from the Come On Feel The Illinoise! recording sessions would be incorporated into a new album, called The Avalanche . The album was released on July 11, 2006. The next states to be taken on in the project have been reported as Oregon and Rhode Island. Minnesota may be another candidate; in late 2005 and early 2006 Stevens played a new instrumental track titled &quot;The Maple River. &quot; The Maple River mentioned in the title of the song runs through several counties in southern Minnesota. Sufjan also recorded &quot;The Lord God Bird&quot;--a song about the ivory-billed woodpecker rediscovered in Arkansas (known as the &#x27;lord god&#x27; or &#x27;great god&#x27; bird because of its breathtaking appearance)--in connection with a National Public Radio piece in which &quot;independent radio producers Dan Collison and Elizabeth Meister were curious about how Stevens writes his songs. &quot; Religious themes Many of Stevens&#x27; songs have religious and spiritual allusions, but his album Seven Swans has the most direct religious references. Stevens has expressed that he is Christian , but does not overtly advertise this aspect of himself in his music. Stevens has also stated that he does not try to make music &quot;with a message&quot;, or music for the sake of preaching. &quot;I don&#x27;t think music media is the real forum for theological discussions,&quot; says Stevens. &quot;I think I&#x27;ve said things and sung about things that probably weren&#x27;t appropriate for this kind of forum. And I just feel like it&#x27;s not my work or my place to be making claims and statements, because I often think it&#x27;s misunderstood. &quot; The songs &#x27;Abraham&#x27;, &#x27;Seven Swans&#x27;, &#x27;To Be Alone With You&#x27;, &#x27;We Won&#x27;t Need Legs To Stand&#x27; and &#x27;The Transfiguration&#x27; directly address Christianity on the album Seven Swans . In &#x27;Abraham&#x27;, Sufjan recounts the Old Testament story in the Book of Genesis when Abraham, ordered by God as a test of faith, leads his son, Isaac, up a mountain and prepares to kill him, as commanded (but before God sends an angel to intervene). The lyrics of &#x27;The Transfiguration&#x27; follow the Biblical accounts of Jesus&#x27; Transfiguration in Matthew 17:1-8, Mark 9: 1-8, and Luke 9:28-36. Michigan and Come On Feel The Illinoise! are packed with Christian references and metaphors. Michigan contains &quot;Sleeping Bear, Sault Saint Marie&quot;, which implores &quot;Oh Lamb of God! Tell us Your perfect design and give us the rod&quot; (&quot;Lamb of God&quot; being a Biblical name for Jesus Christ). The song &quot;Oh God, Where Are You Now?&quot; asks God to &quot;hold me now&quot;, to &quot;save somehow&quot;, searching for God in the midst of personal turmoil. &quot;There&#x27;s no other man who could save the dead,&quot; the song states. The album closer, &#x27;Vito&#x27;s Ordination Song&#x27;, was apparently originally written for Sufjan&#x27;s friend Vito Aiuto, and its lyrics allude directly to Psalm 139 (&quot;I always knew you. In your mother&#x27;s arms, I have called your name&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve made a crown for you&quot;). The song speaks of &quot;When the bridegroom comes&quot; - the New Testament speaks of Jesus Christ as being the Bridegroom and the Church His Bride, finally being united together at the End of Time. Come On Feel The Illinoise! features the song &#x27;Chicago&#x27; with its refrain of &quot;You came to take us, to recreate us&quot;, and &#x27;Decatur&#x27; has the chorus of &quot;It&#x27;s the great I Am&quot; (&quot;I Am&quot; being the name the Lord reveals Himself by to Moses in Exodus 3:14). &quot;Casimir Pulaski Day&quot; speaks of &quot;All the glory that the Lord has made&quot; in the midst of personal pain and loss. &quot;The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out To Get Us!&quot; has the lyrics: &quot;Lamb of God, we sound the horn. Hallelujah!&quot; One instrumental passage has the title of &quot;In This Temple as in the Hearts of Man for Whom He Saved the Earth&quot;. &quot;The Seer&#x27;s Tower&quot; speaks of Emanuel, &quot;With His sword, with His robe He comes dividing man from brothers&quot; (an interesting side note is that &quot;Sufjan&quot; actually means &quot;comes with a sword&quot;). Indeed, the vast majority of songs of Come On Feel The Illinoise! contain lyric lines which can be readily identified as having a basis in Stevens&#x27; faith in Christ. Sufjan&#x27;s second, electronic album, Enjoy Your Rabbit , contains a song cycle based on of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac, culminating with the song &quot;Year of our Lord&quot;. Stevens released the original, Christian-themed song &quot;God&#x27;ll Ne&#x27;er Let You Down&quot; on the &quot;To Spirit Back the Mews&quot; compilation on Asthmatic Kitty. The officially unreleased Christmas albums Sufjan Stevens made and then compiled into Songs for Christmas feature suitably Christmas and Christian themed music, both originals and covers of hymns and traditional songs. Trivia On Snow Patrol&#x27;s 2006 album Eyes Open there is a reference to Sufjan and the song &quot;Chicago&quot; in the song &quot;Hands Open&quot; - &quot;Put Sufjan Stevens on and we&#x27;ll play your favorite song/&quot;Chicago&quot; bursts to life and your sweet smile remembers you. &quot; The film &quot;Little Miss Sunshine&quot; featured pieces of two songs from Come on Feel the Illinoise in its soundtrack. Sufjan has twice been featured on the FOX television show &quot;The OC&quot;. &quot;To Be Alone With You&quot; and &quot;For The Widows In Paradise, For The Fatherless In Ypsilanti&quot; can be heard on episodes 202 and 315, respectively.

In the summer of 2002 it was announced that MF DOOM and Madlib were working together on a project which, at that time, had no title or projected release date. The two first met up at the Stones Throw house in Los Angeles where Madlib&#x27;s studio The Bomb Shelter existed in a former 1950s-era bomb shelter. Doom immediately immersed himself in Madlib&#x27;s music and began writing lyrics and recording demos. He would continue revising lyrics and re-recording vocals for over a year. Madlib took off to Brazil in late 2002 for the Red Bull Music Academy, where early cuts of Madvillain were premiered for the first time. (These demos were also copied and subsequently bootlegged - and the demos were later released on Madvillainy 2: The Box). Back in Los Angeles, in mid-2003, DOOM &amp; Madlib took over a bedroom to record vocals. First released was the Money Folder b/w America&#x27;s Most Blunted 12-inch single in the Fall of 2003. Their debut album, Madvillainy, was released in March 2004. The music on Madvillainy went against the grain of all popular conventions in contemporary hip-hop: short songs, dirty sound, no choruses, and with lyrical themes which were not always clear to everyone on first listen. The album received the highest critical praise of a hip-hop album released in 2004, and years later has continued to generate interest and controversy. In 2005, two remix EPs from Madvillainy were released on Stones Throw, including Four Tet Remixes and Koushik Remixes. MF DOOM went on to work with DANGERDOOM (with Danger Mouse), Gorillaz and Ghostface Killah. Madlib has continued developing his diverse production style for the likes of Erykah Badu, Talib Kweli, Ghostface Killah, as well as releasing several solo products under his own name and self-made creations Quasimoto, Yesterday&#x27;s New Quintet, and Beat Konducta. In 2008, prolific as usual, Madlib remixed Madvillainy in its entirety, titled Madvillainy 2: The Madlib Remix. It was released in a limited edition box set in 2008. DOOM and Madlib have worked on a second Madvillain album on and off for several years. If you&#x27;re waiting for it, wait in line behind us. ", "Red Baraat": "Led by dhol player Sunny Jain, Red Baraat delivers a riveting new sound that is coupled with an explosive stage performance and presence. Comprised of dhol (double-sided, barrel-shaped North Indian drum slung over one shoulder), drumset, percussion, sousaphone, and 5 horns, Red Baraat melds the infectious North Indian rhythm Bhangra with a host of sounds, namely funk, go-go, Latin and jazz. The NYC-based group is quickly gaining fans across the world because of the experience they bring their audiences. After the group's performance at the 2011 globalFEST, Red Baraat was a top pick favorite and featured on PRI's The World, NPR's All Songs Considered, New York Times, The Village Voice and Mother Jones magazine. Red Baraat's debut CD, Chaal Baby (Sinj Records) was received with an overwhelming positive response and was voted by several music critics as a top world and jazz release of 2010. Since their inception in October 2008, Red Baraat has delivered blistering performances at globalFEST, Montreal Jazz Festival, Chicago World Music Festival, Lincoln Center, The Kennedy Center, Madison World Music Festival, Concert of Colors (Detroit), Droma Gypsy Festival, Pori Jazz Festival (Finland), Molde Jazz Festival (Norway) and Chicago Folks &amp; Roots Festival, among many others. Red Baraat appeared on John Schaefer&#x27;s Soundcheck WNYC-FM 93. 9, an NPR affiliate, in which they were picked as a top live radio performance of 2009. They also recorded the credit roll theme song for the movie, The Yes Men Fix the World and performed at the 2009 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week (NYC) for Ports 1961 runway models. Red Baraat has been featured in National Geographic, Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, Relix and Songlines, among many others and is presently working on their follow up CD, Shruggy Ji, to be released in early 2012. ", "Spiritualized": "Spiritualized are an English rock band formed in 1990 in Rugby, Warwickshire, United Kingdom by Jason Pierce, who often goes by the alias J. Spaceman, after the spectacular demise of the Spacemen 3 outfit. The membership of Spiritualized changes from album to album, with Pierce being the only constant factor. The first Spiritualized release was a space rock-esque cover of Any Way That You Want Me in 1990, a record which heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band&#x27;s name. Of the final Spacemen 3 line up, bassist Will Carruthers, drummer Jonny Mattock and session guitarist Mark Refoy joined Pierce in the first phase of Spiritualized (for the debut LP, Lazer Guided Melodies), alongside his then girlfriend Kate Radley. None of the original line up remains - Carruthers tried for a solo career, Mattock played for a spell in The Breeders (and later Lupine Howl), Refoy formed Slipstream(his replacement was John Coxon) and Radley married Richard Ashcroft of The Verve. A later cohort of Spiritualized backing musicians - Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney - formed Lupine Howl following summary dismissal by Pierce. Sax player Ray &#x27;Moonshake&#x27; Dickaty was added to the lineup in 1997, and Gregg Hale (guitar) also augmented the band in 1997 and 1998. Retaining only keyboardist Thighpaulsandra (keyboards)a replacement for Kate Radley, Jason Pierce then debuted a new (and current) line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former Julian Cope string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of Brain Donor and the Julian Cope band, and drummer Kevin &#x27;Kevlar&#x27; Bales who is also ex-Julian Cope band. Ray Dickaty departed in 2003, quitting to play in the free-jazz Solar Fire Trio. The remaining line-up finished recording the album Songs In A&amp;E in Nottingham and London. The musical style of Spiritualized can perhaps be best described as psychedelic rock, especially earlier albums like Lazer Guided Melodies and Pure Phase, which also incorporated elements of the shoegazing style made popular by influential 1991 album Loveless. The landmark Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space showed influences from African-American gospel and blues beginning to creep in, and wall of sound influences from Phil Spector and Brian Wilson began to predominate, which came to a head on Let It Come Down. Amazing Grace favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and soul influences heavier than ever. For several years (ending in or about 1999), Spiritualized were the only active artist signed to Dedicated Records, a British independent label which had, by then, been acquired by Spiritualized&#x27;s then-label, Arista Records. On 15 June 1997, Spiritualized became the last band to play at Factory Records&#x27; Manchester nightclub The Hacienda. After several years of work and Pierce&#x27;s serious illness in July 2005,the album, Songs in A&amp;E was released on 26 May 2008 in the UK, and on 27 May 2008 in the US. The first single from the 18-track album was &quot;Soul On Fire&quot;. The release was backed by an Electric Mainlines UK tour which began in May. Pierce has also scored Harmony Korine&#x27;s 2008 film Mister Lonely. In October and December 2009 the band performed 1997&#x27;s Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space live in its entirety as part of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties-curated Don&#x27;t Look Back series. After more than two years in the making, while Pierce was undergoing experimental chemotherapy for a liver disease, and including a year long period of mixing, Sweet Heart Sweet Light was released in April 2012, on Double Six Records. The band had already played some of this new material over the past 3 years but not much else was known about the content of the album. The album cover, an octagon surrounding the word &quot;Huh?&quot; on a plain white background, is a reference to the working title of the album. In an interview regarding the new release it was revealed that the album would &quot;embrace&quot; more poppy songs compared to previous albums. In the same interview, Jason Pierce also said that the album was partly inspired by the experiences of performing &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space&quot; live in its entirety", "Fall Out Boy": "Fall Out Boy is a band formed in 2001 in Glenview, Illinois after good friends Joe Trohman and Pete Wentz met high schooler Patrick Stump. Stump originally auditioned as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer. The following year, the band debuted with a self-released demo and followed it up with the May 28, 2002 release of Split EP, which featured Project Rocket, on Uprising Records. The group released a mini-LP, Evening Out With Your Girlfriend, also on Uprising Records, in 2003. 2003-2004: Independent success After the release of their mini-album, Fall Out Boy built a large cult following playing in the Chicago area and drummer Andy Hurley, formerly of Racetraitor, joined the band while the two other members left. At this time, Stump also took over rhythm guitar duties. During this time, they played many local shows at the The Knights of Columbus Hall in Arlington Heights, Illinois, also the site of their first video: Dead On Arrival. The same year, after signing to Fueled By Ramen, they released their first full-length album, Take This to Your Grave, on May 6, 2003. The band received an advance from Island Records to record their proper debut, but the advance came with a right of first refusal for Island on Fall Out Boy's next album. With major financing in place, the recording of Take This to Your Grave took place at producer &amp; Garbage drummer Butch Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin, with Sean O'Keefe producing. With singles Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy and Saturday receiving video airplay on FUSE and mtvU and radio airplay on alternative stations across the country, the band soon gained a cult following. With very positive reviews at the South by Southwest Music Festival and an extensive tour schedule, Fall Out Boy's popularity continued to grow. The album sold very well and eventually achieved gold status, but only after the success of their next album, From Under The Cork Tree. In mid-2003 the band signed with Island Records, part of the super label The Island Def Jam Music Group along with Def Jam Records. This was after they picked up the option for their next album. While recording their mainstream debut, they released the acoustic EP My Heart Will Always Be the B-Side to My Tongue on Fueled by Ramen, May 18, 2004. It debuted at #153 on the Billboard Top 200, their first entry on the chart. The two-disc set included a DVD with videos, more acoustic performances and a fan photo gallery. 2005-2006: Commercial debut On May 3, 2005, Fall Out Boy released their major label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, which debuted on the Billboard 200 at #9, selling over 68,000 copies in its first week. The album achieved double platinum status and has sold over 2. 5 million albums in the US alone. Earlier that year, the band's stability was threatened when Wentz overdosed on the sedative Ativan in a failed suicide attempt. The track 7 Minutes In Heaven (Atavan Halen) from their album From Under the Cork Tree is based upon Wentz's attempted suicide. Their first single, Sugar We're Goin' Down, peaked at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, #6 on the Pop 100 and #3 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video reached #1 on MTV's TRL, where it was retired on August 26, 2005. The video also won the MTV2 Award at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards, prompting a huge new interest and surge in sales. The band was also nominated for \"Best New Artist\" at the 2006 Grammy Awards. The second single off the album, Dance, Dance, became their second Top 10 Single when it peaked at #9 on the Hot 100. It also reached #6 on the Pop 100 and became the bands top charted hit when it reached #2 on the Modern Rock Charts. The video for the song premiered on TRL on October 11, 2005; it soon reached #1 and was later retired on January 17, 2006. The third single off the album, A Little Less Sixteen Candles, A Little More 'Touch Me', was much less popular than both prior singles but still managed to peak at #65 on the Hot 100 and hit #1 twice on TRL, retiring on June 6, 2006. The band headlined the Nintendo Fusion Tour in the fall of 2005, joining The Starting Line, Motion City Soundtrack, Boys Night Out, and Panic! At the Disco on a 31 city tour. Due to their increased success from their MTV Video Music Award, they headlined the Black Clouds and Underdogs Tour--an emo/pop punk event that featured The All-American Rejects, Hawthorne Heights, From First to Last. The tour also featured The Hush Sound for half of the tour and October Fall for half. They played to 53 dates in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 2007: Continuing prosperity Fall Out Boy's fourth album, titled Infinity On High, was released on February 6, 2007. The lead single, This Ain't A Scene, It's An Arms Race, debuted at the 2006 American Music Awards. The video debuted on MTV on Tuesday, December 19, 2006. In the album's opening week, Infinity on High reached number 1 on the Billboard 200, selling 260,000 copies. \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\" peaked at number 2 on the UK Singles Chart on February 4, 2007, making it their most successful song in the UK to date. The single also peaked on the U. S. Hot 100 at number 2 and the U. S. Pop 100 at number 1. The Carpal Tunnel Of Love (the second single released from the album) reached number 81 on the U. S. Hot 100 by way of digital sales alone. Thnks fr th Mmrs was released on April 9, 2007 and made it to #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at #12 on the UK Singles chart. Fall Out Boy headlined the Honda Civic Tour in 2007 along with +44, The Academy Is. . . , Paul Wall and Cobra Starship. The tour was originally scheduled to start April 18 and end on June 11. However, due to personal issues, the tour was postponed until May 11, where the first show was played in Denver, Colorado. The tour ended on July 2 in Anaheim, California in the United States and continue on in the United Kingdom. Showing their versatility, Fall Out Boy has collaborated with rappers Kanye West, Babyface, Jay-Z, and Timbaland and are currently touring with Paul Wall. Babyface produced and Jay Z is featured on Thriller. They also worked with Timbaland on his new album Timbaland Presents Shock Value, where they are featured on the track One and Only, for which Stump and Wentz both contributed in writing. Stump was also featured on two songs with Gym Class Heroes (also signed with Fueled By Ramen), including their #1 Single Cupid's Chokehold. He also was a guest vocalist on Motion City Soundtrack's single, Everything Is Alright as well as contributing to If You Could Remember. The band played the US portion of the Live Earth concerts on July 7, 2007 at New Jersey's Giants Stadium, along with AFI, Akon, Alicia Keys, Bon Jovi, Dave Matthews Band, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw, John Mayer, Kanye West, Kelly Clarkson, KT Tunstall, Ludacris, Melissa Etheridge, The Police, Rihanna, Roger Waters, and the reunited Smashing Pumpkins. The band toured the world almost constantly in 2007, with gigs throughout the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Europe and Asia. 2008-2009: On April 1, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their live album, **** Live in Phoenix. The album was recorded in Pheonix on June 22. It contained a studio recording of Micheal Jackson's Beat It with John Mayer as a guest on the guitar. On the 18th of March, 2008, Fall Out Boy claimed they would play a gig in Antarctica, to be in the Guinness Book of World Records as the only band to have played in each of the 7 continents within 9 months. However, because of weather conditions they were unable to do so, although they did break the record for most interviews on radio in a 24-hour period, setting the bar at 72. On December 16th, 2008, Fall Out Boy released their 5th studio album, Folie a Deux (literally meaning \" madness shared by two \"). The lead single for the album, I Don't Care was released September 8, 2008. Fall Out Boy star in 2008 comedy film, 'Sex Drive'. They make a cameo within the film, playing Fame &lt; Infamy from their album Infinity on High. They also play an acoustic performance of Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy. This is due to the friendship executive producer Seth Green has with the band. The song I Don't Care from their latest album was featured in the end credits. During the credits there is a clip of Ezekiel and Fall Out Boy arguing over the fact that the Amish fixed Fall Out Boy's tour bus and all that they got in return was \"a five song set\" alluding to some form of compensation, which serves as a running gag. On November 17, 2009, Believers Never Die - Greatest Hits was released, featuring two new songs titled Alpha Dog and From Now On We Are Enemies. Along with the news of the release of the CD we also got some not so great news, Fall Out Boy are currently on a break. &quot; We&#x27;re just taking a break and decompressing. We&#x27;re not putting terms on when we&#x27;re coming back. We&#x27;re going to come back when everybody&#x27;s excited about it and it&#x27;s fun. &quot; says Pete Wentz to J14 Magazine. 2010-2012: Hiatus In early 2010 the band entered a state of hiatus, with each member eventually going off to explore their own musical interests. Wentz formed DJ duo Black Cards with singer Bebe Rexha in July 2010, releasing an EP before Rexha quietly left the group in January 2012. Trohman and Hurley started the band The Damned Things with Scott Ian from Anthrax and members of Every Time I Die, releasing their debut album Ironiclast in December 2010. Stump recorded his debut solo album Soul Punk which was released on July 26, 2011. Despite gaining generally positive reviews, ticket sales were poor with many Fall Out Boy fans unwilling to follow him in his new musical direction. This negative feedback caused Stump to create his blog entry &quot;We Liked You Better Fat&quot; in which he honestly aired his feelings, causing Wentz to reach out to him and ultimately begin collborating again musically in February 2012. 2013-Current: Reunion During 2012, the band reformed and began attempts to reinvent their sound. Sessions were difficult, with early attempts a struggle to produce new material. On February 4, 2013 the band simultaneously announced their reunion, a new single My Songs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up) and the album Save Rock and Roll which was released the following month. This announcement was immediately followed by a show that night in Chicago, and another at Webster Hall in New York the next day. Since then the band have been playing headlining arenas, concerts and festivals in America, Europe and Asia. ", "Front 242": "&quot; Front 242 &quot; is a pioneering Belgian electronic body music group that came into prominence during the 1980s. For years to come they took the lead in electronic music composition. During their most active period ( they decided to quit EBM in 1993 with the albums &quot; 06:21:03:11 UP EVIL &quot; and &quot; 05:22:09:12 OFF &quot; ) they were influential to many electro-industrial and electronic artists. The origin of &quot;Front 242&quot; should be understood within the rise of industrial music, which originated in England in 1975 with the first performances of &quot; Cabaret Voltaire &quot; and &quot; Throbbing Gristle &quot;. These revolutionary groups introduced elements of style later taken up by &quot;Front 242&quot; such as electronic instrumentation, overwhelming percussion often with found objects, and looped samples of found soundbites. Going back earlier, these innovations can be seen as an extension of the work of William S. Burroughs and of Edgard Varese , the first significant composer to adopt electronic sources of sound as musical instruments, and who also used overwhelming percussion including with found objects. It is perhaps no coincidence that Varese&#x27;s great mark on the music world took place at the &quot;1958 World Fair&quot; in Brussels, where Front 242 would work a few decades later. Front 242 was created in 1981 in Aarschot, Belgium by Daniel Bressanutti and Dirk Bergen , who originally went by the name &quot; Prothese &quot;. They were interested in creating both music and graphic design using emerging electronic tools, and reportedly decided on changing their name to &quot;Front 242&quot; because the name had greater potential as a subject of graphic design. The first single to be released was &quot; Principles &quot;, late in that year. Patrick Codenys and Jean-Luc De Meyer had separately formed a group called &quot; Under Viewer &quot; at about the same time. Codenys said his father received a lottery winning and shared enough of it with him so that he could buy a car, but he bought his first synthesizer instead. Contact between Bressanutti and Codenys led the two duos to join together in 1982. Bressanutti, Codenys and De Meyer all took turns on vocals at first, until they settled on De Meyer as the lead vocalist; only recently have early recordings with Bressanutti on vocals been widely released. De Meyer also came to write almost all of the lyrics. They also decided during this formative period never to use the regular waveform settings on their synthesizers, saying instead that creating the waveform itself for each note was part of the creative process. Their next single, &quot; U-Men &quot;, would be released in 1982, followed by the band&#x27;s first album &quot; Geography &quot; in 1983. These first releases, while cited as influential by a number of other artists in the genre, were not as characteristically strong and hard-hitting as the group&#x27;s later efforts. In 1983, Dirk Bergen left the band to pursue graphic design full time, and Richard Jonckheere was admitted to the group as a loosely backing vocalist and charismatic stage presence. Jonkheere was usually referred to by the name Richard 23 . &quot;Front 242&quot; was becoming the most popular musical group in Belgium; their next album, &quot; No Comment &quot; would cement the group&#x27;s place in electronic music, and was the first to introduce the term &quot;Electronic Body Music&quot; in association with their sound. &quot;Front 242&quot; signed with the legendary Wax Trax label in 1984, and started their first tour in the United States with &quot; Ministry &quot;. This tour led to the creation of &quot; Revolting Cocks &quot; by Richard 23 , Luc Van Acker , Alain Jourgensen of &quot;Ministry&quot; and others. The 1985 album &quot; Back Catalogue &quot; collected material from the group&#x27;s earlier years, but their international breakthrough didn&#x27;t occur until the release of &quot; Official Version &quot; in 1986, on the Red Rhino Europe label, followed by their &quot;Official Warfare&quot; tour in support of the album. Their popularity would reach even higher with the 1988 &quot; Headhunter &quot; single and video by Anton Corbijn, and its accompanying album &quot; Front By Front &quot;. By this point, &quot;Front 242&quot; had developed a style of strong backbeats, slices, samples, and ominous vocals. &quot;Headhunter&quot; is possibly one of the most popularly played and remixed songs of the entire genre. During these releases &quot;Front 242&quot; also presented a style and imagery which was political in a decidedly apolitical style. They would use militaristic samples, preachers and the TV as a source for inspiration, but refused to admit to having any message. The message, admittedly, was the listener&#x27;s to imagine. As they put it, they were merely presenting the world around them as it was. Possibly due to this rather in-your-face approach, they have often been falsely accused of being neo-Nazis or extreme right-wing. In fact the complete opposite is true, with them famously saying that &quot;Neo-Nazis couldn&#x27;t make the music we do. They&#x27;re too stupid!&quot; With the turn of the decade the band went through many changes. &quot; Tyranny &gt;For You&lt; &quot;, released in 1991, brought the world a much denser, multi-layered sound which would push them straight into the 1990s. This album, like &quot; Front by Front &quot; was a huge success and it seemed as if the Frontmen could just go from strength to strength. &quot;Tyranny&quot; was also the first album they released in North America under contract with a major corporate label, Sony/Epic. After the widespread popularity of &quot;Front by Front&quot;, Sony/ Epic also issued re-released versions of Front 242&#x27;s five earlier albums, with several E. P. &#x27;s and singles consolidated as extra tracks on the albums. 1992 saw Bressanutti return his focus on combining graphic arts with music, with a tour of his lithographs to three U. S. galleries. Bressanutti also composed a solo half-hour atmospheric recording called Art and Strategy (or The Art Corporation) to play during viewings of the lithographs, and released this in a limited edition of 1,000 CDs. This is the only known solo work from any of Front 242&#x27;s members. Front 242&#x27;s style shifted abruptly with each of their next two albums, released in rapid succession in 1993 ( originally planned as a double-CD ). &quot; 06:21:03:11 UP EVIL &quot; and &quot; 05:22:09:12 OFF &quot; were brilliant releases musically and once again showed that &quot;Front 242&quot; did not need to follow existing trends to stay fresh and original, even using a female vocalist ( the numbers correspond to letters, spelling &quot;FUCK UP EVIL&quot; and &quot;EVIL OFF&quot; ). However at this point there were strains emerging, with the band members apparently having different artistic views about how to progress. Neither of these albums had significant input from Richard 23, and &quot;05:22:09:12 OFF&quot; only intermittently included their lead vocalist, Jean-Luc De Meyer. On the other hand, a variety of new contributors were listed as members of &quot;Front 242&quot; on these albums: Jean-Marc Pauly and Pierre Pauly on &quot;Up Evil&quot;, and 99 Kowalski and Eran Westwood on &quot;Off&quot; ( &quot;99 Kowalski&quot; is the assumed name of Kristin Kowalski , making a tradition out of Richard 23&#x27;s idea of number-as-name ). Kowalski, Westwood, and percussionist John Dubs were members of a short-lived New York City based band called &quot; Spill &quot; who were temporarily integrated into &quot;Front 242&quot; after their recording sessions as the former band fell apart . A broader segment of the non-industrial-music-loving public was exposed to &quot;Front 242&quot; in 1992 in the film &quot;Single White Female&quot; starring Bridget Fonda and Jennifer Jason Leigh, when evil roommate Leigh ties up good roommate Fonda to a chair, and then turns the volume way up on the T. V. to drown out the sound of Fonda calling for help; the T. V. is playing the &quot;Front 242&quot; video for &quot; Rhythm Of Time &quot; from the album &quot;Tyranny &gt;For You&lt;. &quot; Also in 1992, the T. V. commercials for the film &quot;K2&quot; were set to the Front 242 song &quot; Moldavia &quot;, from the album &quot;Tyranny &gt;For You&lt;,&quot; although there was no &quot;Front 242&quot; in the film itself. To the disappointment of many, the years following &quot;06:21:03:11 Up Evil&quot; and &quot;05:22:09:12 Off&quot; would be bereft of new material from &quot;Front 242&quot; under any lineup, filled instead with a stream of live recordings and remixes. However, this period also saw a proliferation of side projects, an inordinate number of which involved De Meyer. Earlier, Richard 23 had a side project as a member of Revolting Cocks, and De Meyer had a side project doing vocals for &quot; Bigod 20 &quot; for their debut single, &quot; The Bog &quot; in 1990. In 1995, De Meyer met Marc Heal of &quot; Cubanate &quot; at a &quot; Front Line Assembly &quot; concert, and the two of them collaborated along with Ged Denton and Jonathan Sharp , to record as &quot; Cyber-Tec Project &quot; for the new ( and short-lived ) Cyber-Tec record label. After the departure of Sharp and the demise of the Cyber-Tec label, the remaining group continued working under the name &quot; C-Tec &quot;. De Meyer also took over as vocalist for &quot; Birmingham 6 &quot; for their 1996 album &quot; Error of Judgment &quot;. 1996 also saw the debut album &quot; Elemental &quot; from &quot; Cobalt 60 &quot;, which De Meyer formed with the members of &quot; Kriegbereit &quot;, i. e. Dominique Lallement and Frederic Sebastien of Reims, France. This was the start of a number of releases from Cobalt 60. Meanwhile, Richard 23 recorded with the groups &quot; Holy Gang &quot; and later &quot; LeTschak &quot;. The four core members of &quot;Front 242&quot; regrouped in 1998 to compose radically reworked versions of many of their songs, which they then performed on their first tour in five years, appropriately called the &quot;RE:BOOT tour&quot;. They acknowledged the influence of &quot; The Prodigy &quot; and their &quot; Fat of the Land &quot; album in crafting the new, more techno style of &quot; RE:BOOT LIVE &quot;. The new tour material was the subject of Front 242&#x27;s new recording contract in the U. S. with Metropolis Records. &quot;Front 242&quot; also indicated at this time that they were recording new material. However, they once again seemed to become only minimally active after 1998, making occasional appearances in Europe and Mexico, while Codenys recorded under the name &quot; Gaiden &quot; with Steve Stoll in 2001. Then 2002 saw the beginning of a wave of new material from Bressanutti and Codenys, and then of &quot;Front 242&quot; itself. This began in August 2002 with the release of a DVD/CD two-disc set called &quot;Speed Tribe,&quot; released by Dance. com. The DVD was a collaboration with experimental documentary filmmakers Rod Chong and Sharon Matarazzo filming the 2001 24 Hour Le Mans, in which the race cars, clouds, rain and spectators are all used as impressionist elements of a visual backdrop for the music. Within three months of &quot;Speed Tribe&quot; was the first release from &quot; Male or Female &quot;, a. k. a. &quot; Morf &quot;, a new guise for Bressanutti and Codenys along with vocalist Elko Blijweert . In 2002 and 2003, &quot;Morf&quot; released an album, an E. P. , a double album, and a DVD/CD two-disc combo, on the Belgian record label Alfa Matrix, and went on tour through the U. S. Then, 2002 and 2003 also saw the release of the long-awaited first new material from &quot;Front 242&quot; proper in a decade: the E. P. &quot; Still and Raw &quot; and the album &quot; Pulse &quot;, released on XIII Bis Records in Europe and Metropolis Records in the U. S. These represented another iteration of Front 242&#x27;s explicitly stated goal of reinventing itself on almost every new album, as it has done through its history. The style of the two new releases tends to be a little more mellow than some of their past work, and makes revelatory use of glitchy and bleepy notes, while it also introduces a whole new level of manipulating De Meyer&#x27;s vocals to achieve novel effects of the human voice as musical instrument. The new releases also feature a much more emotional style from De Meyer than his previous &quot;Front 242&quot; work, but which was presaged in his later recordings with &quot;C-Tec&quot; and particularly &quot;Cobalt 60&quot; on its album &quot; Twelve &quot;. &quot;Front 242&quot; also promised a new U. S. tour showcasing the new material from &quot;Still and Raw&quot; and &quot;Pulse,&quot; originally indicating that it would take place in autumn 2004, though that has been pushed back. They have made occasional appearances in Latin America and Europe, even being rejoined by Dirk Bergen for a reunion concert in Aarschot in 2004 under the original lineup of Bressanutti, Bergen, Codenys and De Meyer ( kept secret until two days before the show ). They have also recently issued another re-release of their first album &quot;Geography&quot; on Alfa-Matrix, this time newly remastered personally by Bressanutti to surprisingly powerful effect, and with extra tracks and a second disc filled with very early material that had never before been released. Meanwhile their enthusiasm for side projects has continued, as Patrick Codenys started appearing with a new group called &quot; Red Sniper &quot;, Bressanutti started recording with a new group called &quot; Troissoeur &quot;, Codenys and Richard 23 formed a quasi-DJ project called &quot; Coder23 &quot; which is touring in late 2004 and early 2005 as the opening act for &quot; VNV Nation &quot;, and De Meyer collaborated as a vocalist with &quot; Glis &quot; in 2005. &quot;Front 242&quot; toured through twenty venues in North America in November 2005, their first tour as the full band since 2000. On June 4 2008, Alfa Matrix announced the imminent release of &quot; Moments&#8230; 1 &quot;, a &#x27;Live&#x27; recording encompassing the very best of Front 242&#x27;s compositions. The release is presented as a 2CD boxset and as 1CD which holds 4 tracks in alternative versions not featured on the 2CD box edition. And as a bonus with the limited 2CD boxset, Alfa Matrix will also include the free 18-track CD compilation &quot; Sounds from the Matrix 007 &quot; with unreleased songs.

They are frequently cited as one of the most influential and commercially successful groups of all time, recognized for their complex vocal harmonies, studio innovations, and musical impact that is still felt today. After rising to stardom with a string of hits that defined the &#x27;60s California Sound, they quickly delved into melancholy experimental pop, recording unorthodox arrangements with classical instruments. Following their most esteemed work, Pet Sounds (1966), they continued to explore styles such as minimalist rock and synthpop. With the release of 1974&#x27;s Endless Summer they became a more popular touring act, playing their greatest hits. They have recorded 36 Billboard Top 40 hits (including four number-one singles), have had over 100 million sales, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988. Formed in Hawthorne, California in 1961, the original group comprised singer-musician-composer Brian Wilson, his brothers Carl Wilson and Dennis Wilson, their cousin Mike Love, and friends Al Jardine and David Marks. South African musicians Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar played and sang with the band on three key albums during the early 1970s. Many changes in both musical style and personnel have occurred in their sometimes-stormy career: Brian Wilson&#x27;s mental illness, drug addiction and eventual withdrawal from the group; the deaths of Dennis Wilson in 1983 and Carl Wilson in 1998; and continuing legal battles among surviving members of the group. In December 2011, five of the group&#x27;s surviving members - Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce and David (But not Blondie or Ricky) - reformed in celebration of their 50th anniversary, announcing a new album and a 50-date international tour for 2012. The reunion ended immediately after the tour. Early Years The group was formed in 1961 in Hawthorne, California under the leadership of Brian Wilson, and included his brothers Carl and Dennis, their cousin Mike Love and school friend Al Jardine. The early inspirations of the group were the Wilsons&#x27; musician father, Murry, and the close vocal harmonies of groups such as The Four Freshmen. The group performed initially as The Pendletones, after the Pendleton woolen shirts popular then. Although surfing motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the sole actual surfer in the group. He suggested to his brothers that they do some songs celebrating his hobby and the lifestyle which had developed around it in Southern California. At first Murry Wilson, by many accounts a hard-driving man, steered The Beach Boys&#x27; career, engineering their signing with Capitol Records in 1962. In 1964 Brian Wilson fired his father after a violent confrontation in the studio. Over the next few years they became increasingly estranged; when Murry died some years later, Brian and Dennis did not attend the funeral. The Beach Boys&#x27; early material focused on the California youth lifestyle (e. g. , &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;), cars (&quot;Little Deuce Coupe&quot;) and of course surfing (&quot;Surfin&#x27; U. S. A. &quot;, &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; and many others). Although their music was bright and accessible, these early works contained remarkably sophisticated musical ideas. During this period, Brian Wilson rapidly progressed to become a melodist, arranger, and producer of world-renowned stature. Their early hits made them major pop stars in America and other countries, although their status as America&#x27;s top pop group was challenged in 1964 by the emergence of The Beatles, who became The Beach Boys&#x27; major creative rival. Like The Beatles, the Beach Boys showed very fast development during the mid-&#x27;60s, drawing upon the innovations of songwriters and producers such as Burt Bacharach and especially Phil Spector. They produced the enduring classic &quot;California Girls&quot; in 1965, a banner year for popular music which also saw similarly advanced singles by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Byrds, and James Brown. But it was the Beach Boys&#x27; role to create a myth of American freedom and dreams of adolescence, and increasingly, to articulate a dread of what lay after adolescence. Brian&#x27;s innovations and personal difficulties During 1964, Brian Wilson began to suffer from anxiety attacks, and withdrew from touring to concentrate on song writing and record production. Glen Campbell served as Wilson&#x27;s replacement on tours, until his own career success required him to leave the group. Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston subsequently became a full-time member of the band, first replacing Wilson on the road, and then contributing his talents in the studio. Wilson&#x27;s growing mastery of the recording studio and his increasingly sophisticated songs and complex arrangements reached an early peak with the acclaimed LP Pet Sounds (1966). Classic singles from that album, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; and &quot;God Only Knows&quot; showed Wilson&#x27;s growing skill as a composer, arranger and producer. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; is said to have been the first pop single ever released in the U. S. to have the word &quot;God&quot; in the title (because of which many radio stations in the U. S. refused to play it. ) &quot;Caroline, No&quot; also taken from Pet Sounds , was issued as a Brian Wilson solo single, the only time Brian was credited as a solo artist during the early Capitol years. The album&#x27;s meticulously layered harmonies and inventive instrumentation (performed by the cream of Los Angeles session musicians known as The Wrecking Crew) set a new standard for popular music. It remains one of the more evocative releases of the decade, with a distinctive strain of melancholy and nostalgia for youth. The album is still widely regarded as a classic and Paul McCartney has named it one of his favorite albums of all time, (with &quot;God Only Knows&quot; as his favorite song) often saying that it was a major influence on The Beatles&#x27; album, Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band . Despite the critical praise it received, the album was poorly promoted by Capitol Records and failed to become the major hit Brian had hoped it would be (only reaching #10). Its failure to gain wide recognition hurt him deeply. Because of his withdrawal from touring, Wilson was able to complete almost all the backing for the album while the Beach Boys were on tour in Japan. They returned to find a substantially complete album, requiring only their vocals to finish it off. There was some resistance from within the band to this new direction. Lead singer Mike Love is reported to have been strongly opposed to it, partly because he feared the band would lose its audience if they changed their successful formula, and partly because he personally disliked the new material, which he famously criticized as &quot;Brian&#x27;s ego music. &quot; At Love&#x27;s insistence, Brian changed the title of one song from &quot;Hang on to Your Ego&quot; to &quot;I Know There&#x27;s an Answer&quot;. Another likely factor in Love&#x27;s antipathy to Pet Sounds was that Wilson worked extensively on it with outside lyricist Tony Asher rather than with Love, even though Love had co-written the lyrics for many of their earlier songs and was the lead vocalist on most of their early hits. It should also be stated that Love, as recently as February 2008 in a top British music magazine, denies emphatically that he was opposed to Brian&#x27;s new directions. Quite the contrary, contributing the lyrics to the classic form of &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; which certainly seemed to usher in flower power. He really is tired of this view of him as being Brian&#x27;s nemesis. He could see Brian was destroying himself and that was what he feared. Seeking to expand on the advances made on Pet Sounds , Wilson began an even more ambitious project, originally dubbed Dumb Angel. Its first fruit was &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; which Brian described as &quot;a pocket symphony&quot;. The song became the Beach Boys&#x27; biggest hit to date, and a US and UK # 1 single in 1966 -- many critics consider it to be one of the best rock singles of all time. In 1997 it was named the &quot;Greatest Single of All Time&quot; by Mojo music magazine, in 2000, VH1 placed it at number 8 on their &quot;100 Greatest Rock Songs&quot; list, and in late 2004 Rolling Stone magazine placed it at number 6 on their &quot;500 Best Songs of All Time&quot; list. It was also one of the more complex pop productions ever undertaken, and was reputed to have been the most expensive American single ever recorded, costing a reported $16,000 &ndash; more than most pop albums of that time &ndash; with sessions stretching over several months in at least three major studios. In contrast to his work on Pet Sounds , Wilson adopted a modular approach to &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; -- he broke the song into sections and taped multiple versions of each at different studios to take advantage of the different sound of each facility. He then assembled his favorite sections into a master backing track and added vocals. The song&#x27;s innovative instrumentation included drums, organ, piano, tack piano, two basses, guitars, electro-theremin, harmonica, and cello. The group members recall the &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; vocal sessions as among the most demanding of their career. Even as his personal life deteriorated, Wilson&#x27;s musical output remained remarkable. The exact nature of his problems was a topic of much speculation. He abused drugs heavily, gained an enormous amount of weight, suffered long bouts of depression, and became paranoid. Several biographies have suggested that his father may have had bipolar disorder, and after years of suffering, Wilson&#x27;s own condition was eventually diagnosed as schizophrenia. The story behind &quot;Smile&quot; Shortly after completing &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; Wilson met session musician and songwriter Van Dyke Parks, and in late 1966 they began an intense collaboration that resulted in a suite of superb new songs for the Beach Boys&#x27; next album, which was originally going to be titled Dumb Angel but was renamed Smile . Using the same methods as on &quot;Good Vibrations,&quot; recording began in late 1966 and carried on into early 1967. Although the structure of the album and the exact running order of the songs have been subjects of endless speculation, it is apparent that Wilson and Parks intended Smile to be a continuous suite of songs that were linked both thematically and musically, with the main songs being linked together by small vocal pieces and instrumental segments that elaborated the musical themes of the major songs. But some of the other Beach Boys -- especially Love -- found the new music too difficult and too far removed from their established style; another serious concern was that the new music was simply not feasible for live performance by the current Beach Boys lineup. Love was bitterly opposed to Smile and was particularly critical of Parks&#x27; lyrics; he has also since stated that he was becoming deeply concerned about Wilson&#x27;s escalating drug intake. The problems came to a head during the recording of &quot;Cabinessence,&quot; when Love demanded that Parks explain the meaning of the closing refrain of the song, &quot;Over and over the crow cries uncover the cornfield. &quot; After a heated argument, Parks walked out and his partnership with Wilson came to an abrupt end. Many factors combined to focus intense pressure on Wilson as Smile neared completion, including mental instability, the pressure to perform against fierce opposition to his new music, the relatively poor response to Pet Sounds , Carl Wilson&#x27;s draft resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol. Matters were complicated by his reliance on both prescription and illegal drugs, particularly marijuana and amphetamines, which only exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Just weeks before The Beatles&#x27; Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band was released, Smile was shelved. Over the next 30 years the legends surrounding Smile grew, until it became the most famous unreleased album in the history of popular music. Some of the tracks were salvaged and rerecorded at Brian&#x27;s new home studio in drastically scaled-down versions. These were released, along with the completed versions of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; and &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, on the 1967 LP Smiley Smile , which would prove to be a critical and commercial disaster for the group. Despite the cancellation of Smile , interest in the work remained high and versions of several major tracks -- including &quot;Our Prayer&quot;, &quot;Cabinessence&quot;, &quot;Cool, Cool Water&quot;, and &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; -- were assembled by Carl Wilson over the next few years and included on later albums. The band was expecting to complete and release Smile even until 1972, when it became clear that only Brian would ever be able to make sense out of the endless fragments that were recorded. A substantial number of original tracks and linking fragments were included on the group&#x27;s 30th anniversary CD boxed set in 1993. Smile itself, in its original conception, did not surface until Wilson and Parks completed the writing and Brian rerecorded it as a solo project in 2004. Mid-career brings changes Following their peak popularity with the song &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was a period of declining commercial success, with Smiley Smile and subsequent albums doing poorly on the US charts (although they fared better in the UK). Their image problems were not helped by the criticism that followed their withdrawal from the bill of the 1967 Monterey International Pop Festival as a result of Carl&#x27;s draft problems, an event that would undoubtedly have been crucial in establishing their new sound had they been able to present their new material there. The 1967 album Wild Honey , regarded by many critics as a classic, features exuberant upbeat songs written by Brian and Mike, including the hit &quot;Darlin&#x27;&quot;, and a cover of Stevie Wonder&#x27;s &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot;. Friends (1968) is a quiet, tuneful, and largely acoustic album, influenced by the group&#x27;s adoption of the practice of transcendental meditation. The title single, however, backed by Dennis&#x27; songwriting debut Little Bird, was their least successful since 1962. This was followed by the single &quot;Do It Again&quot;, a return to their earlier &quot;fun in the sun&quot; style, which was moderately successful in the US, but went to #1 in the UK. As Brian&#x27;s health deteriorated in the late 1960s and early 1970s, his song output diminished and he became increasingly withdrawn from the group. To fill the void, the other members of the group began writing songs, and Carl gradually took over leadership of the band, developing into an accomplished producer. To complete their contract with Capitol Records before signing with Reprise, they produced one more album, 20/20 (1969), primarily a collection of leftovers (including some from Smile ), cover songs, and several new songs by Dennis. One of Denny&#x27;s songs, &quot;Never Learn Not To Love&quot;, featured lyrics by Charles Manson originally titled &quot;Cease to Exist&quot;. Besides &quot;Do It Again&quot;, the album included their cover of The Ronettes&#x27; &quot;I Can Hear Music&quot;, their last top 40 hit for seven years. Their first two Reprise LPs were Sunflower (1970) and 1971&#x27;s Surf&#x27;s Up , featuring new songs by Brian and all the group members, plus selections from the aborted Smile project. According to the liner notes for the 2004 version of Smile , Reprise expected the legendary album to be completed and released as part of the new contract, but this was never to be; however, these albums included some of their most evolved and complex music since the Smile period. The addition of Ricky Fataar and Blondie Chaplin in 1972 led to a dramatic departure in sound for the band. Carl and The Passions - So Tough was an uncharacteristic mix including several songs unrecognizable as the Beach Boys. Although it includes the classic &quot;Marcella&quot;, many consider the album among their poorest efforts. Continuing with Fataar and Chaplin , Holland (1973) was more successful. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Sail on Sailor,&quot; a brief return to the collaboration between Brian Wilson and Van Dyke Parks, was one of the more emblematic of Beach Boys songs. Although it did not produce any top-40 hits, Holland was popular on free-form FM-radio, and includes several classics including Al Jardine&#x27;s &quot;California Saga/California&quot;. In the summer of 1974 Capitol, in consultation with Love, released a double album compilation of the Beach Boys&#x27; pre- Pet Sounds hits, entitled Endless Summer . Helped by a sunny, colorful graphic cover, it caught the mood of the country and surged to #1 on the Billboard album chart, becoming their first gold record since &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and stayed on the album chart for three years. The following year another compilation, Spirit of America , also did well. These sales performances demonstrated that the classic Beach Boys sound was back in fashion. In 1975, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful joint concert tour with Chicago, with each group performing some of the other&#x27;s songs, including their previous year&#x27;s collaboration on Chicago&#x27;s hit &quot;Wishing You Were Here&quot;. Beach Boy voices were also heard on Elton John&#x27;s 1974 hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot;, but following Holland , the group produced no new music until 1976. Brian&#x27;s return 15 Big Ones marked the return of Brian Wilson as a major force in the group. This album includes several new songs composed by Brian, and several of his arrangements of favorite old songs by other artists, including &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (which made #5), &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;, and &quot;In The Still of The Night&quot;. Brian and Mike&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s OK&quot; was a return to their earlier &quot;fun-in-the-sun&quot; style, and was a moderate hit. In 1977 the Beach Boys released the LP Love You, a collection of 14 songs mostly written by Brian alone, including more &quot;fun&quot; songs (&quot;Honkin&#x27; Down The Highway&quot;), a mature love song (&quot;Let&#x27;s Put Our Hearts Together&quot;) - a quirky mix ranging from infectious to touching to downright silly. Although not a commercial success, the album has since gained the status of a classic within the Beach Boys&#x27; oeuvre. Brian&#x27;s contributions diminished over the next several albums until he again virtually withdrew from the group. Although he appeared sporadically with them in concert, he contributed little to their performances or recordings. Despite a much-publicised &quot;Brian&#x27;s Back&quot; campaign in the late &#x27;70s, most critics believed the group was past their prime. Many expected that Brian would one day become the latest in a long line of celebrity drug casualties. Deaths of Dennis and Carl Wilson In the late 70s Dennis Wilson also began to suffer increasingly from drug and alcohol abuse, and some of the group&#x27;s concert appearances were marred when he and other band members showed up onstage drunk or drugged. The band was forced to publicly apologize after a shambolic performance in Sydney in 1979 during which several members of the group appeared to be drunk. In spite of his own frequent drinking, Dennis Wilson managed to release his first solo work, Pacific Ocean Blue, and to launch the now famed work-in-progress Bambu, with friend and musician Carli Munoz. In 1980, the Beach Boys played a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D. C. before a vast crowd. This tradition continued for the next two years, but in 1983 Secretary of the Interior James Watt banned the group from playing on the Mall, saying that rock concerts drew &quot;an undesirable element&quot;. This drew howls of outrage from the many of the Beach Boys&#x27; American fans, who stated that the Beach Boys sound was a very desirable part of the American cultural fabric. First Lady Nancy Reagan apologized, and in 1985 the group appeared on the Mall again. The group most recently appeared on the Mall in 2005 for the Fourth of July concert. Dennis Wilson&#x27;s problems had escalated in the early 1980s, and he accidentally drowned in late 1983 while diving from his boat as he drunkenly tried to recover items he had previously thrown overboard. Despite Dennis&#x27;s death, The Beach Boys soldiered on, and they enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as the David Lee Roth version of &quot;California Girls&quot;. In 1987, they played with the rap group The Fat Boys, covering the song &quot;Wipe Out&quot; and filming a video for it. They scored their first #1 in 22 years with the 1988 song &quot;Kokomo,&quot; which was featured on the soundtrack of the hit Tom Cruise movie Cocktail and which became their biggest-selling hit ever. In 1996 they guested with Status Quo on a re-recording of Fun, Fun, Fun, which was a British Top 30 hit. Members of the band appeared on sitcoms such as Full House (starring sometimes drummer John Stamos) and Home Improvement in the 1990s, as well as touring occasionally, but their declining career contrasted dramatically with the massive public interest and rabid critical praise that followed Brian&#x27;s gradual return to touring in the 1990s. The critically acclaimed documentary I Just Wasn&#x27;t Made For These Times, important in restoring Wilson&#x27;s reputation, saw him performing for the first time with his now adult daughters, Wendy and Carnie, and included glowing tributes to his talents from a host of major music stars of the &#x27;60s, &#x27;70s, and &#x27;80s. Tragedy struck the Wilson family again in 1998 when Carl Wilson died of lung cancer. In 1997, while Carl was in the hospital fighting his cancer, David Marks rejoined the group, subbing for Carl. After Carl&#x27;s death, Al Jardine was forced out of the group due to a conflict with Love. Brian Wilson was pursuing a solo career at the time, and had no desire to work with the Beach Boys. Permission was given to Mike Love to tour under the Beach Boys&#x27; name, and from 1998 to 2011, &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; consisted of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston. Marks toured with them from Carl&#x27;s death until the summer of 1999, when he left the group due to health reasons. Their tours remained popular, even as they came to be viewed primarily as a nostalgia act. Meanwhile, Brian Wilson and Al Jardine each separately pursued solo careers with their new bands. Personnel changes through the years From the start, The Beach Boys have undergone many variations in composition, being represented by fill-ins as often as not. Wilson neighbor David Marks appeared on their first four albums and was a member from 1962 to 1963 as a temporary replacement for Jardine, who had left the group to pursue a career in dentistry. Marks rejoined the band in 1997, during Carl Wilson&#x27;s last illness, and remained with them for two years. Glen Campbell toured for several months with the group in 1965, as a touring replacement for Brian, who had played bass in concert. Campbell was subsequently replaced by Bruce Johnston, who later became a permanent member. During the mid-1970s drummer Ricky Fataar and guitarist Blondie Chaplin joined the band. Though not official members, The Beach Boys&#x27; supporting band has featured many notable musicians over the years. Keyboard player Daryl Dragon, later famous as half of the pop duo Captain &amp; Tennille, toured with the band, along with his future wife Toni Tennille. Carli Munoz, who had been playing percussion with the band since 1970, in 1971 replaced Daryl Dragon as keyboard player until 1981. Jeff Foskett joined the touring band in 1981 as a guitarist and vocalist and remained with the group until 1990, Foskett is currently a member of Brian Wilson&#x27;s group. Billy Hinsche, of Dino, Desi, &amp; Billy fame, was also a longtime member of the supporting band throughout the &#x27;70s, &#x27;80s, and &#x27;90s. Daryl Dragon&#x27;s brother Dennis Dragon was a percussionist for the group in the early &#x27;70s. Bobby Figueroa was a drummer and percussionist for the Beach Boys in the 1970s and 80s. Mike Meros was a longtime keyboard player for the group, leaving in 2001 to join Alan Jardine&#x27;s Endless Summer Band (Meros passed away in late 2007). Mike Kowalski was a longtime drummer for the band, starting his Beach Boys tenure in 1969, and continuing with the group throughout the &#x27;70s, &#x27;80s,&#x27; 90s, and &#x27;00s, only to leave in 2007. Ed Carter played guitar and bass for the group from 1969 through the late 1990s. Carter joined Al Jardine&#x27;s Beach Boys Friends and Family in 1999. Some of the changes in The Beach Boys&#x27; organization were less formal. They enjoyed a casual collaboration with fellow Southern Californians Jan and Dean. Much to the consternation of other band members, Wilson composed &quot;Surf City&quot; and gave the song, without compensation, to Dean Torrence. Jan and Dean, at the time not nearly as popular as The Beach Boys, recorded the song and scored their first number one single, long before the Beach Boys reached the same milestone. Years later, Torrence happened upon the studio where the Beach Boys were recording their &quot;Beach Boys&#x27; Party!&quot; album. He joined in the singing, and can be heard singing harmony in the &quot;Barbara Ann&quot; cut from that album. After the death of Carl Wilson, Mike Love received permission from Brian Wilson, Al Jardine, and the estate of Carl Wilson to tour under the Beach Boys name. In 1998 and 1999, Mike Love, Bruce Johnston, and David Marks toured under this incarnation of the Beach Boys. In 1999, David Marks left so he could focus on fighting his Hepatitis C (He was fully cured in 2004. ). From 1999 to 2011, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston have played up to 100 shows a year, sometimes more, under the Beach Boys banner. Jardine toured for a while with the Beach Boys Family &amp; Friends (which for legal reasons quickly became Alan Jardine Family &amp; Friends Beach Band), featuring his sons Matt and Adam, Wilson&#x27;s daughters Carnie and Wendy, former Beach Boys sidemen Ed Carter , Bobby Figueroa, and Carl&#x27;s brother-in-law Billy Hinsche, among others. Jardine now tours as the Endless Summer Band which includes his two sons, Hinsche, and several other performers including members of the pop/rock band Tripsitter. 50th Anniversary In December 2011, surviving members Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Al Jardine, David Marks, and Bruce Johnston reunited for a new studio album and an extensive 70-plus date &quot;50th Anniversary Celebration&quot; world tour. They used musicians from both Brian Wilson&#x27;s solo band and Mike Love&#x27;s touring &quot;Beach Boys&quot; as sidemen. The reunited Beach Boys played to enthusiastic crowds all over the world. In 2012 Mike Love announced that he and Bruce Johnston had booked shows for their scaled down version of the Beach Boys. Wilson, Jardine, and Marks wanted to continue with the reunited line up, but for various reasons, Love did not. In 2013, Mike Love and Bruce Johnston are continuing to tour under the Beach Boys name. Brian Wilson has been in the studio, it is not known whether the sessions are for the Beach Boys, or for Brian solo material. Brian Wilson also plans to play two shows with Al Jardine and David Marks, one show in Ohio, and the other at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. A live album and/or DVD, and a career-spanning box set entitled &quot;Made In California&quot; was released in 2013.

The band rose to fame in the early 2000s as a leading group in garage rock / post-punk revival . The band consists of Julian Casablancas (lead vocals), Nick Valensi (lead guitar), Albert Hammond, Jr. (rhythm guitar), Nikolai Fraiture (bass guitar) and Fabrizio Moretti (drums and percussion). \t Upon the release of their debut album, Is This It, in 2001, the group was met with much critical acclaim, being hailed by some as the &quot;saviors of rock and roll. &quot; NME made Is This It their Album of the Year. Since then, the band has maintained a large fan base, notably in the UK, US and Australia. As of 2007, Is This It has sold over 3. 5 million copies worldwide. \t They released their second album Room on Fire in October 2003, to good reviews, but to less success commercially, although it still went gold. The album&#x27;s sound maintained the Strokes&#x27; familiar reference points, while also evoking groups such as The Cars, Bob Marley, and Blondie. In the process, they made the cover of Spin Magazine for the second time, with each member receiving his own cover. They also made the cover of Rolling Stone for the first time. Additional media coverage of the band came from the relationship between Moretti and actress Drew Barrymore, which ended in January 2007. \t In late September 2005, &quot;Juicebox&quot;, the first single from The Strokes then unreleased third album, was leaked online, forcing the single&#x27;s release date to be advanced. The single was then released as an exclusive on online download services. &quot;Juicebox&quot; became The Strokes&#x27; second UK Top 10 hit, as well as their second US Modern Rock Top 10 success. During November and December 2005 the Strokes did a promotional tour for the still unreleased album, which involved doing one-off shows in major cities around the world. Their third album, First Impressions of Earth, was released in January 2006 to mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, a first for the band. In Japan it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was &quot;like a scientific breakthrough&quot;. In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing &quot;Juicebox&quot; and &quot;You Only Live Once&quot;. \t The Strokes&#x27; frontman Julian Casablancas and guitarist Nick Valensi started writing new material for their band&#x27;s forthcoming new album in the latter stages of January 2009, which they were set to go in the studio to finalize in February of the same year. In February 2010, Julian Casablancas told NME that the band&#x27;s fourth album was set to be released in September 2010. The release date has been pushed back again, and the album, titled &quot;Angles&quot; will now be released March 22, 2011 in America. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Under Cover of Darkness&quot; was made available as a free download from the band&#x27;s website on February 9, 2011 for a 48 hour period. The Strokes&#x27; fifth album is called &quot;Comedown Machine&quot; and was released on March 26th 2013 In North America and March 25th in the U. K. The first single is called &quot;All the Time&quot;. \t Official website: http://www. thestrokes. com", "Kaiser Chiefs": "Kaiser Chiefs are a post-britpop band which formed in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England in early 2003. The band consists of Ricky Wilson (vocals), Andrew &quot;Whitey&quot; White (guitar), Simon Rix (bass), Nick &quot;Peanut&quot; Baines (keyboards) and Vijay Mistry(drums). Nick Hodgson is the band&#x27;s former drummer and main songwriter but left the band in December 2012 to focus on other projects. The band has released five albums as of 2014 and have released 16 singles, including the hits I Predict a Riot, Oh My God, Ruby and Never Miss a Beat. Several members of the band are ardent fans of the English football team Leeds United (as the band originates from Leeds). The band are named after the South African Kaizer Chiefs Football Club, the former team of long-serving former Leeds captain Lucas Radebe. The band&#x27;s main musical influences include The Beatles, The Beach Boys, The Kinks, Blur, Eric Burdon, The Jam, and other new wave bands. Andrew White (b. England; guitar), Ricky Wilson (b. Charles Richard Wilson, 17 January 1975, Keighley, West Yorkshire, England; vocals), Nick Baines (keyboards), Nick Hodgson (b. Nicholas Hodgson, 20 October 1977, England; drums) and Simon Rix (b. James Simon Rix, 18 October 1977, England; bass) formed the band in early 2003, having originally played garage rock under the Parva moniker. Their energetic brand of post-millennial guitar rock, which would have been branded &quot;indie&quot; in previous decades, quickly found favour on the local gig circuit. The quintet issued their debut, the XTC-soundalike Oh My God, before they had even signed a proper recording contract, teaming up with the Drowned In Sound website in May 2004 for a limited edition release. A contract with the B-Unique label followed and the band began to attract wider interest at the end of 2004 with the release of their storming I Predict A Riot. The topical lyrics, concerning alcohol-fuelled violence in small English towns, attracted as much attention as the band&#x27;s anarchic update on late 70s new wave. The band&#x27;s explosion onto the global music scene in early 2005 was epitomised when they had their first single I Predict A Riot off their debut album Employment played on the radio around the world and opened Live8 in Philadelphia. Several years prior to 2003 the members of the band had been a garage rock group called Parva (before that they had been known as Runston Parva). However, after their label Mantra Records went bust in late 2002, the band went back to their roots and adopted a more britpop sound, helping the band reach their current popularity within the UK and beyond as a consequence. The band re-released the single Oh My God on 21 February, which charted at #6. The debut album Employment was released on 7 March 2005 and entered the charts at #3 that week. Despite becoming favourite after being shortlisted, the album failed to win the 2005 Mercury Music Prize. They covered the Marvin Gaye classic, Heard it Through the Grapevine for the War Child album Help! A Day in the Life , giving a whole new slant on the song. A DVD, entitled Enjoyment, was released in November 2005. The basis of the DVD is a (semi-false) documentary about the band narrated by Bill Nighy. It also includes all the promo videos, live performances and more. An internet-only (so far) music video for their song Sink that Ship has been released in September 2005. The video appears on Electronic Arts&#x27; website as a promotional tool for their game Burnout Revenge but is completely unbranded. Wilson auctioned off his red tambourine to radio show Xfm in late 2005 to raise money for the homeless charity Shelter. The winning bid was PS375. 00. On February 5th, The Kaiser Chiefs Released their next single, Ruby, which was a major success reaching #1 in the singles charts. The Kaiser Chiefs released their new album, Yours Truly, Angry Mob on February 23, 2007 in The Netherlands and Belgium, February 26, 2007 in the United Kingdom and on March 27, 2007 in North America. A double disc edition is also available, the second disc being a DVD. It is known that three of the band members went to a school near Highroyd, Leeds. Also, Nick (drummer) announced during a gig in Newcastle Upon Tyne that his dad went to a school called St. Cuthberts in Newcastle. Other famous people from that school include Ant &amp; Dec and Sting. The band released their third album, Off With Their Heads, on October 20, 2008. It contains the hit single Never Miss a Beat. Songfacts states that the band&#x27;s fourth album, The Future Is Medieval was released through the band&#x27;s website on June 3, 2011.

Performances Kaiser Chiefs&#x27; first big festival show was at the dual-site Reading and Leeds Festival on 27 August 2004 and in the following year, on 16 May 2005, they appeared at the Pinkpop Festival in Landgraaf, The Netherlands. After that, things went fast. They were the opening act at the Philadelphia Live 8 concert on July 2nd 2005, one of only two British acts in the lineup (Def Leppard being the other). They performed I Predict a Riot, Everyday I Love You Less and Less and Oh My God. They played Reading and Leeds in 2006 before Franz Ferdinand and were extremely popular. June 2005 saw them headline at the May Ball at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, supported by Anada, before an acclaimed appearance at a rain-soaked Glastonbury festival during the same month, whilst August&#x27;s appearance at the V Festival featured a very enthusiastic set despite Ricky Wilson having his leg in plaster. Also more recently they embarked on their own headline UK Tour, supported by Maximo Park and The Cribs. Their first US tour (with The Cribs) ran through the summer of 2005, and they followed it by playing a few shows on the Foozer tour. This was followed up by opening for Foo Fighters during their Australian tour in December 2005. They also played to Jools Holland and his audience on December 31, 2005. Their song Ruby, from the album Yours Truly, Angry Mob was featured as a bonus song in Guitar Hero III, and I Predict a Riot from Employment was eventually released as downloadable content for the game. Kaiser Chiefs are set to return to the European festival scene this summer, having been booked for Switzerland&#x27;s Gurten Festival. ", "Kelly Rowland": "Kelendria Trene Rowland (born February 11, 1981) is an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter, dancer, actress, and five-time Grammy award winner who rose to fame as one of the founding members of the very successful R&amp;B girl group Destiny&#x27;s Child. After a series of commercially successful releases with the group and a worldwide number-one success with rapper Nelly and their Grammy-winning single &quot;Dilemma&quot;, Rowland released her debut solo album Simply Deep in 2002. The album became a commercial success, eventually selling more than 2. 5 million copies woldwide, and garnered three more or less successful singles. Rowland&#x27;s often-delayed second album, Ms. Kelly was released June 25, 2007 in Europe and July 3, 2007 in the United States. So far, the album has spawned the top 5 single &quot;Like This&quot;, a collaboration with rapper Eve, as well as the Snoop Dogg-collaboration &quot;Ghetto&quot; and the international single &quot;Work. &quot; With the upcoming 2008 re-release of Ms. Kelly, Rowland is set to release a new single entitled &quot;Daylight&quot; which features Gym Class Heroes. While maintaining a recording career Rowland has also gained fame for starring in several film and television productions, including a starring role in the 2004 romantic comedy The Seat Filler, a supporting role in the 2003 slasher film Freddy vs. Jason, and several guest appearances on TV series such as The Hughleys and Girlfriends. Kelly Rowland (born Kelendria Trene Rowland February 11, 1981 in Atlanta, Georgia) was one of the founding members of super group &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot; who went on to become the best selling female group of all time. In 2002, Kelly released her debut album &quot;Simply Deep&quot;. The album spawned 4 hit singles &quot;Stole&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Nobody&quot;, &quot;Train On A Track&quot;, and of course &quot;Dilemma&quot;. After both &quot;Dilemma&quot;, and &quot;Stole&quot; went on to become two of the best selling singles of 2002, Kelly was officially recognised as a very talented solo star. &quot;Simply Deep&quot; has gone on to sell more then 3 Million Copies Worldwide. Kelly has recently released her sophomore album &#x27;Ms. Kelly&#x27;, from which the hit singles Like This and Work are taken from. The album was released to limited critical success. Kelly Rowland has announced she will be doing a worldwide tour to support the album with dates yet to be confirmed. Rowland achieved her biggest hit in the UK in 2009 when she collaborated with David Guetta for the song When Love Takes Over. ", "Stars of the Lid": "Stars of the Lid are a band specializing in drone-based ambient music. They list among their influences minimalist and electronic composers such as Arvo Part, Zbigniew Preisner, Gavin Bryars, and Henryk Gorecki, as well as Talk Talk (both bands have tracks named &quot;Taphead&quot;), post-rock artists Labradford, and ambient innovator Brian Eno. Their music largely consists of beatless soundscapes, composed of droning, effects-treated guitars along with piano, strings, and horns; volume swells and feedback fill the gap of rhythmic instruments, providing dynamic movement within the songs. Formed in Austin, Texas in 1993, the band has two members -- Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie. Both have released solo material, the former under his own name and the latter under the The Dead Texan alias. Their 2001 album, a double-LP named The Tired Sounds Of Stars Of The Lid, was released to generally positive reviews. The follow up, Stars of the Lid and Their Refinement of the Decline, another double-disc album, was again released on Chicago&#x27;s revered Kranky Records--the label&#x27;s milestone 100th release--on April 2nd. ", "Solitaire Miles": "", "Propagandhi": "Propagandhi is a punk band formed in Portage La Prairie, Manitoba, Canada in 1986 by Chris Hannah and Jord Samolesky. While their earlier work draws from the punk and skate punk tradition, recent Propagandhi records have moved towards a heavier, hardcore thrash-influenced sound. The band members are known for championing various political causes. They have taken an active stance against human rights violations, racism, homophobia, imperialism, fascism, capitalism and organized religion. The band supports vegan lifestyles, animal rights campaigns and feminism, and have described themselves as &quot;Gay Positive&quot;. In 1986, Samolesky and Hannah recruited original bassist Scott Hopper via a &quot;Progressive Thrash Band, bassist wanted&quot; flyer they posted in a local record shop. Hopper was replaced around the turn of the decade by Mike Braumeister. This was the first lineup to perform live. After several demos and larger shows (including one with Fugazi) made a name for the band, Braumeister moved to Vancouver and a young musician with an inclination towards poetry named John K. Samson became the band&#x27;s third bassist. It was this lineup of Hannah, Samolesky and Samson that would go on to put out the band&#x27;s early albums and gain recognition outside of Canada. In 1992, Propagandhi played a show with NoFX. Impressed by their performance, Fat Mike signed them to his independent record label Fat Wreck Chords and asked them to come to L. A. to record their debut album. &#x27;How To Clean Everything&#x27; was released in 1993, musically, the album owed a lot to 90s skate punk, but there were still glimpses of the band&#x27;s &#x27;Progressive Thrash&#x27; roots in some of the riffs. The band spent the next three years touring and enjoying the popularity provided by the explosion of punk rock in the mid-1990s. In 1996, they recorded and released their second album, on Fat Wreck Chords - &quot;Less Talk, More Rock&quot;. The album title was a joke, as Propagandhi were (particularly at that point in their career) well known for going into lengthy rants during their live performances. The album was, if anything, more politically out-spoken than its predecessor, with song titles including; &quot;Apparently I&#x27;m a P. C. Fascist (Because I Care About Both Human and Non-Human Animals)&quot;, &quot;Nailing Descartes To The Wall / (Liquid) Meat Is Still Murder,&quot; and &quot;&#8230; And We Thought That Nation States Were a Bad Idea. &quot; However, for all this, the album did see Propagandhi begin to find a sound more their own than on their debut - musically and lyrically - as well as seeing John K. Samson move from bassist/backing vocalist to occasional singer/songwriter (Samson would go on to re-work a handful of his songs from this period with The Weakerthans). In 1997, John K. Samson decided to quit the band and form The Weakerthans. Chris and Jord co-founded the record label G7 Welcoming Committee Records (G7 would later release the first Weakerthans&#x27; album). The label&#x27;s co-operative economic structure is based upon that proposed in Robin Hahnel and Michael Albert&#x27;s &#x27;Parecon&#x27;, and was initially started thanks to a $50,000 loan from Fat Mike. During this time, Propagandhi released a collection of demos, alternate takes, covers and live songs called &#x27;Where Quantity Is Job #1. &#x27; A new bassist - Todd Kowalski of the bands I Spy and Swallowing Shit (who have also put out material on G7) - replaced Samson that year. After four years, Propagandhi released their third full-length album, &#x27;Today&#x27;s Empires, Tomorrow&#x27;s Ashes&#x27;. The album marked a major departure from their previous works; the song titles and lyrics of &#x27;Today&#x27;s Empires&#x27; furthered the sphere of their political views and presented their ideas in a more coherent and, arguably, more mature way. Bolstered by the addition of Todd&#x27;s aggressive song-writing (in contrast to Samson&#x27;s earlier influence) and an increased density of guitar lines, this album was also the band&#x27;s heaviest to date and had much more in common with hardcore thrash than with skate punk. The album included enhanced content, with videos and essays on topics such as COINTELPRO and the Black Panther Party, and US foreign policy. Propagandhi released their fourth studio LP on October 18, 2005. &#x27;Potemkin City Limits&#x27; saw the band&#x27;s songwriting style change again, with generally longer songs, alternating heavier/softer parts and more polished vocals and structured music. Strangely, given his influence on their previous release, Todd&#x27;s songwriting style in particular would embrace softer music and more cryptic lyrics. Like &#x27;Today&#x27;s Empires, Tomorrow&#x27;s Ashes&#x27;, the album has multimedia content, with a number of Adobe PDF files on topics such as Parecon and veganism. Chris Hannah adopted the pseudonym &quot;Glen Lambert&quot; for use during the release of Potemkin City Limits, causing confusion among some fans, reviewers, and commentators. In September 2005, G7 Welcoming Committee Records jokingly announced that Chris had left the band in 2003, and that the remaining members had found a replacement in Glen Lambert, formerly of the Portage Terriers. This claim was quickly revealed to be untrue through a multitude of sources. Without admitting to the joke, Propagandhi announced on August 14, 2006 that &quot;Glen Lambert&quot; had been dismissed and would be replaced by &quot;former&quot; member Chris Hannah. They also added guitarist David Guillas, making the band a four-piece for the first time. Guillas, nicknamed &quot;The Beaver&quot;, is a former member of two Winnipeg-based rock outfits, Giant Sons and Rough Music. In 2007 the band released a DVD entitled &#x27;Live from Occupied Territory&#x27;, which features a recording of their set at The Zoo in Winnipeg on July 19, 2003. Proceeds of the DVD benefit the Grassy Narrows blockade and the Middle East Children Alliance. Included on the DVD are two full-length documentaries: &#x27;Peace, Propaganda and the Promised Land&#x27;, and &#x27;As Long as the Rivers Flow&#x27;. On March 10, 2009 Propagandhi released &#x27;Supporting Caste&#x27;. In a press release, the band had this to say about their latest album: &quot;Propagandhi are proud pleased delighted required to announce the release of their new album, Supporting Caste. Recorded at the band's own Illegal Combatant Studios and the world-renowned Blasting Room in Ft. Collins Colorado, Supporting Caste is the fifth full length release from Winnipeg's Propagandhi. Crafted in collaboration with Bill Stevenson (Black Flag, Descendents, Zeke, 7 Seconds), this 12 song collection of boundless power and depth is a 50 000 watt forward-thinking tip-of-the-hat to the giants -- Voivod, Rush, SNFU, Sacrifice, Razor, Guilt Parade - that have gone before them. Legendary and unrepentant residents of humankind's ideological peanut-gallery, Propagandhi does not disappoint with Supporting Caste, launching crude rockets into the heart of the prevailing order with meditations that range in focus from the humane slaughter and consumption of non-vegans in an elaborate 18-course banquet (with wine pairings) to the apparent confusion of turning on the TV to watch a simple hockey game and having to wonder whether or not the Nazi's actually lost the war after all. Supporting Caste: 12 new laments, reveries and extrapolations from 4 visibly-aging prairie skids who still cannot believe that of all the gin joints in all the galaxies in all the universes, they had to be born on this one. &quot; Propagandhi are known for their slow-pace production, taking many years between one record and the next one, and their rare live shows, which take place in small venues and, generally, got the entrance fee fixed at an affordable price. ", "Radiohead": "Radiohead are an English alternative rock band from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK which formed in 1985. The band is composed of Thom Yorke (lead vocals, rhythm guitar, piano, beats), Jonny Greenwood (lead guitar, keyboard, other instruments), Ed O&#x27;Brien (guitar, backing vocals), Colin Greenwood (bass guitar) and Phil Selway (drums, percussion). The early years (1992 - 1995) Radiohead released their first single, &quot;Creep&quot; in 1992. The song was initially unsuccessful, but it became a worldwide hit several months after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Radiohead&#x27;s popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their second album, The Bends (1995). The band&#x27;s textured guitar parts and Yorke&#x27;s falsetto singing were warmly received by critics and fans. International success (1996 - 2000) Radiohead&#x27;s third album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to greater international fame. Featuring an expansive sound and themes of modern alienation, OK Computer has often been acclaimed as a landmark record of the 1990s. A change in style and leaving EMI (2000 - 2003) Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001) marked a change in the band&#x27;s musical style. Radiohead incorporated experimental electronic music, Krautrock, post-punk and jazz influences into their songs, dividing fans and critics, but they remained popular. Hail to the Thief (2003), a mix of guitar-driven rock, electronics and lyrics inspired by headlines, was the band&#x27;s final album for their major record label, EMI. Independent releases and touring (2005 - 2013) In 2007, Radiohead independently released their seventh album, In Rainbows, originally as a digital download for which each customer could set their own price, later in stores, to critical and chart success. In 2011, Radiohead released their eighth album, The King of Limbs - again independently - which was described as an exploration of rhythm and quieter textures. In February 2012, Radiohead began The King of Limbs world tour - with concerts in the US, Canada, Mexico, Europe, Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. In early 2013, following the tour, Thom Yorke released a studio album entitled Amok with his band Atoms for Peace. A new album on the horizon? (2015?) In late 2014, the band confirmed it was back in the recording studio, working on their ninth studio album. During an interview with Drowned in Sound in February 2015, drummer Phil Selway, said the new album was \"coming along nicely\" . In June 2015, guitarist, Jonny Greenwood, confirmed to a Dutch music website &quot;3voor12&quot; that the new album was progressing and they were working on a old track called &quot;Lift&quot;. In mid 2015, rumors circulated that Radiohead will record the new James Bond soundtrack for the movie &quot;Spectre&quot; due for release in Oct 2015. ", "Joy Division": "Joy Division were a post-punk band formed in 1976 in Salford, Greater Manchester, United Kingdom. Originally named Warsaw, the band consisted of Ian Curtis (vocals and occasional guitar), Bernard Sumner (guitar and keyboards), Peter Hook (bass guitar and backing vocals) and Stephen Morris (drums and percussion). The band dissolved in May 1980 after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis. Much of their popularity/reputation arguably resulted from frequent playings on air by iconic DJ John Peel, but it is easy now to overlook the impact that the first album, Unknown Pleasures, had on post-punk music at the time, as reference the number of prominent bands that cited this album as an influence. The remaining members reformed as New Order and they have gone on to achieve much critical and commercial success. With their dark, cavernous sound and their use of synthesizers and electronics, Joy Division are considered the pioneering band of the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and the early 1980s. Though they found only modest success during their career, and released only two studio albums, Joy Division have since been acclaimed as one of the most inventive, evocative and influential groups of their era; Thom Jurek writes &quot;They left just a small bit of music and an echo that still rings&quot;. 1976 Inspired by a Sex Pistols gig at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall on July 20, 1976, Bernard Sumner (also credited as &quot;Bernard Dicken&quot; and &quot;Bernard Albrecht&quot;) and Peter Hook formed a band with friend Terry Mason. Sumner bought a guitar, Hook purchased a bass, and Mason a drum kit. The band placed an advertisement in a Manchester record store and recruited Curtis as their singer. Curtis knew Sumner, Hook and Mason from previous gigs and was also in attendance at the Sex Pistols concert with his wife, Deborah. Richard Boon and Pete Shelley of Buzzcocks suggested the name &quot;Stiff Kittens&quot; for the band. Although &quot;Stiff Kittens&quot; appeared on some gig flyers, the band didn&#x27;t like the name and never officially accepted it. 1977 Lacking confidence in his abilities as a drummer, Mason quit the group the day before their first gig to become their manager. He was replaced by Tony Tabac. Just before their first gig on May 29, 1977, supporting Buzzcocks and Penetration at the Electric Circus, the band renamed themselves Warsaw; though they had already appeared on the bill as the Stiff Kittens. Five weeks and half a dozen gigs later, Tabac was replaced by punk drummer Steve Brotherdale from another band called Panik. They recorded The Warsaw Demo on July 18, 1977, consisting of five crude punk songs. After the demo, Brotherdale was fired. One member asked him to check on what he &quot;thought&quot; was a flat tyre. When he got out of the car, the other three drove off. Brotherdale tried to get Curtis to join Panik but was rebuffed. Stephen Morris who responded to an ad in a music store window, was hired as Brotherdale&#x27;s replacement. He was hired primarily because Curtis remembered him from his academic days as Morris attended the same school two years below Curtis. Unlike the previous drummers, Morris clicked well with the three. His metronome-like drumming owed more to krautrock than the aggressive bombast typical of many punk drummers. In late 1977, in order to avoid confusion with the London punk band Warsaw Pakt, Warsaw renamed themselves Joy Division. The name was in reference to groups of women used as sex slaves in Nazi German concentration camps depicted in Ka-Tzetnik 135633&#x27;s 1955 novel The House of Dolls. Although the choice of name was more reflective of a desire to challenge taboos, this choice along with Sumner&#x27;s adoption of the surname Albrecht garnered the band a lot of criticism for perceived insensitivity. They were even dogged by accusations of neo-Nazism, a charge they strenuously denied. The accusations resurfaced to a certain degree after Joy Division broke up and reformed as New Order, a name that could be interpreted as a reference to Hitler&#x27;s speeches promising &quot;the new order of the Third Reich. &quot; . The band&#x27;s music and style stabilized around this time. Sessions recorded in December 1977 sound considerably different from The Warsaw Demo . 1978 The group played their first gig as Joy Division on January 25, 1978. They played regularly in the north of England throughout early 1978, and then recorded enough material for a debut album. However, after the studio engineer added synthesizers to several tracks, the band scrapped it. The album would be released as a bootleg in 1982 and then officially 10 years later. Rob Gretton became the band&#x27;s manager in May 1978. Over the next 20 years, his addition would play an integral part in forming the Joy Division/New Order legacy. Joy Division&#x27;s debut on vinyl was on a compilation in the summer of 1978 called Short Circuit . Though listed as Joy Division, it was actually a track from the Warsaw days recorded live on October 2, 1977 The song, recorded live, was preceded by Sumner screaming &quot;You all forgot Rudolf Hess&quot;. In June 1978 their December 1977 sessions were released as a 7&quot; EP under the title An Ideal for Living. In late 1978, An Ideal for Living was remastered and re-released as a 12&quot;. On September 20, 1978, they performed on the TV show Granada Reports; then in December 1978, they appeared on the compilation EP A Factory Sample , contributing two tracks recorded a few months earlier. This EP sold out within a couple of months and was the first release to document the haunting and atmospheric sound that Joy Division had been developing since that past summer. Early 1979 saw Joy Division gain more publicity. Ian Curtis appeared on the front cover of the New Musical Express. Joy Division recorded a radio session in January (aired on BBC Radio 1 on February 14 by the respected DJ John Peel). On March 4, they supported The Cure at the Marquee Club, a major venue in London. In April 1979, the band began recording their landmark debut album Unknown Pleasures at Strawberry Studios in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The record was far bleaker and darker than most of its contemporaries, featuring Hook&#x27;s bass as the lead melodic instrument, drums soaked in icy reverb, Sumner&#x27;s jagged guitar and Curtis&#x27;s baritone vocal style. A large debt was owed to the genius of meticulous producer Martin Hannett. Whereas most punk rock bands had been extroverted and aggressive, Joy Division were more introverted and personal. Despite their insularity, however, their music could be very aggressive, chaotic and at times even violent. The album cover, designed by Peter Saville based on a graph of 100 consecutive pulses from the pulsar CP 1919, is regarded as a classic of minimalist sleeve design. The image was found by Sumner in a book of Astronomy and represents &quot;the final flashes of a dying star. &quot; Unknown Pleasures was released in June while Joy Division were recording five songs for Piccadilly Radio. They performed on Granada TV again in July, made their first and last nationwide TV appearance in September on BBC2, supported The Buzzcocks in a 24-venue UK tour during October and November, and performed again on Peel&#x27;s BBC radio show in December. Despite the fact that Unknown Pleasures was selling well and receiving good reviews from the music press, all was not well. Curtis, who suffered from epilepsy, would often have onstage tonic-clonic seizures that resulted in unconsciousness and convulsions, or absence seizures that would cause brief trance-like pauses. Even after disposing of their light show, Curtis would still have these problems; and the band decided to rest over the Christmas holiday. 1980 In January 1980, Joy Division set out on a European tour. Several dates were cancelled due to Curtis&#x27;s deteriorating health. On February 28th, the band played a gig at the Warehouse in Preston. The gig was plagued with sound problems but was later released on Dynamic Records. With Martin Hannett, again producing, the band began recording their second album Closer at the end of the European tour in March. On April 8, the band played a gig at the Derby Hall in Bury. After jamming with support band Section 25, Joy Division&#x27;s set began with Alan Hempstall of Crispy Ambulance and Simon Topping of A Certain Ratio filling in for Curtis who was initially too ill to perform. Curtis did manage to return, but only for a few songs. When the band resumed jamming without their singer, some members of the audience protested, turning the gig into a riot in which Hook, Gretton, and other crew members fought with angry onlookers. Death of Curtis Following a one-off gig in early May 1980, the band took a two weeks&#x27; rest before their first American tour was scheduled to start. At the time, Curtis&#x27;s relationship with his wife, Deborah Curtis, was collapsing due to his infidelity with a Belgian woman, Annick Honore, whom he had met on tour (no photograph of Honore had ever been published until the 2006 book Torn Apart: The Life of Ian Curtis by Middles &amp; Reade in which Annick gives her first public account of their relationship). Alone in his Macclesfield home, on May 18, 1980, Curtis reportedly watched Werner Herzog&#x27;s Stroszek -- about an artist who commits suicide -- listened to Iggy Pop&#x27;s debut solo album, The Idiot, and hanged himself. The following day, Curtis&#x27; body was discovered by his wife in their kitchen. Aftermath The band had long decided that if any one of them left or was unable to perform for any reason, they would end the band. In the summer of 1980, Love Will Tear Us Apart hit number 13 on the British singles chart, their biggest commercial success to date. In July 1980, Closer was finally released to overwhelmingly positive reviews; it also charted, peaking at number 6 on the British album chart. Sales of Unknown Pleasures were also robust. At first glance Curtis&#x27; suicide appears to be exclusively the product of his own depression and ill health. Deborah Curtis&#x27; book Touching from a Distance gives the impression that Curtis always wanted to die young. Despite Curtis&#x27; suicide, Joy Division essentially did not end in 1980, as the surviving members immediately toured and soon recorded new music. Eventually renaming themselves New Order and adding Morris&#x27; girlfriend Gillian Gilbert to cover keyboards and second guitar, the band was accordingly reborn. Alternating between guitar-drum-bass and electronic styles, the band&#x27;s music reached and inspired a variety of listeners. New Order is often cited as one of the leading Synth Pop and dance music groups of their era, yet their use of traditional rock instruments such as guitars and live drums has reached a level of influence comparable with their landmark electronic works and they have become one of alternative rock&#x27;s most beloved acts. The band, and especially Ian Curtis, has been an inspiration for a number of musicians that include U2, The Smashing Pumpkins, Trent Reznor (who, as Nine Inch Nails, covered &quot;Dead Souls&quot; for the soundtrack of the movie The Crow), Robert Smith of The Cure and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante. The continuing importance of Joy Division was shown at the turn of the millennium when Peel asked his listeners to vote for the all-time Festive 50. At number one was the haunting Atmosphere, while Love Will Tear Us Apart sat at number three. Three more songs from the band sat on the list. Much of the history of Joy Division was portrayed in the 2002 MGM/United Artists released film 24 Hour Party People which presented a somewhat fictionalised account of the rise and fall of the Factory Records, with whom both Joy Division and New Order were signed. In 2007 the movie Control , directed by Anton Corbijn - depicting Curtis&#x27; life - was released. Curtis&#x27; bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via New Order. The movie title comes from the Joy Division song &quot;She&#x27;s Lost Control&quot;. Also in 2007, the documentary film simply titled Joy Division was released. Directed by Grant Gee, this movie is told by people who were there to experience Joy Division first-hand. The movie outlines the history of the legendary group and their first steps toward gigs and pre-recordings, but this is also the tale of a city - Manchester - which revitalises itself though the growing music scene of the time. The memories to the past are coloured by the suicide of singer Ian Curtis. In 2005 Joy Division were accepted along with New Order into the UK Music Hall of Fame. ", "Warpaint": "Warpaint is a psychedelic rock band which formed in 2004 in Los Angeles, California, United States. The band consists of Theresa Wayman (vocals, guitar), Emily Kokal (vocals, guitar), Jenny Lee Lindberg (vocals, bass), and Stella Mozgawa (drums). The band&#x27;s original drummer, Shannyn Sossamon, left the band in 2008. The band had multiple temporary drummers until Mozgawa joined in 2009. The band weaves intricate guitar lines, hypnotic vocals, and driving post-punk rhythms into gorgeous, sprawling songs that skirt the line between the soundscapes of psychedelia and intimacy. The group has gone through many line-up changes, including actress Shannyn Sossamon and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer. In early 2009, their self-released debut EP &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; soared straight to #1 on legendary Los Angeles Amoeba Records' local artists chart. By September 2009, Manimal Vinyl reissued it on CD and vinyl, complete with a new bonus track, 'Krimson'. Mixed by John Frusciante (Red Hot Chili Peppers), the EP successfully captures the band's sonic textures and playful dynamism that they're notorious for creating in a live setting. With a buzz already in the air, Warpaint is now beginning to stir the masses with praise in the US and abroad. Dazed and Confused calls &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot; &quot;a collection of magical psychedelia drifting over sublime moments of raw melody courtesy of the three free ethereal vocalists,\" while The Independent adds, \"They make a quite lovely sound with dreamy vocals, off-kilter hazy guitars. \" On October 25, 2010, the band released their debut album, The Fool. The album received a glowing review in the NME. Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the band contributed a cover of the David Bowie song &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; to We Were So Turned On, a Bowie tribute album released in conjunction with War Child. &quot;Shadows&quot;, the first single from their debut album, was released as a digital download and 12&quot; vinyl on January 10, 2011. A remix of the single, &quot;Shadows (Neon Lights Remix)&quot;, proved popular; managing to be playlisted by BBC Radio 1 as part of the In New Music We Trust. Warpaint toured the United States and Europe in the spring and summer of 2011 to promote the album. They played at various major festivals including Bonnaroo, Glastonbury Festival, Reading and Leeds Festivals, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Rock Werchter and Electric Picnic. In 2011, the rerelease of Undertow charted in the UK at number 92 and also in Australia at number 75. On September 25, 2011 they played the prestigious Hollywood Bowl (as a support act). As early as 2011, drummer Stella Mozgawa, in an interview with NME, expressed the band&#x27;s intention to &quot;experiment and write with one another&quot; as the current line-up had never composed songs &quot;from the ground up&quot; together. Bassist Jenny Lee Lindberg further indicated that most of the newer songs were written by &quot;just jam and free-flow onstage&quot;. In February 2013, Guitarist Theresa Wayman confirmed to NME that the band intended to create a minimalist sound on Warpaint, revealing that the band developed songs at soundchecks, and experimented more with acoustic guitars and percussion instruments on the album. Lead vocalist Emily Kokal noted that R&amp;B and rap music was an influence on Warpaint and stated that on the album there are &quot;things that have drum machines and ambience, music that&#x27;s more than standard rock. &quot; Kokal added that the album is largely keys-based, which contributed to the overall sound being &quot;definitely different&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous album The Fool (2010). Produced by Flood and mixed by Nigel Godrich, Warpaint is due to be released in Germany, Ireland, Netherlands and Switzerland on January 17, 2014; January 20 in Denmark, France, Sweden and the United Kingdom; and January 21 in Spain and the United States on Rough Trade Records. A snippet of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Love Is to Die&quot;, was featured in an advertisement for Calvin Klein on September 25, 2013 and later as part of a teaser for an upcoming documentary of the same name about the recording of Warpaint. The single was released on October 28 with the pre-ordered digital version of the album. On November 20, Warpaint performed &quot;Composure,&quot; from The Fool, as well as new songs &quot;Love Is to Die&quot; and &quot;Keep It Healthy&quot; on BBC 6 Music with Steve Lamacq in the United Kingdom. The next day, an article from the December 2013 issue of Dazed &amp; Confused magazine appeared online, providing insight into the making of the new album, as well as the accompanying documentary, filmed by Jenny Lee Lindberg&#x27;s husband and filmmaker, Chris Cunningham. Lindberg later confirmed in a November 24 interview on XFM that Cunningham&#x27;s documentary would be made available shortly after the album&#x27;s release. www. warpaintwarpaint. com", "Levon Vincent": "Levon Vincent is a producer and DJ based in Brooklyn. A native of Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side, he has been releasing music since 2002, primarily on his own imprints (Novel Sound, Deconstruct Music, now-defunct More Music NY) as well as through others like Ostgut Ton and Jus-Ed&#x27;s Underground Quality.

Gundersen has been making music since childhood, learning piano at a young age and later teaching himself guitar. He often played in cafes as a teen, occasionally with his younger sister, Abby Gundersen, the two have been formally producing music since 2005. Gundersen&#x27;s music banks on strong lead vocals, boasting a poetic and lyrical charm, backed by ambient backgrounds of strings and percussion. Gundersen&#x27;s music has been called a blend of melancholy folk and electric euphoria, occasionally drawing comparisons to the likes of Elijah Wyman, David Wilcox, and Damien Rice.

Since the release of her 2007 debut single &quot;Ur So Gay&quot;, Perry has released two albums - 2008&#x27;s &quot;One of the Boys&quot; and 2010&#x27;s &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; - and has had six Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit singles. Under the name Katy Hudson, she released a self-titled gospel album in 2001, which was unsuccessful. She later recorded an album with production team The Matrix and completed the majority of a solo album from 2004-05, the later of which was never released. After signing with Capitol Music Group in 2007, her fourth record label in seven years, she adopted the stage name Katy Perry and released her first Internet single &quot;Ur So Gay&quot; that November, which garnered public attention but failed to chart. She rose to fame with the release of her second single &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; in 2008, which went on to top international charts. Perry&#x27;s first mainstream studio album One of the Boys followed later that year and subsequently became the 33rd-best selling album worldwide of 2008. It was accredited platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America, while &quot;I Kissed a Girl&quot; and her second single &quot;Hot n Cold&quot; both received multi-platinum certifications. Her second studio album Teenage Dream was released in August 2010 and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album includes five Billboard chart-toppers &quot;California Gurls&quot;, &quot;Teenage Dream&quot;, &quot;Firework&quot;, and &quot;E. T. &quot; and &quot;Last Friday Night (T. G. I. F. )&quot;, making Teenage Dream only the second album - after Michael Jackson&#x27;s Bad - to have five songs reach #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. With &quot;E. T. &quot; at number one on the chart of May 12, 2011, Perry became the first artist in history to spend 52 consecutive weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. Perry was credited as a guest judge on the seventh series of British television show The X Factor, has released a fragrance called &quot;Purr&quot;, and voices Smurfette in the 2011 film The Smurfs. Perry had a long relationship with Travie McCoy; she married Russell Brand on October 23, 2010. After 14 months of marriage, Brand filed for divorce from Perry on December 30, 2011, in Los Angeles, citing irreconcilable differences. The divorce became effective in July 2012. Prism is the fourth studio album by Perry. The album was released on October 18, 2013. Prism topped the US album charts with first week sales of 286,000 becoming Perry&#x27;s best opening week to date. ", "Portishead": "Portishead are a band from Bristol, United Kingdom, named after a small coastal town twelve miles west of said musical hotbed, in North Somerset. They were initially known for their use of jazz samples and some hip-hop beats along with various synth sounds and the hauntingly beautiful vocals of singer Beth Gibbons. Their current sound drops the samples in favour of a harder, more abrasive edge, but retains Gibbons&#x27; vocals. The band was formed in 1991 (then later split in 2005 reforming in 2008), by keyboardist / multi-instrumentalist Geoff Barrow, Adrian Utley and singer Beth Gibbons. Barrow had previously worked with Massive Attack and Tricky whilst tape operator at Coach House Studios in Clifton. He was often referred to as &quot;that bloke from Portishead&quot; and so decided to name his new musical endeavour after his hometown. &quot;Dummy&quot; (1994) After releasing a short film (To Kill A Dead Man) and its accompanying music, Portishead signed a record deal with Go! Beat and their first album, &#x27;Dummy&#x27;, was released in 1994. It featured heavy contributions from guitarist Adrian Utley. In spite of the band&#x27;s media-shyness, the album gained universal critical acclaim and was successful on both sides of the Atlantic, spawning three hit singles, &quot;Glory Box&quot;, &quot;Sour Times&quot; and &quot;Numb&quot;. The album won the British Mercury Music Prize in 1995 beating albums such as Definitely Maybe by Oasis and Leftfield&#x27;s Leftism. &quot;Portishead&quot; (1997) Their second album, &#x27;Portishead&#x27;, was released in 1997, and featured the single &quot;All Mine&quot;. A live album featuring new orchestral arrangements of the group&#x27;s songs was recorded primarily at Roseland in New York City and released in 1998, as well as a DVD of the Roseland concert. In 2002, Gibbons collaborated on a separate solo project with Paul Webb, or Rustin&#x27; Man. The album, &#x27;Out of Season&#x27;, was released in the UK in October 2002, and a year later was released in the U. S. In the time between &#x27;Portishead&#x27; and &#x27;Third&#x27;, Portishead collaborated with singer Tom Jones for a track on his album &#x27;Reload&#x27;, and also covered Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s &quot;Un Jour Comme Un Autre&quot; (&quot;Requiem for Anna&quot;) in 2006 on the tribute album &#x27;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&#x27;. The band appeared live for the first time in seven years at the 2005 Tsunami Benefit Concert in Bristol. Also in 2005, Utley and Barrow produced The Coral&#x27;s &#x27;The Invisible Invasion&#x27;. Barrow along with Utley, Clive Deamer and John Baggott also assisted with the production of Stephanie McKay&#x27;s &#x27;McKay&#x27; album in 2003 under the Go!Beat label. Utley also contributed to the &#x27;Black Cherry&#x27; album by Goldfrapp. In December 2007, Portishead hosted the ATP Nightmare before Christmas party. Portishead played live on both nights of the festival. The set included 4 new tracks from their then-upcoming new album. Video recordings of Portishead ATP performance can be found on YouTube. &quot;Third&quot; (2008) Portishead&#x27;s long awaited third album simply titled &#x27;Third&#x27; was released at the end of April 2008 to coincide with Coachella, where they were headlining. The first single, &#x27;Machine Gun&#x27;, was released on April 14 as a 12&quot; vinyl. It was made available on (your very own) Last. fm one week before release. In 2009 Geoff Barrow produced the second album Primary Colours by The Horrors. In 2015, Portishead headlined at Latitude Festival in UK on July 18th. ", "Kate Bush": "Kate Bush (born Catherine Bush on 30 July 1958 in Welling, Kent, England, now part of Greater London) is an English singer and songwriter known for her expressive four-octave soprano voice, idiosyncratic and literary lyrics, and eclectic and meticulous musical and production style. She debuted in 1978 with the surprise hit &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; , which was number one in the British music charts for four weeks and the first UK number one by female artist with a self-penned song. Kate will make again UK chart history in 2014 by becoming the first female to score eight albums on the UK Official Albums Chart simultaneously. Whilst learning the violin and piano at St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent Grammar, she caught the ear of Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour who funded some demos, ultimately leading to a deal with EMI (Pink Floyd&#x27;s ultimate record company through the progressive Harvest imprint) when she was sixteen. Over the next two years EMI allowed her to hone her talents to and to finish school without releasing any material&ndash;while maintaining an exclusive contract. Bush&#x27;s first releases were in 1978 with the single Wuthering Heights (which went to number 1 in the UK) followed by the album The Kick Inside . Even from her earliest works, featuring piano as a primary instrument, Bush wove together many diverse influences, melding classical music, rock, and a wide range of folk sources, producing a unique amalgam which has continued throughout her career. Later recordings have moved farther from a rock base, however, notably with the release of The Dreaming in 1982, where she experimented heavily with the then-new technology of sampling. Recorded in the same sessions as Bush's reworking of old material, Director&#x27;s Cut , 50 Words For Snow comprises seven songs \"set against a background of falling snow. \" The album was released through the singer's personal imprint, Fish People, on November 21, 2011. It was Kate Bush&#x27;s 10th studio album. Kate Bush has tackled sensitive and taboo subjects long before it had become fashionable to do so; &quot;Kashka From Baghdad&quot; is a song about a gay male couple; &quot;Breathing&quot; explores the results of nuclear fallout. Her lyrics are often literate and reference a wide array of subject matter, some of which is relatively obscure, such as Wilhelm Reich in &quot;Cloudbusting&quot; , or G. I. Gurdjieff in &quot;Them Heavy People&quot; . The lush arrangements, complex production and intelligent, thoughtful lyrics found in her work can sometimes mask the fact that Kate Bush is a peculiarly witty writer and that comedy is not only a big influence on her -- she has cited Monty Python , Woody Allen, Fawlty Towers and The Young Ones as particular favourites -- but also a significant component of her work. In addition to her British peers, Bush has reportedly cited American musicians Frank Zappa and Devo as musical influences. As a vocalist, she has also provided backing vocals or duets with Peter Gabriel, Roy Harper, Big Country and others. She is often cited as an influence on later artists, most especially female singers such as Jane Siberry, Happy Rhodes and Tori Amos. Kate Bush has collected two Ivor Novello awards: in 1979 &#x27;Outstanding British Lyric&#x27; for &quot;The Man With The Child In His Eyes&quot; and &#x27;Outstanding Contribution To British Music As A Songwriter&#x27; in 2002. In 1987 she scooped &#x27;Best British Female Artist&#x27; at the Brit Awards. In 2001, Kate won Q Magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Classic Songwriter&#x27; award, revealing an unlikely fan in John Lydon who announced, in his acceptance speech for the &#x27;Inspirational Artist Award,&#x27; &quot;I&#x27;d like to say hello to Kate Bush, thank you, your music is f****ng brilliant&quot;. Kate&#x27;s song &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; , from the 1985 album Hounds Of Love , has been covered by Placebo on a number of dates during their 2006 tour. The Futureheads, released a version of Kate&#x27;s &quot;Hounds of Love&quot; as a single, which did rather well. Early in 2014, Kate Bush announced her first tour for 35 years - the last being in 1979 when she performed the \"Tour of Life\", a gruelling series of gigs that concluded with a concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. Tickets for the new tour went on sale on March 28, 2014 and all 22 dates sold out in less than 15 mins. In response, Kate published a message on her website - \"I am completely overwhelmed and genuinely shocked by the incredibly positive response from everyone.  Thank you!\" . The tour, entitled \" Before the Dawn \", started on Tuesday August 26, 2014 and ran through August and September 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo venue in the UK. The closing date was October the 1st. ", "Our Lady Peace": "Our Lady Peace (also known as OLP) is an alternative rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1992. The band has sold over five million albums worldwide, won four Juno Awards, and ten MuchMusic Video Awards. OLP has released eight studio albums to date, with &quot;Clumsy&quot; often being considered the most popularized of the set. The Heavyweight Songfacts reports that their eighth studio album Curve was recorded from 2010 through 2012 at vocalist Raine Maida&#x27;s home recording studio. It was released on April 3, 2012. Full circle: a theme that eagerly resonates with each member of multiplatinum survivors, Our Lady Peace. As the band approached the release of their seventh studio album, a feeling of renewal and excitement washed over Toronto's favorite sons in a manner not felt since their earliest days. Self-produced in lead singer Raine Maida's Los Angeles home studio, the 10-track Burn Burn (in stores July 21 2009), marks the longest period between studio albums for Our Lady Peace. It also signifies a sonic and philosophical rebirth. The band now enjoys a creative and professional freedom that they haven't experienced since the release of their now classic debut. \"I think about the way we made Naveed,\" Maida recalls. \"We were just starting, we knew nothing about the business and we had no expectations. It was four guys in a room just trusting their instincts. We went back to that. 'Liberating' doesn't really even sum it up. \" Burn Burn is a triumphant return to what Maida terms \"a proper, mature rock album,\" steeped in the kind of raw intensity that drove their early material. Blinding rays of anthemic light make way to the tender poise and precision of a band that was looking for a way out and found a satisfying new way in. With caution thrown to the wind, tracks such as the stunningly arranged \"Dreamland\" and the overpowering first single, \"All You Did Was Save My Life,\" soar above angry clouds of confusion and insecurity with an ascending clarity that can only come from experience and growth. The pounding affirmation of \"The Right Stuff\" and the vigilant build of band favorite \"Refuge,\" also reinforce the notion that OLP now occupy a unique and enviable mindspace. \"We're not looking back with any kind of regret,\" Maida points out, \"but we've been doing this long enough now that we know what we want to say. We didn't want to compromise a thing. \" Having scattered in different directions after the release of 2005's Healthy In Paranoid Times, all four members took on projects of their own, ranging from solo records, production and songwriting work, tours and guest performances. Over the last two years, Raine Maida, guitarist Steve Mazur, bassist Duncan Coutts and drummer Jeremy Taggart sporadically reconvened and lived at Madia's home, creating what he calls their best effort to date. Members would leave each session without tapes, giving themselves a much fresher perspective on the material they created when they returned. Producing themselves and an adherence to rolling tape off the floor gave birth to an urgent, natural body of work. \"We didn't put a lot of pressure on ourselves,\" Coutts confirms. \"We left things alone and haven&#x27;t done that in a long time. &quot; \"For us,\" adds Maida, \"a big part of this band is playing live. It has to be something that we're going to enjoy; a real dynamic collection of songs. When we really started to understand that, the record took on this whole other life. \" This work ethic allowed room for guitarist Steve Mazur, who joined the band in 2002, to blossom on Burn Burn. \"On this album I really felt comfortable with my role and what I sound like as the guitarist of Our Lady Peace. \" Mazur shines on tracks such as \"Escape Artist\" and \"Paper Moon,\" a song where Mazur's solowork was nailed on the first go-round. Our Lady Peace is also striking out on their own professionally this time around, opting for what the band terms a \"true partnership\" with both North American record labels. \"We've never been this prepared for an album,\" adds OLP founding member Jeremy Taggart. \"In the past, we've never had the foresight to have maybe two or three singles in the can already with videos, etc. \" \"Nobody knows us better than ourselves,\" Taggart continues. \"We didn't over think a good song or idea or under think anything. The good songs really picked themselves. \"", "the GazettE": "the GazettE is a visual kei rock band from Japan.

Official website: http://www. pscompany. co. jp/gazette/ MySpace: http://www. myspace. com/thegazetteofficial", "of Montreal": "of Montreal is an indie pop band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1997. The band is fronted by Kevin Barnes, who writes, composes, and plays most of the music for his albums. They were among the second wave of groups to emerge from The Elephant 6 Recording Company and the group has a style that is typical of many Elephant 6 bands due to their interest in combining musical experimentation with the basic tenets of pop i. e. catchy melodies and sing-along choruses. The band's style has been influenced by conventional indie pop, psychedelic music, vaudeville and music hall on their earlier releases and by afrobeat, funk, krautrock and reggae on their recent releases. The band's style has been known to change between albums. At first, the band embraced a more simple, quirky, lo-fi indie pop sound, which occasionally bordered on twee pop. The band was created by Kevin Barnes and named after a failed romance with a woman from Montreal, though the story changes in various interviews. Barnes was the only member of the \"group\" prior to his relocation to Athens, Georgia. There, he met Derek Almstead, later of Circulatory System, M Coast, Elf Power etc. , and Bryan Poole, who also performs as The Late B. P. Helium. Together, they recorded their first album, Cherry Peel, as well as The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower and The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy. A number of singles and a re-release of The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower occurred before the release of the band's third album, The Gay Parade in 1999. With contributions from several members of the Elephant Six collective at the time, it also featured artwork from Kevin's brother David Barnes, who would continue to do artwork for future albums. This album marked that the band had moved to a fuller sound, which is also found on its follow-up, Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse. These two albums contain more narrative lyrics, as opposed to the rather personal lyrical matter of those preceding it, and often imitating the style of old 1950s radio plays. After production on The Gay Parade began in 1998, Poole left the band to focus on his duties with Elf Power, another Elephant Six band from Athens. Barnes also recruited Jamey Huggins and Dottie Alexander, who had been performing together as Lightning Bug vs. Firefly, to play various instruments. Derek moved from drums to bass. The band was joined soon after by Marshmallow Coast's Andy Gonzales. Following the release of The Gay Parade, the band signed with Kindercore Records, who would release a number of singles and compilations. It wasn't until 2001 that Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse would be released as a new album with original material. The album again featured contributions from across the Elephant 6 spectrum. In 2002, Aldhils Arboretum was released, with a slightly different sound than its predecessors, as the songs were more directly structured. This album marks the beginning of the change in of Montreal's sound, with more danceable rhythms than ever before, especially on the album's closer, \"Death Dance Of The Omipapas and Sons For You\". A successful tour ensued, including of Montreal's first trip to the UK, along with a tour-only EP. Kindercore Records would fold shortly after the release of Arboretum, and of Montreal's status was also threatened. Kevin got married, and Andy and Derek left the band. Barnes, being uncomfortable with the unrest, as well as some divisions within the band, took to writing and performing their 2004 album Satanic Panic in the Attic mostly by himself. Released by Polyvinyl Records, it became one of their more successful efforts to that point. The 2004 tour saw The Late B. P. Helium (Bryan Poole) rejoin the band, with some bass played by Kevin's partner Nina Barnes. The album marked a shift to something more electronic with traditional structures, to be further advanced in later albums and new songs. In their most recent releases and concerts, the band has fully embraced a sort of techno-pop glam image, with little of their previous incarnations surfacing. This style is featured in singles such as Disconnect the Dots. The style would continue to evolve into 2005's The Sunlandic Twins, which was even more a Barnes solo effort. Recorded in Athens, with the exception of one track recorded in Norway, it was a much more pronounced electronic album. The album became a success, mostly due to the singles \"So Begins Our Alabee\" and the MTV clip for \"Wraith Pinned to the Mist (and Other Games)\". The band released several collections of singles in early 2006. Barnes recorded most of the band's 2007 release, Hissing Fauna, Are You The Destroyer?, by himself while living in Norway and Athens, Georgia. The switch to autobiographical themes of suicide, depression and isolation of the album was a direct product of his troubled personal life during that period. of Montreal released Skeletal Lamping on October 21, 2008 followed by False Priest on September 14, 2010, Paralytic Stalks on February 7, 2012, and Lousy with Sylvianbriar on October 8, 2013. Aureate Gloom is scheduled for release by Polyvinyl Records on March 3, 2015. Lyrically, their style has changed dramatically throughout the years. In the beginning, many songs were narratives of personal or humorous situations, such as \"Tim, I Wish You Were Born A Girl\", from Cherry Peel. This style, however, changed with The Gay Parade, where many songs involve small narratives surrounding invented characters (in songs such as \"Jacques Lamure\", \"The Autobiographical Grandpa\", \"Mimi Merlot\" and \"Rose Robert\"). Others act as extracts from fictional conversations (\"Advice From a Divorced Gentleman to His Bachelor Friend Considering Marriage\" and \"Good Morning Mr. Edminton\" as examples). With Aldhils Arboretum came a slight return to the previous writing style, except following more poppy, classical lyrical structures (such as the use of choruses, which are generally absent in the Gay Parade/Coquelicot years). This style continued throughout Satanic Panic and The Sunlandic Twins to some extent. On the album Hissing Fauna: Are You The Destroyer? the lyrics are much more personal than previously used, with songs detailing emotions within the speaker. Another unique quality of the band is the fusion of ostensibly gloomy lyrics with bouncy, upbeat melodies and hooks. On Aldhils Arboretum, for example, the lyrics for tracks like \"Doing Nothing\" and \"Old People in the Cemetery\" focus on apathy, loneliness or death while being contrasted with cheerful instrumentation. Another example of this tendency is shown in their choice of covers; for example, Yoko Ono's \"I Felt Like Smashing my Head Through a Clear Glass Window\" from The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower. True to the style of most Elephant 6 recording artists, of Montreal's members have been in a variety of side projects and other bands: The band itself has performed as the backing band for Marshmallow Coast on record and on tour. My First Keyboard was the pseudonym used by Dottie Alexander to release the song \"The You I Created\" on the Kindercore singles club. of Montreal acted as her backing band. ", "Now  Now": "Now, Now (formerly known as Now, Now Every Children) is an American indie rock band formed in Blaine, Minnesota and based in Minneapolis. The band is composed of Cacie Dalager (vocals, guitar, keyboard), Bradley Hale (drums, backing vocals), and Jess Abbott (guitar, vocals) The band was formed in roughly 2003. Classmates Cacie Dalager and Bradley Hale met in high school marching band when they were both sixteen years old; they eventually started writing songs together, starting with an acoustic song dedicated to a college-bound friend. The band&#x27;s name, according to Dalager, came about as a typo while talking to friends online on their old band&#x27;s account; it was originally being considered jokingly as a possible future EP title, but stuck as the band name when they officially started the project. Dalager and Hale were joined by Brad&#x27;s sister Britty on keyboards, and school friend Justin Schweim on bass for the recording of their first EP and their first few shows in the Minneapolis area. Shortly before the band began recording their first album, Schweim left their live setup, and Christine Sako stepped in. Jess Abbott joined the band in Summer 2009 after moving from Maine to Minnesota, initially just for the summer until she left for college, however she became a permanent member shortly after. The band have released two full length albums and 5 ep&#x27;s", "Tool": "Formed around 1990 in Los Angeles, California, United States, by drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, vocalist Maynard James Keenan, and original bassist Paul D&#x27;Amour, Tool is a band that is most noted for combining alternative metal with a wide variety of progressive structures, irregular time signatures and lyrics that range from angry diatribes to meditations on philosophical and social matters. After performing a handful of shows in the Los Angeles area and up the West Coast, they toured in the United States with Primus in the summer of 1992 in support of their EP Opiate. Their first full length recording, Undertow, was released in 1993. Emerging with a groovy heavy industrial sound on their first release, when the genre was dominated by post-punk, they were later seen at the top of the industrial metal movement with the release of their second full-length studio album AEnima in 1996, the first recording the band made after original bassist Paul D'Amour left the band, replaced by Justin Chancellor. After an ongoing evolution of their sound and continuous efforts to unify musical experimentation, visual arts, and a message of personal evolution on Lateralus (2001), their most recent album 10,000 Days (2006), as well as respective tours, they are generally described as a style-transgressing act and part of progressive and art rock. Their aspirational work features exceptionally long or complex releases, controversial lyrics and cover art, and unorthodox music videos, which results in a rather ambivalent relationship between the band and today's music industry, at times marked by censorship, and the band's ongoing struggle for privacy. Nevertheless, Tool has won Grammy Awards and continues to perform worldwide and receive critical acclaim. Lateralus and 10,000 Days both debuted number one on the US Billboard 200 as well as topping the charts in numerous other countries. Between album releases, the band takes extended breaks that allow for collaboration with other artists in designing award-winning album packaging, the creation of elaborate light shows, and band member involvement in notable side-projects. They currently have 6 major releases: Opiate (1992) Undertow (1993) AEnima (1996) Salival (Live) (2000) Lateralus (2001) 10,000 Days (2006). ", "Guns N' Roses": "Guns N&#x27; Roses is an American hard rock band founded in Los Angeles, California in 1985. The band has released six studio albums: Appetite For Destruction in 1987, G N&#x27; R Lies in 1988, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II in 1991, &quot;The Spaghetti Incident?&quot; in 1993 and, after 15 years and with frontman Axl Rose being the only member of the original lineup remaining, Chinese Democracy in 2008. They also released an EP titled Live ?!*@ Like a Suicide in 1986 and two live albums, in 1999 and 2014. The group was formed in early 1985 by Hollywood Rose members Axl Rose (vocals) and Izzy Stradlin (rhythm guitar) and L. A. Guns members Tracii Guns (lead guitar), Ole Beich (bass) and Rob Gardner (drums). The band created its name by combining two of the members&#x27; names. A short time later, Beich was fired and replaced by Duff McKagan, and Guns was replaced by Slash after not showing up to rehearsal. Slash had played with McKagan in Road Crew and with Stradlin during a short stint in Hollywood Rose. On their first tour (from Sacramento, California to Duff&#x27;s home town of Seattle), Gardner quit and was replaced by Slash&#x27;s friend, Steven Adler. Stemming from the LA rock underground, the ugly lyrics matched the sleaze of the music&ndash;driven by heavy blues licks&ndash;covering misogyny, violence, city life, sex, liquor, and hard drugs. They also, however, had a tendency to show sensitivity and a desire to break free from the city. Subsequent albums revealed influence from bands in the vein of The Rolling Stones and Queen. Their 1987 breakthrough, Appetite for Destruction, (18-times platinum and the highest-selling debut album of all-time), coupled with the success of the hit single &quot;Sweet Child O&#x27; Mine&quot; in 1988, took the world by storm. &quot;Appetite&quot; was full of raunchy hard rock with blistering, anthemic guitar riffs and snarling vocals. The followup EP, &quot;G N&#x27; R Lies&quot;, contained four songs from their debut EP, three new acoustic songs, and an acoustic version of &quot;You&#x27;re Crazy&quot;. The album sold well and got into the top 10 alongside Appetite. By the end of the 1980s, they were one of the most popular bands in the world. Steven Adler (original drummer) was kicked out of the band due to his drug abuse and replaced by Matt Sorum. Following the release of G N&#x27; R Lies, Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II made history by making the number 1 and 2 spots on the American Billboard Album chart. The albums were filled with songs that pushed Guns into a different direction, far from the Appetite era. They surprised critics who expected hard rock songs but found more &quot;epic&quot; tracks featuring a wider range of instruments (pianos, brass instruments, various effects, etc). The main response was that instead of releasing two albums that included &quot;filler tracks&quot;, they could have released one CD. The band then started a world tour to support the albums. During this tour, rhythm guitarist Izzy Stradlin quit the band due to differences with Slash, Sorum and McKagan due to his newfound sobriety and Stradlin&#x27;s anger at Rose&#x27;s management of the band. They played 192 shows in the 28-month tour, which set attendance records and concluded with a show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on July 17, 1993. This show marked the last time original members Slash and McKagan and newcomers Clarke and Sorum would play a live show with Rose. Axl began work on a new album of original material in 1993. In 1994, Gilby Clarke left the band, and was replaced with Paul Tobias. That same year, the band recorded a cover version of The Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; for the movie Interview with the Vampire. According to Slash&#x27;s 2007 autobiography, the first version of guitar track was rejected by Axl, who wanted Slash to copy Keith Richards&#x27; playing on the original. Reluctantly, Slash agreed and recorded another version closer to the original. Slash was further infuriated when he discovered Tobias&#x27; guitar copying his own solo note by note layered in the final mix of the song. This would be the last recording by the original version of the band, and five years would go by before any new material came out under the Guns N&#x27; Roses name. Slash drifted in and out of the band for the next couple of years, beginning a side project called Slash&#x27;s Snakepit. In August 1996, GN&#x27;R returned to the studio, even though McKagan and Sorum were simultaneously touring with their side project, Neurotic Outsiders. Eventually, only Slash and Rose were left to continue working. During this period, Slash commented in an interview, &quot;My relationship with Axl right now is sort of at a stand still. &quot; Additionally, Axl had approached guitarist Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne, Black Label Society) about jamming and possibly joining Guns N&#x27; Roses. In 1996 and 1997, Slash, Sorum and McKagan all left the band for good, leaving Rose as the only remaining charter member of the band. The three later formed rock supergroup Velvet Revolver with former Stone Temple Pilots frontman Scott Weiland and guitarist Dave Kushner. In 1998, a &quot;clean&quot; (i. e. , profanity removed) version of Use Your Illusion was released (in the USA only), mainly so the album could be sold in Wal-Mart and K-Mart stores. The album, titled &quot;Use Your Illusion&quot; was a 1 CD compilation of the 2 albums. Also in 1998, Axl put a new version of the band together and returned to the studio. This version of the band has been touring and recording sporadically ever since. The new band&#x27;s membership has changed frequently, but its core members have included guitarist Robin Finck, effects man Chris Pitman, bassist Tommy Stinson (formerly of The Replacements)-- as well as Paul Tobias, drummer Josh Freese and longtime GN&#x27;R keyboardist Dizzy Reed. In 1999, the band released one new song, &quot;Oh My God&quot;, on the soundtrack of the film End of Days. The track featured additional guitar work by Dave Navarro and Gary Sunshine, Rose&#x27;s personal guitar teacher. The song&#x27;s release was intended to be a prelude to their new album, now officially entitled Chinese Democracy. Geffen also released Live Era &#x27;87-&#x27;93, a collection of live performances from various concerts during the Appetite for Destruction and Use Your Illusion tours. Also in 1999, during an interview with Kurt Loder for MTV, Axl said that he had re-recorded Appetite for Destruction with the new band, replacing two songs with &quot;Patience&quot; and &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot;. In 1999, guitarist Robin Finck departed the band in order to rejoin his former band, Nine Inch Nails, on tour. In 2000, virtuoso guitarist Buckethead joined Guns N&#x27; Roses as a replacement for Finck. Josh Freese was replaced with Bryan &quot;Brain&quot; Mantia (formerly of Primus). Robin Finck returned to Guns N&#x27; Roses in late 2000 to complement Buckethead on lead guitar. The revised lineup finally made a public appearance in January 2001 with two well-received concerts, one in Las Vegas and one at the Rock in Rio Festival in Rio de Janeiro. The band played a mixture of old hits and new songs from their forthcoming album. The new lineup played a further two shows in Las Vegas at the end of 2001. In 2002, rhythm guitarist Paul Tobias left the band because of his frustrations with life on the road. He was replaced by Richard Fortus (formerly of The Psychedelic Furs and Love Spit Love). The band then played several shows in August 2002, headlining festivals and concerts throughout Asia and Europe. They made their way to New York for a surprise appearance at the MTV Video Music Awards in September. In 2002, the band&#x27;s first North American tour since 1993 was organized to support Chinese Democracy. However, the opening show in Vancouver was canceled by the venue when Rose arrived late due to his plane being held up by bad weather conditions at Los Angeles airport. A riot ensued. This tour was met with mixed results. Some concerts did not sell well, while shows in larger markets such as New York sold out in minutes. Due to a second riot by fans in Philadelphia, tour promoter Clear Channel canceled the remainder of the tour. The band went on hiatus until they were scheduled to play at Rock in Rio IV in May 2004. However, Buckethead left the band in March of that year, causing them to cancel. Also in March 2004, Geffen released Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; Greatest Hits, since Rose had failed to deliver a new studio album in more than 10 years. Rose expressed displeasure with this album as its track listing was established without his consent and went as far as trying to block its release by suing Geffen. This failed, however, and the album went triple platinum in the USA. In February 2006, demos of the songs &quot;Better&quot;, &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, &quot;I. R. S. &quot; and &quot;There Was a Time&quot; were leaked through a fan site. The band&#x27;s management requested that all links to the MP3 files and all lyrics to the songs be removed from forums and web sites. Despite this, radio stations began adding &quot;I. R. S. &quot; to playlists, and the song reached #49 on the Radio &amp; Records Active Rock National Airplay chart in the final week of February - the first time an internet leak had done so. On May 5, 2006, Axl appeared on the Friday Night Rocks with Eddie Trunk radio show (during an interview with ex-Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach) and said the new Guns N&#x27; Roses album would be released before the end of the year. Later in May, the band launched a European tour, headlining both the Download Festival and Rock In Rio - Lisbon. Four warm-up shows preceded the tour at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City and became the band&#x27;s first live concert dates since the aborted 2002 tour. The shows also marked the debut of virtuoso guitarist and composer Ron &quot;Bumblefoot&quot; Thal, replacing Buckethead. During the tour, Bach and Izzy Stradlin made frequent guest appearances. By the tour&#x27;s end in 2007, the band had played to over 750 000 people in over 23 countries. On April 5, 2008, a picture of Finck appeared on Nine Inch Nails web page under the title &quot;Welcome Back!&quot; starting the rumor of his possible reunion with Trent Reznor. On April 11, Finck expressed his happiness on playing again with NIN. On April 20, on Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; web site, Axl expressed surprise about the news. Chinese Democracy had been given the tentative release date of March 6, then reported September 17, 2007. However, both dates passed with no sign of the album. After further release dates were discussed, the album finally came out on November 23, 2008. Slash, McKagan and Sorum still play together in Velvet Revolver. However, Izzy Stradlin, original GN&#x27;R rhythm guitarist and co-composer of many of the band&#x27;s most successful songs, has not joined them. He did however play a few dates as a guest with GN&#x27;R in the summer of 2006. Keyboard player Dizzy Reed, while not a founding member of the band (joining in 1990 in the Use Your Illusion period), remains in the current incarnation. GN&#x27;R&#x27;s current lineup includes Rose (lead vocals), Stinson (bass), Fortus (rhythm guitar), Thal (guitar), Chris Pitman (synth &amp; programming), Frank Ferrer (drums) and Reed (keyboard and percussion). Guitarist DJ Ashba was the band&#x27;s second guitarist from 2009 until he left in 2015.

", "Ought": "Ought is a band formed in Montreal, Canada. Guitarist and vocalist Tim Beeler, originally a folk musician hailing from New Hampshire, fell in with New Jersey native Matt May (keyboards) and Australian emigre Tim Keen (drums, violin) - the three of them began sharing an apartment that doubled as practice space, where they were soon joined by Portland,OR transplant Ben Stidworthy on bass. Ought played its first show and recorded its first &quot;New Calm EP&quot; in the apartment&#x27;s largest bedroom, in the summer of 2012. The band busted out into the city&#x27;s loft circuit, and into the city streets during the Printemps d&#x27;Erable Quebec student general strike, in the spring of the same year. Following another recording session in early 2013 and the release of a second EP via Bandcamp, Ought spent a few days at the Hotel2Tango studio with engineer Radwan Moumneh (Suuns, Matana Roberts, Jerusalem In My Heart) in fall 2013 at the invitation of Constellation, laying down a clutch of songs new and old that comprise the band&#x27;s first &quot;proper&quot; full-length album. More Than Any Other Day was released by Constellation on April 29, 2014. A 24-minute, four-track EP followed on October 28. Once More With Feeling&#8230; was released as a 10&quot; and digital. Pill was chosen as the title track. http://oughtontheinternet. tumblr. com", "Motley Crue": "Motley Crue was formed in 1981, in Los Angeles, by bassist Nikki Sixx and drummer Tommy Lee. They would soon find guitarist Mick Mars through a classified ad which stated simply: Loud, rude, aggressive guitarist available. Singer Vince Neil would be the last to join, whom Tommy had known in high school. They would go on to become the most infamous band of the 80&#x27;s. Later in 1981 they would release their first album, Too Fast For Love , on their own Leathur Records, which sold over 20,000 copies. This caught the attention of Elektra Records, who would sign the band and release their second album in 1983, Shout At The Devil . Elektra would also remix and re-release Too Fast For Love , chopping off the intro to the title track and dropping Stick To Your Guns altogether. They would release Theatre Of Pain in 1985, Girls, Girls, Girls in 1987, Dr. Feelgood in 1989, embarking on sold out tours for each one. In 1991 they would release Decade Of Decadence , a best hits compilation with a few new tracks. If February 1992 Vince Neil would leave the band, to be replaced by John Corabi (The Scream). They would release the self-titled Motley Crue in 1994, which sold in disappointing numbers. Vince would return for 1997&#x27;s Generation Swine , which again sold in poor volume. The band would leave Elektra records, to form their own Motley Records, bringing with them ownership of all their master recordings. A band in control of its own publishing and masters is something very rare in the recording industry. They would release remastered versions of all their albums to date in 1999, each one containing bonus tracks of previously unreleased material from that era. That year would also see a new album, New Tattoo , selling less than 150,000 copies, and tension between Vince and Tommy would cause the latter to leave the band. Tommy would put together the band Methods Of Mayhem and record an album with them. It was released late in 1999, and solo albums were released in 2002 and 2005. He starred in a reality TV show which followed him to college in 2005, too. With Motley Crue essentially finished, 2000 would see Nikki Sixx start a rap-rock band called 58 and release a single and album that year. Then in 2002 he would start putting together Brides Of Destruction, and release two albums with them in 2004 and 2005. Near the end of 2004 the unthinkable happened&#8230;reunion! Nobody thought it would ever happen, but the time spent apart was apparently enough of a cooling-off period to make reconciliation a possibility. They would go into the studio to record a few new tracks for 2005&#x27;s compilation, Red, White and Crue , which was released in February. They would embark on their Carnival Of Sins tour that same month, quickly selling out shows. They would release a concert DVD later that year of their stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. January 26th, 2006, rock&#x27;s most infamous bad boys celebrated their 25th anniversary with a star on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk Of Fame! They&#x27;re slated to go back into the studio in May of 2006 with long-time producer Bob Rock to begin work on a new album. ", "Tiesto": "Tiesto is a is a Dutch DJ and record producer.

The Man is an experimental indie rock four-piece centered on frontman John Baldwin Gourley's abstract musical approach and corresponding upbringing. He was raised in a sort of technological isolation: his log cabin home in the winter wasteland of the fringes of Wasilla, Alaska was powered by a generator and had no telephone. Both of his parents helped completely immerse him in the unique lifestyle that comes with a land of seasonal darkness and perpetual cold with their jobs as dog sled mushers. Gourley's innate curiosity and individual spirit combined with a fascination with science fiction and experiences of homelessness create a distinctly transcendent sound that is always open to interpretation and change. Even though members were born in Alaska, the band formed in Portland, Oregon, USA, in 2004 with the union of Gourley (vocals, guitar, organ, machines) and his childhood friend Zachary Scott Carothers (Bass, percussion, vocals) after the break-up of their band Anatomy Of A Ghost. Jason Sechrist (Drums and Gang) of Portland, OR joined in 2005. Current lineup includes Ryan Neighbors (Piano, Rhodes, Organ, Synth, Vocals). They are however known for fluidity in both their music and their lineup and often feature guest appearances. The band's debut album, Waiter: \"You Vultures!\" was released by Fearless Records on January 24th, 2006. On June 22, 2007 they released their second full length, Church Mouth. The band then set out on a full US tour with support from The Photo Atlas, Play Radio Play, Tera Melos, and The Only Children. They then toured Europe, and followed it up with another US headlining tour with support from Rocky Votolato and Great Depression during September and October. Following this tour, they joined Thursday on a short east coast tour in November alongside Circle Takes the Square. Portugal. The Man collaborated with the band The Sound of Animals Fighting on the re-release of their first album, \"Tiger and the Duke. \" Portugal. The Man remixed three of the songs on that album. On July 30, 2008, it was announced that Portugal. The Man would release Censored Colors under its independent record label, Approaching AIRballoons, with a partnership with EQUAL VISION RECORDS. The album was released September 16, 2008. On April 9th, 2009, Portugal. The Man announced a fourth studio album, The Satanic Satanist. It was released on July 21, 2009. As of October 2009, It was announced through Twitter that Portugal. The Man have completed another album entitled \"American Ghetto\" which combines their progressive rock style from their latter albums with some of the electo style from their \"Its Complicated Being A Wizard\" release. A listening party was held for a group of 17 fans in Los Angeles CA. The album was released on March 2, 2010. The Got it All (This Can't Be Living Now) Songfacts reports the band's sixth album and first for Atlantic, In the Mountain in the Cloud, was released on July 19, 2011. It was last spring 2012, and John Gourley--frontman of Portugal. The Man--found himself in New York City about to ring the bell at Danger Mouse's apartment&ndash;a long way from his current home in Portland, and farther still from his real home in Alaska. Six full-length albums in six years, nonstop touring, a stint with The Black Keys and festival stops at Coachella, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza--up until this moment, Portugal. The Man embodied all dimensions of DIY rock range. When it came time to begin work on the seventh album, Gourley thought long and hard about the next move and kept coming back to one concept: The most satisfying work is collaborative work. From building houses with his father in Alaska to building a devoted fanbase, he had sought partnerships. So he took a bold step -- bold for a proven band, bolder still for its uncertainty of sound -- a step up to the apartment of a possible collaborator, Danger Mouse. \"I walked into his place,\" Gourley remembers now. \"And it wasn't going to happen. He was like, 'Hey, man, just so you know, I don't really want to record a rock band. ' And I was a little relieved. We'd done this by ourselves before, and we knew we could do it by ourselves again. \" But then they got to listening, and to talking about how much Danger Mouse had loved In the Mountain in the Cloud -- the 2011 followup to Portugal. The Man's break out record The Satanic Satanist. \"From that very first meeting,\" says Danger Mouse, \"we were very ambitious about what we could do. . . otherwise there was no point. So we decided: Let's try and make something really special. \" So Danger Mouse -- aka Brian Burton, the five-time Grammy award winning producer behind everything from Gnarls Barkley and Beck to The Black Keys and now U2 --and the band agreed that they were game for the challenge and began production on what would become Evil Friends, the undaunted re-awakening for Portugal. The Man. As much as their collaborative imaginations melded, to construct songs that lived up to the ambitious visions they had would take some time. After all, here was a band with an evolving lineup -- Kyle O'Quin on keyboards, Noah Gersh on guitar/percussion/keyboards, and Kane Ritchotte on drums joined Zach Carothers on bass and vocals and Gourley on lead vocals and guitar -- building new songs with a new producer trying to do something neither of them had done before. They went, together, to Los Angeles and worked through several sessions -- at Mondo Studios, Eltro Vox Studios, and Kingsize Soundlabs. The band worked months longer than they ever had on one thing. And somehow -- maybe it was the collaboration in the air, or maybe sheer will -- they finally stopped searching and started realizing: \"What really brought our record together was getting past that period of looking for something, and figuring out how to do something really new, really hard, and really satisfying,\" said Gourley. Each track on Evil Friends is as different from the next as Portugal. The Man's previous records were from each other, which is to say a piece of a growing mindscape, and wholly a part of the group's tumbling fever dream. Where the 2009 hit People Say was a cheery guitar rally, the new title track is a bells-and-balls ballad emerging from darkness into a pipe-whistling punky thump, albeit with Gourley's trademark falsetto and thundering guitar. And yet here is Evil Friends swirling, like a tornado that sends a napping child toward Oz, into something of a tale of Portugal. The Man's arousal from when it decided to make something special to when it actually did: The weighted down questions of \"Plastic Soldiers\" (Could it be we got lost in the summer? / Well I know you know that it's over) give way to the confident melodies of \"Modern Jesus\" (The only rule we need is never giving up / The only faith we have is faith in us) and finally, brazenly, to the anthem \"Smile\" (We watched the sun come up / But took it down to hide it / Seems like the spring has come and gone / It felt like forever). It took all year, and Portugal. The Man -- a group guaranteed for seven years to pump out a record, to tour and tour and tour, to tuck its fans to bed at night with a community of psychedelic rock -- had learned to slow down and transform all-day, all-night recording with Danger Mouse into adrenaline, into words that are at once dark and light, into sounds that are overlapping with danger and charm. The whole \"evil friends\" thing was just a happy writing accident, by the way, a lyrical coincidence belying a collaborative friendship Burton says taught him, too: \"I felt like I was watching them do something special and I wanted to let them do it, so sometimes I was more hands-on, but sometimes more hands-off than I had been with anyone,\" says Danger Mouse. \"They had done enough albums that I thought it would be fun to shake it up a little bit. \" \"In the beginning, I asked Brian why he had wanted to talk about making a record,\" recalls Gourley. \"And he admitted that he was surprised when he saw us live. 'I didn't know you guys could sound like that. ' There had been this perception that we've been something else -- and I've noticed it, at festivals, everywhere -- that we were something we were not. But then we got in a room with Danger Mouse, to the place where we could just throw that out, wake up and say, Here we are. We're this band! Let's just make it, together. \"", "Gregory Porter": "Gregory Porter was born in Los Angeles, raised in Bakersfield, and is now living in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, Gregory Porter has made the world his musical home. With a voice that can caress or confront, embrace or exhort, Gregory Porter exhibits such an incredible degree of vocal mastery that no less a jazz luminary than Wynton Marsalis has gone on record to call him &quot;a fantastic young singer,&quot; which makes the fact that Water is his recording debut even more impressive. A debut release it may be, yet Water flows with a sense of timelessness that reflects the seasoned talents of the giants of blues, gospel and soul that have influenced Porter throughout his career. Some of the singers that Porter cites as influential are familiar - Nat King Cole, Joe Williams, and Donny Hathaway - and others - such as the pastor of the church he attended as a child among them - may never realize their impact on his development as an artist. While the work of singers such as Hathaway or Cole obviously helped to shape Porter's vocal styling, his own world view, as evidenced in his seven original compositions and his striking interpretation of classic songs such as &quot;But Beautiful&quot;, and &quot;Skylark&quot; adds an emotional intensity that makes each of the albums&#x27;s eleven tracks speak so eloquently. The album Water was produced by saxophonist, pianist and composer Kamau Kenyatta, who Porter refers to as his \"best friend. \" In fact, it is Kenyatta who bears much of the responsibility for Porter's career trajectory, which can be traced back to Porter's early days singing in small jazz clubs in San Diego. He lived there while at San Diego State University which he attended on a football scholarship, as an outside linebacker, until a shoulder injury sidelined him permanently. Recognizing his talents, Kenyatta - along with saxophonist Daniel Jackson (Ray Charles, Buddy Rich, Art Farmer, and more) - nurtured the burgeoning performer, and, as Porter says, \"taught him what he needed to know. \" Kenyatta invited Porter to visit him in the studio in Los Angeles, where he was producing the flutist Hubert Laws' Remembers the Unforgettable Nat King Cole. Certainly Kenyatta was aware of Porter's childhood infatuation with Cole's music, and certainly he could hear the echoes of Cole's mellow baritone in Porter's own voice. What he could not have predicted was that when Laws heard Porter singing along when he was tracking the Charlie Chaplin-penned \"Smile,\" the flutist would be so impressed with the young singer that he would choose to include a 'bonus' track of Porter singing the song on the album. Just as serendipitous was Laws' sister, Eloise's, presence that day in the studio. A highly respected singer and recording artist in her own right, Eloise was about to join the cast of a new musical theater work, \"It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues. \" Although he'd only had minimal theatrical experience to that point (in the Doo Wop musical \"Avenue X\"), Porter eventually was cast in one of eight lead roles when the play opened in Colorado at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and eventually followed it to Off-Broadway and then Broadway theater, where the NY Times, in its 1999 rave review, mentioned Porter among the show's \"powerhouse line up of singer. \" \"It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues\" went on to earn both Tony and Drama Desk Award nominations that year. Although he now says, \"I never felt that my career was going to be strictly in the theater,\" Porter's success on stage with \"It Ain't Nothin' But the Blues\" paved the way for another theatrical outing and pairing with Eloise Laws. In his semi-autobiographical \"Nat King Cole and Me,\" he dramatically documented his childhood, which was marked by an absentee father and the joy and pain he heard when listening to his mother's Nat King Cole records. Apparently, one day, when his mother heard her young son singing along, she remarked that he sounded like Cole. This led to a rich imaginary life where the young Porter actually believed that the legendary crooner was indeed his dad, and that the love songs Cole sang were secretly being sung to him. Porter's moving \"Nat King Cole &amp; Me\" ran for two very successful months at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts and has since travelled to Houston, TX (without Porter's involvement. ) The intimacy of Porter's \"Nat King Cole and Me,\" revealed a courageous thespian, who bravely shared his life story with his audience, so it's hardly surprising that many of the songs on Water come also from an emotional place. The album Water opens with the ruminative &quot;Illusion&quot; an exquisite duet between Porter and pianist Chip Crawford, which the singer says was inspired by the pain that will accompany every relationship at one time or another. The song ends with Porter exhaling a quiet sigh - whether it's one of resignation or acceptance depends, he says, on perspective. \"Love makes us all crazy,\" he says. &quot;Pretty&quot;, a soulful tribute to a woman from Porter's past, is an understated ensemble piece that is bolstered by the alto sax work of Yoske Sato. \"I love coffee,\" says Porter, \"and &quot;Magic Cup&quot; was written for a beautiful friend who works at my favorite coffee shop. \" Percolating with a smooth energy heightened by frenetic sax breaks courtesy of Sato, the song is as rich as a morning cup of French roast. Porter's effluent baritone does the Hoagie Carmichael/Johnny Mercer standard, &quot;Skylark&quot; more than justice, while his rendition of Wayne Shorter&#x27;s &quot;Black Nile&quot; continues to emphasize the theme of water that runs throughout the album and features veteran sax player James Spaulding. Porter contributed the lyrics to &quot;Wisdom&quot;, the melody of which was written by one of his mentors, Daniel Jackson. Spaulding's saxophone lends a haunting air to the song, which, Porter says in retrospect could very well be about post-Katrina New Orleans. Emphasizing his gospel roots with lyrics that echo the traditional biblical song \"Wade in the Water,\" Porter metaphorically positions water as an impediment, and wisdom as the means to overcome it. Water's most overly political song is &quot;1960 What?&quot;, inspired in part by Kamau Kenyatta's stories of life in Detroit and by the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, as well as by his own experiences growing up in Los Angeles. \"I've always loved ballads, and &quot;But Beautiful&quot; is one of my favorites,\" says Porter of the standard, on which his vocals and Chip Crawford's piano share center stage. The mournful &quot;Lonely One&quot; paints a lyrical picture of a tragic love story, while the album&#x27;s title track, &quot;Water&quot;, reiterates the artist's use of water as metaphor for redemption, cleansing, history and survival. Water's coda is a raw yet soulful Mahalia Jackson-influenced a cappella version of the classic &quot;Feeling Good&quot;. In the short fifteen months since Gregory Porter exploded onto the international music scene with his debut album, Water, he has racked up a continuing stream of accolades and awards. Porter's Water garnered a 'Best Jazz Vocal ' Grammy(r) nomination (a rare feat for a debut recording), rocketed to #1 on both iTunes and Amazon in the UK, made significant sales inroads and has soared on to be included on an international array of year-end 'Best Of' lists for 2010 in several genres. The happy result is that, in less than a year and a half, these successes have created a formidable draw for Porter as an international touring artist. Porter's ascending star is viewed most brightly in Europe, especially in the UK, where he has performed on Jamie Cullum's BBC radio program, on Later with Jools Holland, as a featured guest at the London Jazz Festival and as one of two special guests on Carole King's 2011 BBC holiday television special. UK's Jazz Wise magazine named Water the #1 Jazz Album of 2011 (the first time a vocal album has achieved this distinction. ). Meanwhile, across the channel in France and Belgium press and radio have showered Porter with incredible accolades, lauding him as the new \"Roi of Vocal Jazz,\" in both jazz and mainstream press outlets such as L'Express. \" As his international reputation continues to grow, &quot;Be Good&quot;, the title track from Porter's sophomore album, was released as an advance single to herald the much-anticipated release. On Porter&#x27;s sophomore album, Be Good, which was released on February 14, 2012 on Motema), Porter has crafted a work that not only meets, but is likely to surpass, the heightened expectations of the jazz and soul audiences eagerly awaiting his follow up to Water. Featuring Porter's winning combination of \"outstanding original songs, erudite lyrics and social comment, top drawer musicianship and improvisation, and a voice to die for\" (Jazz Wise), Be Good is a musical compendium of groove-driven delights, ranging from quiet ballads to up-tempo burners, from romantic charmers to powerful, blues-tinged anthems. Be Good finds Porter surrounded by the core of his powerhouse working band, with whom he recorded his Grammy nominated debut, and who have performed with him for over three years now: Chip Crawford on piano, Aaron James on bass, Emanuel Harrold on drums, and Yosuke Sato on alto sax. Under the sure hand of producer Brian Bacchus, Porter and the band rise to new heights on Be Good, which is further fueled by richly emotional horn arrangements by Kamau Kenyatta, who produced Water and who continues to play an important role in Porter's sound. Kenyatta also performs on one track (&quot;Painted on Canvas&quot;) and guest instrumentalists Keyon Harrold on trumpet and Tivon Pennicott on tenor sax are also featured throughout. Porter tapped the prodigious talents of veteran producer Brian Bacchus for Be Good. Bacchus, whose A&amp;R successes have included Norah Jones&#x27; Grammy-winning Come Away with Me, as well as Cassandra Wilson, Gonzo Rubalcaba, The Wild Magnolias, and Joe Lovano&#x27;s tribute to opera legend Enrico Caruso, Via Caruso, has produced projects for acclaimed jazz artists including Randy Weston, Lizz Wright, Richie Havens, Ronny Jordan, and Patricia Barber. Bachus first met Porter through a mutual friend and the two immediately recognized a shared sensibility, a sense of musical camaraderie that resulted in a strong in-studio collaboration. &quot;Gregory is the real deal and a revelation in terms of new male jazz singers, but I think that his voice coupled with his songwriting may be the thing that leaves most listeners with their mouths open,\" says Bacchus. \"There have been many solid singer songwriters coming from under the jazz umbrella of the last 10 years that are mostly brimming with folk and country influences. Gregory is the first that I'm hearing that is squarely coming out of a real classic soul bag (i. e. Bill Withers, Curtis Mayfield, Donny Hathaway) as a songwriter, but with both feet firmly planted in jazz's soil. \" A disarmingly sincere performer, with a groove that never quits, a voice of incredible virtuosity and a seemingly universal appeal as a songwriter, Porter's lyrics often speak as dreams do, in the languages of image and emotion, communicating thoroughly though not always directly. His objective as a songwriter, he says, is \"to create a sincere message about my feelings on love, culture, family and our human joys and pain. \" Even in conversation he leans toward the poetic: \"Just like the song 'Painted on Canvas' says, 'I'm 'made of the pigment of paint that is put upon' . . . trying to be honest and organic in my colors that I show. \" Be Good clearly attains that goal, and also proves to have a wide palette of colors to show. The album Be Good&#x27;s opening track, the song mentioned above, masterfully primes the canvas of Porter's sophomore release. Gentle as a bedtime story-teller, his vocals weave seamlessly in and around the warm tones established by his core band, enhanced by the sparkling threads of Kamau Kenyatta's tenor sax and Chip Crawford's impressionistic pianism. &quot;Be Good (Lion&#x27;s Song)&quot; (the leading single from the album) has been a favorite at Porter's live shows for some time, here finally making its much anticipated recording debut. The upbeat tribute \"On My Way to Harlem\" percolates with the vibrant cultural energy of the Harlem renaissance figures that once walked the streets near St. Nick's Pub, where Porter's working band came together and where he finally solidified his conviction to record his first record in 2010. \"I grew up in California and now I live in Brooklyn,\" explains Porter, \"but even so, I feel that the spirit of the artists that came out of Harlem - from Duke Ellington to Langston Hughes - has so influenced my work that Harlem is as much a part of me as if I had lived there. \" The soulful spirit of the '70s, epitomized by such artists as Lou Rawls and the Chi Lights, echoes forth in style on Porter's &quot;Real Good Hands&quot;, a track that makes it clear that Porter is a complete romantic at heart. On the intriguing ballad, &quot;The Way You Want to Live&quot;, a song of dangerous personal choices that he dedicated to Amy Winehouse during a performance at the Blue Note in New York just days after her untimely death, Chip Crawford's poignant touch on the keyboards is matched by Porter's fervent delivery. Next up, the band's unassuming, solid rapport underscores the tenderness of Porter's lyrics on &quot;When Did You Learn?&quot;. &quot;Imitation of Life&quot;, the first of the three tracks on Be Good not written by Porter, is the title track from an Oscar-nominated 1959 film starring Lana Turner and Sandra Dee. Written by Paul Francis Webster and Sammy Fain, who also penned the Academy Award-winning \"Love Is a Many Splendored Thing,\" and the Johnny Mathis hit, \"A Certain Smile, \"Imitation of Life\" was originally performed by Earl Grant and has seldom since been recorded. Porter, the youngest of a family of six raised in Bakersfield California by a single mother who was also a minister, offers a show stopping and inspiringly heartfelt tribute to this clearly exceptionally woman in &quot;Mother&#x27;s Song&quot;, emphasizing the extraordinary impact her love and fortitude has upon his life and work. \"Our Love\" which takes as its theme romantic love that succeeds despite the odds and in spite of naysayers, sustains the albums's mellow mood until Porter shakes things up completely with the scat-inflected, high energy &quot;Bling Bling&quot;. Next, Porter delivers perhaps one of the hottest and grittiest versions ever of Nat Adderly&#x27;s classic, &quot;Work Song&quot;, a hard driving blues and jazz standard that has been recorded by vocalists as disparate as Nina Simone, Bobby Darin, Sammy Davis Jr. , and Johnny Rivers. Porter closes the proceedings with an a cappella version of &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, that is as understated as a prayer and as comforting as a lullaby. ", "Little Dr n": "", "The Knife": "There are multiple artists with the name The Knife : 1) Electronic duo from Stockholm, Sweden. 2) Spanish symphonic prog band 1) The Knife was an electronic duo from Stockholm, Sweden formed in 1999. The band consisted of siblings Karin Dreijer Andersson (formerly of Honey is Cool, now Fever Ray) and Olof Dreijer - who also run their own record company, Rabid Records. The group rarely made public appearances, most of their promotional photos featured the members wearing masks, and formerly refused to perform live concerts. However the group has showed themselves in public wearing masks formed as bird&#x27;s beaks, similar to those used by medieval doctors. The Knife won a Swedish Grammy award for best pop group of the year 2003, but they boycotted the ceremony by sending two representatives of another artist group dressed as gorillas with the number 50 written on their costumes, apparently as a protest against male dominance within the music industry. Their album Deep Cuts was also nominated for a Swedish Grammy as the best record of the year 2003, although that award went to The Cardigans. It was also in 2003 that the The Knife was featured as Artist of the Week at HitQuarters, which helped them gain greater attention in the worldwide music community. The group became prominent in late 2005 when Jose Gonzalez covered &quot;Heartbeats&quot; on his 2003 album, Veneer. The song was used by Sony in a commercial for Bravia television sets, and released as a single in early 2006. The group commented on this in a Dagens Nyheter article, claiming that Sony paid a large sum of money to use the song. In view of the group&#x27;s left-wing views and non-commercial philosophy, they excused this transaction on the basis that the money was needed to establish their record company. The Knife&#x27;s song &quot;We Share Our Mothers&#x27; Health&quot; from their album Silent Shout was featured by the iTunes store as a free song of the week in late 2006. This song was also featured in the ABC series Ugly Betty, as well as an episode of CSI: NY. In February 2005, the Knife performed their first ever live show at London&#x27;s ICA, appearing with Rex the Dog and playing in front of a video created for the event by artist/film maker Andreas Nilsson. With this one live performance The Knife embarked on a major tour in 2006, and after selling out shows worldwide, a DVD of the tour was announced. The DVD was released in Sweden on November 8, 2006, and is titled Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience. Silent Shout was named the best album of 2006 by Pitchfork Media. At the Swedish Grammy awards in January 2007, The Knife won in all six categories they were nominated in: Composer of the Year, Music DVD of the Year, Producer of the Year, Pop Group of the Year, Album of the Year and Artist of the Year. Again, they did not attend the award ceremony. In 2009 the duo wrote the opera Tomorrow, In a Year, celebrating 150 years since Darwin&#x27;s Origin of Species was published. In April 2013 they released the album Shaking The Habitual. In 2014 Karin Dreijer revealed in a interview that the Knife are calling it quits for good. &quot;When we finish the tour now in November we will close down, it's our last tour,&quot; she said. &quot;We don't have any obligations to continue, it should only and always be for fun. &quot; Sites: YouTube , Deezer , Wikipedia , Discogs , SoundCloud and TheKnife. net (official). 2) The Knife is a Spanish symphonic prog band, formed in 2001. Discograpgy: http://rateyourmusic. com/artist/the_knife_f1", "Tame Impala": "Tame Impala is a psychedelic rock band from Perth, Australia. It is the project of Kevin Parker who writes and records almost all of the music by himself. The live band consists of Kevin Parker (lead guitar and vocals), Dominic Simper (guitar and synth), Jay Watson (synth and backing vocals), Julien Barbagallo (drums), Nick Allbrook (ex-bassist) who decided to leave the band mid 2013 and is now being replaced by their close friend, Cam Avery (from POND). Their name refers to the impala, a medium sized antelope. Their musical sound draws from a wide range of influences (most notably &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s psychedelic rock) and they like to see themselves as &quot;a steady flowing psychedelic groove rock band that emphasizes dream-like melody. &quot; The band signed a worldwide deal with label Modular Recordings in mid 2008, releasing their self titled EP in late 2008 and the single &#x27;Sundown Syndrome&#x27; in 2009. Their debut album, &quot;Innerspeaker&quot;, was released in 2010 to widespread critical acclaim. Their sophomore, &quot;Lonerism&quot;, was released on October 5th, 2012, again to wide acclaim. Their third album, &quot;Currents&quot;, followed in the summer of 2015. ", "The Fray": "From the sleepy sprawl of America&#x27;s &#x27;Mile-High City&#x27;, Denver, Colorado, United States, comes The Fray , a foursome whose melodic piano rock songs and soaring vocals resonate with sprawling tapestries and tales of hopefulness and heartache. Formed in 2002 by Isaac Slade (vocals, piano) and Joe King (guitar, vocals), The Fray earned a loyal grassroots following through impressive area gigs and the support of local radio, which led a listener-driven campaign to get the band a record contract. With strong word-of-mouth, the band won &quot;Best New Band&quot; honors from Denver&#x27;s Westword Magazine and garnered substantial airplay on two of Denver&#x27;s top rock stations. Specifically, he demo version of &quot;Over My Head (Cable Car)&quot; became KTCL&#x27;s top 30 most played song of 2004 in just four months. The band signed to Epic Records in 2004 and released their debut album, titled &#x27; How To Save A Life &#x27;, in September 2005. The band&#x27;s roots come from when Joe King&#x27;s band, Fancy&#x27;s show box, and Isaac Slade&#x27;s band, Ember, broke up. &quot;Three years ago, I thought I wanted to start a real estate company,&quot; laughs co-founder King. A serendipitous encounter with former schoolmate Slade at a local music store began an impromptu jam session that began an impromptu songwriting session that began The Fray. It wasn&#x27;t your usual rock n&#x27; roll lineup - vocals, guitar and piano - but it worked. The uplifting, melody-driven songs were catchy enough to attract two former band-mates of Slade&#x27;s - drummer Ben Wysocki and guitarist Dave Welsh. &quot;Ben and I were basically a package deal at the time,&quot; explains Welsh. &quot;Ben joined first, but I think he felt lonely without me. &quot; It didn&#x27;t hurt that the boys were all consummate musicians. A pianist from an early age, King competed in the local recital circuit before dropping piano altogether and picking up the guitar in junior high. &quot;The coolest guys in my eighth grade class all played guitar,&quot; confides King. &quot;I wanted to fit in. &quot; Slade began singing when he was eight, but temporary voice problems led him to discover the piano at age 11. After regaining his vocal abilities a year later, he continued studying piano and learned guitar in high school. &quot;I wrote my first song at 16,&quot; explains Slade, &quot;which is when I first picked up the guitar. &quot; Wysocki began taking drum lessons in the sixth grade, but only after having endured piano lessons at his parents&#x27; request. Welsh grew up in a musical household, and struggled with piano and saxophone before settling on guitar at age 12. The lineup secure, all the band needed was a name. Jokes about the boys&#x27; tendency to battle it out over song composition led to the suggestion of &quot;The Fray,&quot; and the name stuck. So did The Fray&#x27;s style - a sophisticated, emotional blend of tinkling pianos, acoustic and electric guitars, and gently insistent rhythms that serves as an ideal backdrop for Slade&#x27;s pitch-perfect, slurred yet achingly beautiful vocals. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Over My Head (Cable Car)&quot;, echoes the poignant lyricism of Counting Crows and the melodic intensity of U2. The title track, &quot;How To Save A Life&quot;, is a heartbreaking meditation on salvation inspired by Slade&#x27;s experience as a mentor to a crack-addicted teen. Both songs employ an epic sweep, speeding up and slowing down so effortlessly that the listener can&#x27;t help but become emotionally involved by the time the crescendo hits. Considering the quality of songwriting involved, the band&#x27;s rise to local prominence within the span of a year doesn&#x27;t seem so implausible. In January of 2004 The Fray were no-namers trying to find gigs. By December, they were getting radio pick-up and playing sold-out shows at 500-capacity venues. With a series of U. S. tour dates supporting legendary geek rockers Weezer in July 2005, The Fray made even more new fans by the time &quot;How To Save A Life&quot; dropped in September 2005. In a recent episode of &quot;Scrubs&quot; called &quot;My Lunch&quot;, the song &quot;How To Save A Life&quot; featured in the final scene where things start going wrong for Dr. Cox. The song &quot;How To Save A Life&quot; speaks about Isaac Slade&#x27;s story about helping a trouble teen that was exposed to drugs. &quot;Over My Head (Cable Car)&quot;, originally just called &quot;Cable Car&quot;, speaks about the conflict between Isaac Slade and older brother/ former band mate Caleb. They fired Caleb from the band and thus their brotherly relationship began to stir, and Over My Head was written. &quot;Look After You&quot; was written for Isaac Slade&#x27;s wife. &quot;Little House&quot; was written about a person who cut themselves. The band&#x27;s second studio album, a self-titled work, was released on February 3, 2009. Receiving considerable commercial success, &#x27; The Fray &#x27; spawned off the popular single &quot;You Found Me&quot;, a powerful, emotional track that appealed to many fans. &quot;Heartbeat,&quot; the first single from The Fray&#x27;s third album &#x27; Scars and Stories &#x27; was premiered by the band while opening for U2 on their U2 360deg Tour in May 2011. It was released for airplay on October 8, 2011, and made available for download October 11, 2011. The song was inspired by Slade&#x27;s experiences whilst traveling in Africa and also achieved notable success. &#x27; Scars and Stories &#x27; itself was released on February 7, 2012.

A British piano musical comedy duo 3. The original name of Kyuss 1) A folk group from Oslo, Norway. Mixing a variety of musical styles with multi-instrumentalism, the band consists of Anne Marit Bergheim, Solveig Heilo, Marianne Sveen and Turid Jorgensen. Most of their material is written by their friend Mats Rybo; however, the band also contribute songs written by themselves. The band is easily recognizable by their signature custom Balalaika bass with the face of a cat painted on it, echoing the true meaning of the band&#x27;s name: &quot;Katzenjammer&quot; is a German word for &quot;cat&#x27;s wail&quot; (and also a dated term for &quot;hangover. &quot;) Katzenjammer was formed by the four girls in 2005. They came to prominence NRK&#x27;s &quot;Urort&quot; project; a platform for up-and-coming bands and artists to showcase their material and win national exposure. They were also contestants on &quot;Kjempesjansen&quot;, a Norwegian talent show. With their unique sound and exceptional live shows, Katzenjammer slowly but surely gained a reputation as an act to watch. In 2007, they held a concert at Norwegian Wood, a famous Norwegian music festival, as part of their Underwood line-up. The band eventually scored an underground hit with &quot;A Bar in Amsterdam&quot; and made it as far as the finals in Urort&#x27;s &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; awards. Early in 2008, Katzenjammer served as support acts for various other Norwegian bands including Kaizers Orchestra, who had openly supported the band. Throughout their career, they have often been referred to by the media as a female Kaizers Orchestra, as both bands are famous for their eclectic musical style and energetic live shows. They also made several TV appearances. In October of that year, they released their first studio album, Le Pop . The album received many good reviews and the subsequent tour helped build a fanbase. The album was released in international markets with an altered tracklist in 2009. Their second studio album, A Kiss Before You Go , is scheduled for official release on 9 September 2011. In anticipation of the album, the singles &quot;When the Laughter&#x27;s Gone&quot; and &quot;I Will Dance (When I Walk Away)&quot; were released earlier that year. . 2) A British piano musical comedy duo, since summer 2003, comprising two Royal College of Music graduates: Steven Worbey &amp; Kevin Farrell.

They compose lengthy, mostly instrumental guitar-based pieces in the style of post-rock, usually focused around the elaboration of a single theme, and are known traditionally for their quiet/loud dynamic, defined bass riffs, and an eminent ambient sound, sometimes dark and sometimes grand. Although frequently referred to as post-rock, the band have revealed in interviews that they despise this categorization, insisting that their sound bears little resemblance to pioneers of the genre, such as Tortoise. The band were originally signed to renowned Glasgow indie label Chemikal Underground , but call a number of labels home, being distributed by different labels such as Matador in the United States and Play it again Sam Records in the United Kingdom. They have also developed their own label called Rock Action Records , named after guitarist Ron Asheton of The Stooges, who had his name changed to Rock Action. Mogwai are named after the creatures from the film Gremlins (the word itself is Cantonese for &#x27;ghost&#x27; or &#x27;hunter&#x27; dependant on the semi or literal translation), although Braithwaite comments that &quot;it has no significant meaning and we always intended on getting a better one , but like a lot of other things we never got round to it. &quot;. Their style has been influenced by such bands as The Cure, Joy Division, The Jesus &amp; Mary Chain, Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, and post-rock granddaddies Slint. During 2004 the band were handed support slots on the tours of two of their heroes, the Pixies and The Cure. It has easily identifiable connections to genres like shoegaze, math rock, art rock, and occasionally instrumental metal. While Mogwai&#x27;s sound bears little resemblance to punk rock, the band seems to identify closely with the punk ethic. Mogwai&#x27;s influence on the indie rock scene can be heard in the work of Explosions in the Sky, Italians Giardini di Miro, Qatsi, and most other contemporary post-rock. The fifth Mogwai album, Mr. Beast, was released in March 2006 and returned to the heavier sounds of 1997&#x27;s Mogwai Young Team. Mr. Beast saw Mogwai dropping most of their &quot;post-rock&quot; crescendoing with songs developing more like rock, with direct hooks and lyrics. Mogwai produced the remix track of &#x27;Plans&#x27; on the British group Bloc Party&#x27;s 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed. In October 2006 Mogwai returned with a soundtrack to the documentary of global football star Zinedine Zidane called Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait, released through their own label Rock Action. They have also released a soundtrack to Darren Aronofsky&#x27;s &#x27;The Fountain&#x27; in collaboration with Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet. The Hawk is Howling was released in September 2008. In February 2011 the band released their 7th Studio Album Hardcore Will Never Die, But You Will. And, in July 2013, Mogwai performed their soundtrack to Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait for the first time at a number of dates across the UK. Shortly afterwards, on 5 August, the band revealed via Twitter that they were recording a new studio album at Castle of Doom Studios, expected to be released in early 2014.

A CalArts graduate, she released her first studio album, Tragedy, in 2011. A second album, Ekstasis, followed in 2012. Holter also collaborates with other musicians including Nite Jewel, Linda Perhacs, and Michael Pisaro. In 2013, she released her third album, Loud City Song to resounding critical acclaim. Holter, a Los Angeles native, grew up in a musical family. Her father plays guitar and once performed with Pete Seeger. Her mother, Carole Shammas, is a prominent academic and currently holds the John R. Hubbard Chair in History at the University of Southern California. Besides playing and recording music, Holter tutors students and works with a nonprofit organization for teenagers in South Central Los Angeles. After graduating from CalArts, where she studied composition, Holter contributed songs to multiple compilation albums in 2008. She performed in the LA Road Concert with the Open Academy Youth Orchestra on Washington Boulevard in 2009. The following year she began playing with Linda Perhacs&#x27; band. In 2010, she released a CD-R titled Celebration and a collection of live recordings. Her debut studio album, Tragedy, was released in August 2011 on Leaving Records. Inspired by Euripides&#x27; Greek play Hippolytus, the album received generally favorable reviews and was named one of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Best Outer Sound Albums Of 2011&quot;. Holter released a second album, Ekstasis, in March 2012 on the RVNG label. The album drew comparisons to works by such artists as Laurie Anderson, Julianna Barwick, Kate Bush, Joanna Newsom, Grouper, and Stereolab, and received many positive reviews. Holter spent three years making the album, whose title comes from the Greek word meaning &quot;outside of oneself. &quot; The music video for album track &quot;Moni Mon Amie&quot;, directed by Yelena Zhelezov, was also released in March. In addition to collaborating with other California-based musicians like Nite Jewel (Ramona Gonzalez), Holter recently released her third album, Loud City Song. Unlike her first two albums, which were recorded mostly alone in her bedroom, Holter recorded Loud City Song with an ensemble of musicians", "Caribou": "Caribou is Canadian Dan Snaith (b. 1978), who formerly recorded under the moniker Manitoba. Known for altering his sound with each subsequent release, he incorporates electronic psychedelia, krautrock rhythms, and breakbeat drums and creates a swirling, lush, musical panorama. Snaith also creates more club-oriented dance music under the name Daphni. Snaith grew up in Dundas, Ontario, Canada, which gave its name to a song from his debut album Start Breaking My Heart. He studied at the University of Toronto as an undergrad, but was based in the UK for several years until he completed his Ph. D. in mathematics at the Imperial College, London in 2005. Snaith previously recorded under the stage name &quot;Manitoba&quot;, but changed it under threat of a lawsuit by Handsome &quot;Dick&quot; Manitoba, frontman for The Dictators, a punk-rocker with an appetite for litigation. Uninterested in the legal stoush, Snaith is quoted saying that he chose the new moniker &quot;Caribou&quot; while on an LSD trip with friends in the Canadian wilderness. He then climbed a tree and didn&#x27;t come down until he finished his first album under the new moniker, which was four months later. He has recorded five full lengths: Start Breaking My Heart, a jazzy, &quot;folktronica&quot; IDM album, Up in Flames, the critically acclaimed shoegazer with analog synths and sometimes live, sometimes sampled drums, The Milk of Human Kindness, his krautrock-inspired album that bleeds 70&#x27;s prog and 70&#x27;s drugscapes, the psychedelic pop record, Andorra which landed him the prestigious 2008 Polaris Music Prize on September 29th, 2008 and Swim a disco / dance inspired album created from the idea of making dance music that sounds like being under water. A few years prior to the recording of the album, Snaith&#x27;s wife gave him swimming lessons as a Christmas present, prompting him to take it up as a new hobby. This partially led to the eventual ideology behind Swim. His eclectic live performances are renowned, in part for their use of simultaneous drummers and synchronised visuals. The live band currently consists of Dan Snaith (guitar, keyboards, vocals, drums, flutophone), Ryan Smith (guitar, keyboards), Brad Weber (drums) and John Schmersal (bass, vocals). ", "Funf Sterne Deluxe": "Funf Sterne deluxe (&quot;Five Stars deluxe&quot;) from Hamburg mainly focus on entertaining rhymes and often supply innovative beats. It was a german hiphop-band with the members Das Bo, Tobi Tobsen, Marcnesium and DJ Coolmann. ", "Simple Minds": "Simple Minds is a Scottish pop and rock band that achieved its greatest worldwide popularity from the mid-80s to the early 90s, still playing to a massive fan-following today. The group, from the South Side of Glasgow, has produced a set of critically acclaimed albums in the early 80s. It also has secured a string of successful hit singles, the best known being their #1 worldwide hit single &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, from the soundtrack of the John Hughes movie The Breakfast Club and their worldwide hit single &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;. The band has sold more than 40 million albums since 1979, breaking to the U. K. Top 40 chart a full 24 times. Founding members Jim Kerr (vocals) and Charlie Burchill (guitar, keyboards), along with drummer Mel Gaynor, are the core of the band. It also currently features Andy Gillespie on keyboards and Ged Grimes on bass guitar. Formed in late 1977 from the ashes of punk rock group Johnny &amp; the Self Abusers (which had only created one single), Simple Minds initially signed to Arista, who recorded and released their first three albums. As the the Self-Abusers, they had had a very raw and unpolished sound, playing their first gig in a Glasgow bar on Easter Monday in 1977. \"When we were onstage it was mayhem,\" Kerr later said. \"No one could play a note. It was just white noise&#8230; took us about six months to become serious about it. \" The musical changes Simple Minds went through in these first three albums shows how diverse their song range is. Tracks to compare would be &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, their first single with hints of Johnny and the Self Abusers that was inspired by Andy Warhol&#x27;s pop art, and &quot;I Travel&quot;, an almost disco sounding track, with &quot;Someone&quot;, a loose yet energetic rock track that could have fit alongside the power pop bands at the Top of the Pops. The group grew major influence from the glam rock and post-punk ethos around them, particularly from the band&#x27;s hero David Bowie. Virgin Records saw the potential in the band and in 1981 signed them up. The first Virgin Records release, Sons And Fascination/Sister Feelings Call , was a double album. Yet it was later released as two single albums: Sons and Fascination and Sister Feelings Call . Their fan-base in the U. K. grew, but they couldn&#x27;t quite break into the mainstream yet. In September 1981, founding drummer Brian McGee left the band, to be replaced by Gaynor . They first found notable success with New Gold Dream (81-82-83-84) , which is still regarded as their best album by some fans. Moving into a more melodic rock sound, Billboard magazine later called the release &quot;a creative peak&quot;, and the 1982 album gave Simple Minds a top three U. K. chart slot. Irish rock group U2 took major influence from the band, particularly the aforementioned album, and they became often compared as friendly rivals from about this point on. Soon afterwards, the band garnered great commercial success in Europe and their native U. K. since then (in the 80s and early 90s they sold 30 million albums worldwide). In the United States, however, they had a hard time reaching the popular pop audience. They finally smashed into the States with &quot;Don&#x27;t You (Forget About Me)&quot;, a new wave gem that was used in the soundtrack to the John Hughes coming-of-age film The Breakfast Club and went to number one. Ironically it is one of few songs recorded by the band that they didn&#x27;t write themselves. Producer and composer Keith Forsey was such a devoted fan of the band and so fixated on the notion of them recording his tune that he flew to London to persuade them to do so, with them acceding mostly based on their budding personal friendship with Foresey. In 1985, the arena rock fueled album Once Upon a Time yielded a string of worldwide hit singles such as &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot;, &quot;Sanctify Yourself&quot;, and &quot;Ghostdancing&quot; All this ead to playing bigger arenas and supporting Amnesty International with donations from record sales. &quot;Alive and Kicking&quot; in particular became something of a signature song of the band, it reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U. S. and garnered airplay all over Europe Still, the pressures of touring and recording took their toll. Frontman Kerr later remarked, &quot;Looking back now, at the end of the &#x27;80s, one of the things we didn't have was endless energy. That was 13 years of nonstop recording, writing, rehearsing, touring. The wheels were staring to come off&quot;. Though the popularity of the band waned, with personnel changes leading to fan division, they kept on with their arena-ready sound and managed sporadic chart success. Critical reviews also favored the band. Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchill remain the core of the band to this day, with Andy Gillespie (keyboards), Mel Gaynor (drums) and Eddie Duffy (bass) supporting. Other members of the band are Michael MacNeil (keyboards), Derek Forbes (Bass), and John Giblin (Bass). They have maintained a strong fan-base world-wide, and their somewhat more recent album Black and White 050505 received critical acclaim on its release in September 2005, although it did not secure a release in the U. S. The band embarked on a U. K. -wide arena tour towards the end of 2008 to celebrate 30 years as a band. This was considered a great success. Their latest studio album, Graffiti Soul , was released on 25 May 2009. With praise appearing in publications such as Mojo magazine and the All Music Guide, the release became something of a comeback album, with it reaching the top 40 album charts in several nations. Fans also acclaimed the work. Group frontman Jim Kerr is notable outside of the music arena today for his opening of a Hotel Villa Angela in Taormina, Sicily and his public support for the Celtic FC football team. He also was famously married to rock star Chrissie Hynde of the Pretenders in 1984 (divorced 1992). They have one child, Yasmin Paris Kerr (1985). He was subsequently married to actress Patsy Kensit in 1992 (divorced, 1996) with whom he had a son, James Kerr (born, 1993).

In 2007, John won 2 Grammys, one for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, for the song &quot;Waiting On The World To Change,&quot; and also Best Pop Vocal Album for his album Continuum.

In 2004, Mayer worked with hip hop artist and producer Kanye West, appearing both on Go and Kanye West&#x27;s Bittersweet (released in the summer of 2007 as an iTunes pre-order bonus track to the album Graduation ) and received praise from rap heavyweights like Jay-Z and Nelly. When asked about his ubiquitous presence in the hip hop community, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s not music out there right now. That&#x27;s why, to me, hip-hop is where rock used to be. &quot; It was around this time that he began hinting at a change in his musical interests, announcing that he was &quot;closing up shop on acoustic sensitivity. &quot; In 2005, he began a string of collaborations with various blues artists, including Buddy Guy, BB King, Eric Clapton and jazz artist John Scofield. He also toured with the legendary jazz pianist Herbie Hancock, which included a show at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee.

In September 2006, Mayer released his third studio album, Continuum .

He was born into an Anglo-Indian family and, after studying with Phillipe Sandre in Calcutta and Melhi Mehta in Bombay, he won a scholarship to London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music in 1952, where he studied comparative music and religion in eastern and western cultures.

After signing a record deal with Capitol Records, she pursued a successful solo career. Her solo debut album, LeToya (2006), topped the US Billboard 200 albums chart in July 2006 and was certified platinum by the RIAA in December 2006. The single, &quot;Torn&quot;, achieved records on BET&#x27;s top ten countdown show 106 &amp; Park. She was also named &quot;One of the Best New Artists of 2006&quot; by AOL and the &quot;Top Songwriter of 2006&quot; by ASCAP. Luckett released a second solo album Lady Love on August 25th, 2009 which debuted at #12 on the U. S. Billboard 200 chart and #1 on the U. S. Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Letoya Luckett was born in Houston, Texas to parents of African American and Indigenous American descent and grew up singing in her local Brentwood Baptist Church. She also had vocal lessons to become an opera singer. Her father, who was also a singer, was very proud of his daughter&#x27;s vocal talents and tried to promote her in the music business. Luckett is the eldest of two children; she has a younger brother Gavin. Luckett was given the opportunity to sing her first church solo at the age of five. &quot;The lady just gave me the mic one Sunday and I sang&quot;, she recalled. Shortly thereafter, she joined the children&#x27;s choir and began performing in plays at her elementary school. One day, she walked to her desk in class to find a girl sitting in her seat. Luckett asked her teacher to remove the girl from her assigned seat, who turned out to be Beyonce Knowles. They later became friends, and she was invited to join Latavia&#x27;s and Beyonce&#x27;s singing group. In 1993, LeToya Luckett joined Beyonce Knowles, LaTavia Roberson, and Kelly Rowland to complete the Houston-based R&amp;B group, Destiny&#x27;s Child. After being signed and later dropped by Elektra Records, the group eventually signed with Columbia Records in 1997, but not before signing with Mathew Knowles as their official manager. According to the E! Television Special, Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Knowles forced the girls to sign with him before they could sign with the label. LeToya&#x27;s mother requested the contracts be reviewed by an attorney, but Knowles denied the request. However, Luckett eventually signed with him and joined the group. After graduating from the Houston club scene, the group began opening for acts such as Dru Hill, SWV, and Immature, and released their 1998 self-titled debut album Destiny&#x27;s Child. The album spawned two singles: the platinum &quot;No, No, No Part II&quot; (featuring Wyclef Jean) and &quot;With Me&quot;. The group was featured on the Why Do Fools Fall in Love soundtrack with the song &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; (featuring Timbaland), and later toured as an opening act on TLC&#x27;s &quot;Fanmail Tour&quot; and Christina Aguilera&#x27;s debut tour. In 1999, the group released their second album, The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall. The album became one of the biggest selling albums released by a female group, and was certified eight times platinum in the USA. The album spawned four hit singles: &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot;, &quot;Bug a Boo&quot;, &quot;Say My Name&quot; and &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jumpin&#x27;&quot;. In late 1999, in the midst of the group&#x27;s rising success, Luckett and Roberson sent a letter to their management stating they wanted their own manager because of the increasing lack of communication from the group&#x27;s manager Mathew Knowles (who is also Beyonce Knowles&#x27; father). The pair said they never wanted to fire Knowles, but they did want to secure outside management to represent them fairly. Soon after, Luckett and Roberson found themselves on the outs with Knowles family and the group they helped create. When the &quot;Say My Name&quot; music video debuted in February 2000, they were shocked to find themselves replaced by two new members, Michelle Williams and Farrah Franklin. Luckett and Roberson filed a lawsuit against Matthew Knowles, Beyonce Knowles and Kelly Rowland, charging them with breach of partnership and fiduciary duties, and sought unspecified damages. Luckett and Roberson withdrew the case against Beyonce and Kelly, but continued to sue Matthew Knowles. The case was eventually settled, with Luckett and Roberson continuing to receive royalties from their contributions as founding members of the group. When it seemed as if the drama had subsided, shortly following the release of Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s Survivor, Luckett and Roberson filed another lawsuit against the group in March 2002. They claimed that the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Survivor&quot;, violated their previous settlement due to its lyrics, which they believed to reference the ugly split. After several months of media speculation, it was announced via the MTV News website that Luckett and Roberson had created a new group called Anjel. After several auditions, Naty Quinones and Tiffany Beaudoin were selected as members. The group recorded a twenty-two-song demo in Atlanta, Georgia, with the help of R&amp;B group Jagged Edge. Their production company (581 Entertainment) which handled the group fell through, and all the members of Anjel went on to pursue solo projects. However, the recorded tracks were leaked onto the internet. After the Anjel project fell through, Luckett joined with Noontime, an Atlanta-based management/production company. Along with Noontime, she recorded a five song demo and eventually signed with Capitol Records in 2003. Soon after, she began working on her debut solo album. The first promotional single, &quot;You Got What I Need&quot;, was released in 2004, followed next year by &quot;All Eyes on Me&quot;. She featured on &quot;My Promise&quot; with her label mate Houston on his debut album It&#x27;s Already Written, &quot;What Love Can Do&quot; on the Coach Carter soundtrack, and on &quot;This Is My Life&quot; with former boyfriend and rapper Slim Thug on his album Already Platinum. LeToya&#x27;s self-titled debut album, was released on July 2006 and debuted at number one on the U. S. Billboard 200 and Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts, outselling the compilation Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music! and Pharrell Williams&#x27;s debut album. The album was certified gold after one month and as of December 2006, the album had been certified platinum. Luckett and Beyonce Knowles are the only members of Destiny&#x27;s Child to have an album debut at number one on the Billboard 200 and achieve platinum status in the U. S. With LeToya being marketed as &quot;The H-Town Chick&quot;, the album featured hip-hop inspired R&amp;B production. Producers on the album included Jermaine Dupri, Scott Storch, Teddy Bishop, B. Cox, and musical guests Slim Thug, Mike Jones, Paul Wall, and Bun B. &quot;All Eyes on Me&quot; was originally chosen as LeToya&#x27;s debut single, but she selected &quot;Torn&quot; instead. She stated she &quot;had to go against the grain&quot; to get that single released, but it proved to be a good move. The ballad (produced by Teddy Bishop and a personal favorite of LeToya&#x27;s) was released March 2006 and became an R&amp;B hit. The ballad has been compared to Natalie Imbruglia and Mary J. Blige&#x27;s past hit singles. The song climbed the Billboard charts, peaking at number two on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs and became the number one song on urban radio. &quot;Torn&quot; (2006) LeToya&#x27;s most successful single to date. &quot;She Don&#x27;t&quot; (2006) Although Torn was still receiving major airplay, her second single, &quot;She Don&#x27;t&quot;, was released to radio and the video premiered on BET&#x27;s Access Granted in July 2006 featuring LeToya&#x27;s ex-boyfriend, Slim Thug. The single received moderate success, reaching number seventeen on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart. In November 2006, &quot;Obvious&quot; was selected as the third single. According to Billboard, the song had a 94% chance of becoming a hit, but due to the merger of Capitol Records and Virgin Records, all promotion and money was frozen, therefore the single was never officially released. Luckett was also named &quot;One of the Best New Artists of 2006&quot; by AOL Music, number two on Rap-Up magazines&#x27; Top 5 Breakthrough Artists of 2006, and had received multiple nominations from the NAACP, the Soul Train Music Awards, and the Teen Choice Awards. BET promoted LeToya heavily not only on 106 &amp; Park, The Center, and The Black Carpet, but with a three-part reality series special called The H-Town Chick, which aired from May to July 2006. The series chronicled LeToya&#x27;s experiences during her summer promotional tour and insight on her life since Destiny&#x27;s Child. BET also hosted a contest that gave fans the opportunity to decide the final outcome of the &quot;Torn&quot; video. Cingular hosted a Lip-Sync contest that awarded those who best performed &quot;Torn&quot; best in an online submitted video. In addition to a nationwide radio tour, club performances, a brief European and Asian tour, LeToya was asked to participate in the 2006 Pantene Total You Tour, the Cingular Live in Concert series, and was personally invited by Mary J. Blige to join her summer tour, The Breakthrough Experience Tour, as her opening act. Lady Love On July 13, she said in an interview that her album will have a 1980&#x27;s influence on her songs and during the event, LeToya announced that the album would officially going to be named Lady Love, then she introduced and performed two new songs &quot;Lady Love&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Get Away&quot;. On December 10, a buzz track, Swagger, that features rappers such as Slim Thug, Killa Kyleon and Bun B leaked onto internet through Luckett&#x27;s official fansite, surprisingly the song makes a reference of Beyonce&#x27;s song, Upgrade U. In 2008 she was featured on Webbie&#x27;s single &quot;I Miss You&quot; which was a moderate success. She didn&#x27;t appear in the video due to the fact that she was acting in the nationwide play &quot;Rumors&quot; and as a result wasn&#x27;t able to make it to the shoot. LeToya&#x27;s second solo album was released on August 25, 2009. and debuted at #1 on the Billboard R&amp;B Hip Hop chart. The first single, &quot;Not Anymore&quot;, was written by Ne-Yo and was produced by Bei Maejor. It was released on February 3. The music video was released on March 10. The uptempo song &quot;She Ain&#x27;t Got&#8230;&quot; was leaked onto the internet end of March 2009 on several sites including YouTube. Luckett ran a contest online giving fans the chance to choose the follow-up single to \"Not Anymore. \" Called \"The Final Showdown,\" the contest gave the option of voting for one of two songs off her sophomore album, Lady Love. \"We want the fans to choose between 'Regret' and 'She Ain't Got Shit On Me,'\" LeToya reveals. \"So whichever one wins between those two. They'll both be singles though&quot;. &quot;She Ain&#x27;t Got&#8230;&quot; won. &quot;Regret&quot; was released soon after and became a urban hit reaching #3 on Urban Mediabase. A video was released in November and is currently on 106 And Park. The song peaked at #78 on the U. S. Billboard Hot 100 chart (becoming the first single from Lady Love to peak within this chart) and #8 on the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. LeToya revealed via Twitter that she was filming a video for Good To Me - thus confirming it to be the next single. The viral video premiered on the internet on February 12th. Luckett&#x27;s first role on television was on the WB show &quot;Smart Guy&quot; in 1998 with Destiny&#x27;s Child. She also had an appearance in the movie &quot;Beverly Hood&quot; in 1999. Since 2008, LeToya has been acting in plays and movies. LeToya was part of the cast of JD Lawrence&#x27;s stage play Rumors as the character Michelle. She hit the road from January 31, 2008 to March 2, 2008. Luckett is starring in the movie Preacher&#x27;s Kid, which was released in January 2010. She is also part of the movie Killers, scheduled for release June 4th, 2010 along with Ashton Kutcher, Katherine Heigl and Tom Selleck. ", "Kraftwerk": "Kraftwerk (&quot;power plant&quot; in English) is an electronic band founded in 1970 in Dusseldorf, Germany. They pioneered electronic music in the 70s and are considered one of the most important and influential bands of their genre, often described as &quot;the godfathers of electronic music&quot;. Kraftwerk&#x27;s sound is minimalistic and strictly electronic; it combines driving, repetitive rhythms with catchy melodies and vocals usually sung through a vocoder. The current line-up consists of Ralf Hutter (the only original member), Fritz Hilpert, Henning Schmitz and Stefan Pfaffe. The other founding member Florian Schneider left the band in 2008. Ralf Hutter (born 1946, Krefeld, Germany) and Florian Schneider (born 1947, Dusseldorf, Germany) met while they were studying improvised music in Dusseldorf, Germany. In 1967 Ralf Hutter (organ), Florian Schneider (violin, flute), Basil Hammoudi (vocals), Butch Hauf (bass) and Fred Monics (drums) formed the group Organisation, released the album Tone Float and split shortly thereafter. The album features repetitive percussion and bass drum patterns embellished with guitar, flute, violin and organ. After disbanding Organisation, Ralf Hutter and Florian Schneider adopted the name Kraftwerk. Early Kraftwerk line-ups from 1970-1974 fluctuated, as Hutter and Schneider worked with around a half-dozen other musicians, most notably Andreas Hohmann (drums; 1970), Houschang Nejadepour (guitar; 1970), Charly Weiss (drums; 1970/71), Eberhard Kranemann (cello, bass, hawaii-guitar; 1970/71), Klaus Roder (electric guitar, electronic violin; 1974), Michael Rother (guitar; 1970-71) and Klaus Dinger (drums; 1970-71). For a short period in 1970/71 Ralf Hutter left the band to complete his degree in architecture. There were some sessions/concerts with the line-up &quot;Schneider, Kranemann, Weiss&quot;, &quot;Schneider, Hohmann, Kranemann, Rother, Dinger&quot; and &quot;Schneider, Rother, Dinger&quot; in that time. In 1971 Rother and Dinger left Kraftwerk to form the band Neu!. Their first three albums were more free-form experimental rock without the pop hooks or the more disciplined strong structure of its later work. Their debut album, Kraftwerk , released in 1970, and Kraftwerk 2 , released in 1972, were mostly exploratory jam music, played on a variety of traditional instruments including guitar, bass, drums, electric organ, flute and violin. Post-production modifications to these recordings were then used to distort the sound of the instruments, particularly audio-tape manipulation and multiple dubbings of one instrument on the same track. Connie Plank co-produced the first four Kraftwerk albums. Emil Schult has also collaborated on many releases, contributing both lyrics and graphics. Live performances from 1972-73 were made as a duo, using a simple beat-box-type electronic drum machine, with preset rhythms taken from an electric organ. These shows were mainly in Germany, with occasional shows in France. In 1973, Wolfgang Flur (electronic percussion) joined the group. With Ralf und Florian , released in 1973, the band began to move closer to its classic sound, relying more heavily on synthesisers and drum machines. Although almost entirely instrumental, the album marks Kraftwerk&#x27;s first use of the vocoder, which would, in time, become one of its musical signatures. In 1974, they issued the fourth studio album, Autobahn . This critically acclaimed album marked Kraftwerk&#x27;s breakthrough and established them as purveyors of electronic music. The title track is intended to capture the feeling of driving on the Autobahn: from travelling through the landscape, the high-speed concentration on the fast lane, to tuning the car radio and the monotony of a long trip. An edited version of &quot;Autobahn&quot; song reached #25 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart and #11 in the UK. In 1975, Karl Bartos (electronic percussion, live vibraphone, live keyboards) joined the band. The Hutter-Schneider-Bartos-Flur formation is now regarded as the classic line-up of Kraftwerk, which remained in place until the late 80s. In 1975, Kraftwerk released the concept album Radio-Activity (German version: Radio-Aktivitat ). The hyphenated album title displays Kraftwerk&#x27;s typical deadpan humour, being a pun on the twin themes of the songs, half being about radioactivity and the other half about activity on the radio. The title track &quot;Radioactivity&quot; was released as a single, and became a hit in France after it was used as the theme to a popular music show. This was the first Kraftwerk album to be entirely self-produced by Hutter &amp; Schneider in their Kling Klang studio, and the first one to be performed by the classic line-up of Kraftwerk. In 1977, Kraftwerk released the highly influential album, Trans-Europe Express . Critics have described the album as having two specific themes: celebration of Europe and the disparities between reality and image. Musically, the songs on this album differ from the group&#x27;s earlier Krautrock style with a focus on electronic mechanized rhythms, minimalism, and occasional manipulated vocals. Two singles supported the album: &quot;Trans-Europe Express&quot; and &quot;Showroom Dummies&quot;. By the time of 1978&#x27;s The Man-Machine (German version: Die Mensch-Maschine ), Kraftwerk had created their own unmistakable brand of &quot;robot pop&quot;. NME said of The Man-Machine: &#x27;It is the only completely successful visual/aural fusion rock has produced so far&quot;. Kraftwerk spent three years building their own Kling Klang studios in the late 70s, complete with, inevitably, scores of computers. The single &quot;The Model&quot;, gave the band a surprise hit when it topped the UK charts in 1982. In 1981 Kraftwerk released their eight studio album, Computer World (German version: Computerwelt ). This album combined the use of the sequencer to create the sound now known as electro, inspiring the first producers in Detroit in creating techno, as well as innumerable other artists including Gary Numan, Depeche Mode, and New Order, among many others. This album had the theme of computers taking over the world in the future. It was a commercial success, spawning the singles &quot;Pocket Calculator&quot;, &quot;Computer World&quot; and &quot;Computer Love&quot;. For this album, the band embarked on the massive Computer World world tour. The EP Tour De France was issued in 1983. This song was featured in the film Breakdance and became the theme for the cycling event of the same name in that year. In 1986, the ninth studio album Electric Cafe was released. The album received mixed reviews. Two singles were issued from the album: &quot;Musique Non-Stop&quot; and &quot;The Telephone Call&quot;. In 1987 Wolfgang Flur departed and it was replaced by Fritz Hilpert. In 1991, Kraftwerk&#x27;s best known songs were collected together and re-recorded on the compilation The Mix . The single Expo 2000 released in December 1999 came as a surprise for Kraftwerk fans. A brand new song, although low key, sparked hopes of a new album. A video was released for this track, showing the band playing in wireframe suits, but no public appearances or interviews until 2003. In 2003 the band released Tour de France Soundtracks , its first album of new material since 1986&#x27;s Electric Cafe . The album was recorded for the 100th anniversary of the first Tour de France bicycle race, although it missed its original release date during the actual Tour. A completely new recording was made for the &quot;Tour De France&quot; track, based on the original 1983 arrangement. In June 2005, Kraftwerk released Minimum-Maximum , their first official live album. It features two CDs and tracks recorded on their world tour during 2004, including concerts in Warsaw, Moscow, Berlin, London, Budapest, Tallinn, Riga, Tokyo and San Francisco. The band also released a live DVD. Florian Schneider officially left the band in January 2009, though news of his departure was reported as early as April 2008. His place will be taken over by Stefan Pfaffe. In 2009, the band issued The Catalogue (German version: Der Katalog ), a box-set comprising eight albums by Kraftwerk that were released from 1974 to 2003. All albums were digitally remastered, with most of the cover art redesigned, including rare photographs in the liner notes that were not part of each album&#x27;s original release. Kraftwerk&#x27;s influence has been incalculable. Hundreds of artists today in nearly every electronic music subgenres bear witness to their work. They are also reclusive, rarely giving interviews and making no media appearances.

Best known for his years with the Drive-By Truckers where he played with his then wife, bassist Shonna Tucker. Isbell - who joined the Truckers in 2001 - left the band in early 2007 around the same time as his divorce from Tucker was finalized. In addition to being a gifted songwriter, Isbell is regarded as an exceptional guitar player. His style is mostly in the alt-country genre, but is also infused with rock and blues elements. One of his most well-known songs is &quot;Dress Blues,&quot; a tribute to a fallen soldier from the Iraq war. Jason Isbell&#x27;s debut solo album Sirens from the Ditch was released on July 10th, 2007, on New West Records. With his band The 400 Unit , he toured in support of this release in the US and Canada during the summer and fall of 2007. Both Isbell and the band released a follow-up album, Jason Isbell and The 400 Unit on February 17, 2009. ", "Death Grips": "Death Grips are an experimental hip hop group formed in Sacramento, California, United States in 2010. The group consists of Stefan Burnett aka Ride (vocals) and the production team Zach Hill and Andy Morin aka A2B2, often credited as Flatlander. Their live setup consisted of Burnett on vocals, Morin on keyboards, and Hill on drums. The group officially formed December 21, 2010, and released its first single and video for &quot;Full Moon (Death Classic)&quot; on March 8, 2011. On April 26, 2011, they released their debut album, the mixtape Exmilitary. NBCNewYork. com called it &quot;an intense, dark listen. &quot; On February 27, 2012 Death Grips signed with Epic and released two albums the same year. The first official album, The Money Store, was released on April 24. Music videos were made for the singles &quot;Blackjack,&quot; &quot;Get Got,&quot; and &quot;Fever (Aye Aye). &quot; The track &quot;Lost Boys&quot; was also released alone with no video accompaniment. After a month and a half long ARG involving the deep web, and a spat with Epic over its release, Death Grips leaked the album No Love Deep Web on its website on October 1st, 2012. This resulted in someone closing down the band&#x27;s website. The band said it was done by the label which the label denied shortly. On November 13, 2013, the band spontaneously made available their third LP within two years, Government Plates. The album was posted to their soundcloud page and website, much like No Love Deep Web, but without any sort of lead up or prior hype bar one single released months beforehand, taking most listeners by complete surprise. On June 8, 2014, Death Grips released the first half of a new double album featuring Bjork, The Powers That B. Disc 1 is titled Niggas on the Moon, Disc 2 will be titled Jenny Death. The full double album will be released via Harvest Records/Third Worlds in 2015.

", "Low": "Low is a slowcore band formed in Duluth, Minnesota, United States in 1993, by Alan Sparhawk (guitar and vocals), Mimi Parker (drums and vocals) and original bassist John Nichols (bass guitar). Zak Sally replaced Nichols after Low&#x27;s first album and tour. In 2005, Sally quit the band; Matt Livingston replaced him shortly thereafter. In 2008 Steve Garrington took over on bass creating the current lineup of Sparhawk, Parker and Garrington. Their music is commonly described as &quot;slowcore,&quot; a subgenre characterised by slow tempos and minimalist arrangements. They are one of the earlier bands to adopt and popularize the style, making them considerable contributors to the slowcore movement. (It is worth noting that the band dislikes this label. In an interview Alan Sparhawk says of descriptions of their music: &quot;What&#x27;s the cheesiest? Slow-core. I hate that word. The most appropriate is anything that uses the word minimal in it, but I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s made one up for that&quot;) Parker and Sparhawk&#x27;s striking vocal harmonies represent perhaps the group&#x27;s most distinctive element. History The band formed in the spring of 1993. Sparhawk had been playing in the Duluth, Minnesota, band Zen Identity. That band needed a new bassist, and Nichols was recruited. At that time, Nichols was a senior at Superior Senior High School in nearby Superior, Wisconsin, and bassist in the band Lorenzo&#x27;s Tractor. Sparhawk was called upon to teach Zen Identity songs to Nichols. During practices, the two started improvising with some very modest, quiet themes. As a joke, they wondered what would happen if they played such quiet music in front of Duluth crowds, which at that point focused around the loud, grunge, &quot;post-punk&quot; sound. Soon, the joke became a serious thought. Sparhawk disbanded Zen Identity, and he and Nichols recruited Sparhawk&#x27;s wife Mimi Parker to play a very modest drum kit composed of a single cymbal and a single floor tom. She used brushes almost exclusively. Low&#x27;s debut album, I Could Live in Hope , was released on Virgin Records&#x27; Vernon Yard imprint in 1994. It featured Nichols on bass, though he was replaced by Sally, who joined for the recording of the band&#x27;s next album Long Division . Long Division and its similar follow-up, 1996&#x27;s The Curtain Hits the Cast , established the band as critical darlings; extensive touring helped them to develop a highly devoted fan base. &quot;Over the Ocean,&quot; a single drawn from The Curtain Hits the Cast , also became something of a hit on college radio. Low experienced considerable difficulties during their tenure with Vernon Yard, and by the time of their next full-length (1999&#x27;s Secret Name ) they had moved to the influential independent label Kranky. In between, they released several singles and EPs. In 1999, Low joined forces with Dirty Three to record an In The Fishtank session for Konkurrent records. All Music Guide called the six-song disc &quot;some of the best material either unit has produced. &quot; Of particular note is the disc&#x27;s lengthy cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Down by the River. &quot; 2001 saw the release of Things We Lost in the Fire . The following year saw the release of the band&#x27;s final full-length on Kranky, Trust . All three of the band&#x27;s full-length releases on Kranky featured superstar producers: Secret Name and Things We Lost in the Fire feature the work of &quot;recordist&quot; Steve Albini (best known for producing abrasive noise rock and punk groups), who proved surprisingly sympathetic to capturing the band&#x27;s strengths; while Trust was recorded with Duluth engineer Eric Swanson and mixed by Tchad Blake. In April 2003, Peter S. Scholtes of the Twin Cities weekly paper City Pages posted in his weblog that Sally had left Low. The following month, the band posted an update to the news on their website: &quot;We have all had to work through some personal things recently &#8230; After sorting it out, the good news is that Zak is remaining in the band &#8230;&quot; In July 2003, they toured Europe with Radiohead, Sally in tow. Following a successful tour in early 2004 that vividly demonstrated the band&#x27;s commitment to their fans (Parker was visibly pregnant throughout), the band signaled their intent to continue making music by signing with powerhouse indie label Sub Pop. To fulfill their contract with Kranky, Low released a three-disc rarities compilation on that label in 2004. Beginning with Secret Name , the band have diversified their sound. The band use subtle electronic music touches to augment their sound, reflective of their tenure with Kranky and their exposure to the Midwest &#x27;s post-rock scene. Adding a more overt rock element to their aesthetic, the band has used fuzz bass from Things We Lost on the Fire onward, and began using distorted lead guitar on Trust . The band&#x27;s latest album, The Great Destroyer , nods even further in the direction of rock. Recorded with producer Dave Fridmann and released by Sub Pop in January 2005, The Great Destroyer has received mostly positive reviews; the Village Voice described the record&#x27;s &quot;comparatively thunderous verve. &quot; One notable exception to the critical applause is Pitchfork Media, which rated the album 5. 5 out of 10 and panned its lead single &quot;California. &quot; Low cancelled the second leg of their extensive tour in support of The Great Destroyer in late spring of 2005. Sparhawk&#x27;s informal statement, published on the band&#x27;s web forum and addressed directly to fans, detailed the personal reasons behind the cancellation. In August 2005, however, Sparhawk announced his return to performance, embarking on a United States tour with fellow slowcore pioneer, former Red House Painters frontman Mark Kozelek. However, in October 2005, Sally announced his resignation. Replacing him is Matt Livingston, a longtime bassist and saxophonist in Duluth&#x27;s musical scene. Performance Low are known for their impressive live performances. Rock club audiences typically watch the band while seated on the floor (due to the difficulty of standing for long periods while listening to such slow and quiet music). During their early career, the band often faced unsympathetic and inattentive audiences in bars and clubs, to which they responded by bucking rock protocol and turning their volume down. Their shows often feature drastically reinterpreted cover versions of famous songs by the likes of Joy Division and The Smiths, in addition to their own original material. Live, Low shows a sense of humor not necessarily found on their recordings; a tour in early 2004 featured a cover of OutKast&#x27;s hit song &quot;Hey Ya. &quot; At a gig in Los Angeles on Halloween 1998, the band took the stage as a Misfits tribute act, complete with corpse paint and black clothing. Commercial success The band&#x27;s mainstream exposure has been limited: their best-known song is arguably a hymnal version of &quot;The Little Drummer Boy,&quot; which was featured in a Gap television ad that depicted a snowball fight in slow-motion to match the song&#x27;s glacial tempo. A remix of their &quot;Halflight&quot; was featured in the Mothman Prophecies motion picture. However, because of their minimal overhead expenses (the band makes very little use of professional recording facilities), Low have managed to develop a reasonably comfortable career. Personal lives Sparhawk and Parker are married, have two children, and are practicing members of the Mormon faith. (Sparhawk was born into an LDS family in Seattle, and for some time lived in Utah before moving to Minnesota at age nine; he also briefly attended Brigham Young University. Parker is a convert. ) Lyrical references: Christianity and Mormonism Low are hardly a Christian rock group, however, at least in the usual sense: neither Sally&#x27;s religious affiliation (or lack thereof) nor Parker and Sparhawk&#x27;s faith is mentioned in their latest press kit. Low have often toured with other &quot;Christian, not Christian rock&quot; acts such as Pedro the Lion and the Danielson Famile. However, there are occasional lyrical references (usually subtle and/or indirect) to Parker and Sparhawk&#x27;s religion. Sometimes these references are traditional Christian themes. The song &quot;If You Were Born Today,&quot; on both the live album One More Reason to Forget and on the Christmas album, quietly suggests what might happen if Jesus were born in contemporary times. On Things We Lost in the Fire , the song &quot;Whore&quot; includes Parker&#x27;s haunting chorus &quot;you will get your reward&quot;, while Sparhawk asks &quot;is it so wrong to think there&#x27;s more?&quot; Disc one of A Lifetime of Temporary Relief includes the song &quot;David &amp; Jude,&quot; while disc two includes two versions of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; and the Spacemen 3 cover &quot;Lord, Can You Hear Me?&quot; Many references draw specifically on themes from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These include &quot;Weight of Water&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; on Secret Name , whose title itself refers to an LDS naming ritual; this album also contains the song &quot;Lion/Lamb. &quot; The Trust track &quot;The Lamb,&quot; at least partially concerns the death of Joseph Smith. The Christmas album&#x27;s religious content is generally more direct, including in addition to &quot;If you were born today&quot; an original song about the Three Wise Men&#x27;s subversion of Herod to protect Jesus (&quot;Long way around the sea&quot;), as well as traditionals (&quot;Silent night,&quot; &quot;Little drummer boy,&quot; the Elvis song &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;) and original secular, seasonal songs (&quot;Just Like Christmas,&quot; &quot;Taking down the tree,&quot; &quot;One special gift,&quot;). Lyrical references: Duluth, Minnesota, and elsewhere Low lyrics also subtly and indirectly reference geography. Very often, these geographic references center on their home in Duluth, Minnesota. Sparhawk has said that the song &quot;Sea,&quot; from I Could Live in Hope , is about Duluth. The lyrics say, &quot;The sea is a long, long way / from me . . . I&#x27;d go there if I had the time / but lying here will do just fine. &quot; To any Duluthian, this inevitably summons up Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes, at whose western tip Duluth rests. Lake Superior is not salt water, but it is a very, very large body of water, certainly as large as many bodies of water that are called &quot;seas. &quot; In fact, Lake Superior is sometimes called &quot;the Inland Sea. &quot; The EP Songs for a Dead Pilot , was reportedly dedicated to a pilot who crashed near Duluth in the late 1990s. On Things We Lost in the Fire , the song &quot;Sunflower&quot; may refer to a notorious murder up the North Shore of Lake Superior some time in the late 70s or early 80s. On Trust , cold Minnesota winters emerge in the lyrics, &quot;when we were young / we wanted to die / but the sound of a drum / and the words of a child / brought different light / now no one can tell / the winter was nice&#8230; the ground was so hard / the nights were so long / but we suffered the dark / and we wrote all those songs / still i was a fool / i covered my ears / no i would not face the last snowstorm of the year. &quot; (These lyrics also of course indulge both Low&#x27;s repeating, dark, self-destructive / murderous / suicidal theme as well as their theme about having children. ) Other lyrics have referred elsewhere. Secret Name includes the song &quot;Missouri,&quot; which may refer to the LDS community&#x27;s travels westward. Songs for a Dead Pilot &#x27;s last track is &quot;Hey Chicago,&quot; which says &quot;Hey Chicago, I&#x27;m leaving. &quot; On Trust , the song &quot;Canada,&quot; says &quot;you can&#x27;t take that stuff to Canada,&quot; which inescapably suggests advice to people attempting to take drugs across the border from the U. S. to Canada. (As Minnesota sits along the border of Ontario and Manitoba, this can also be seen as a reference to Minnesota. ) Songs on The Great Destroyer frequently reference geography. &quot;California,&quot; says &quot;Though it breaks your heart / We had to sell the farm / Back to California where it&#x27;s warm. &quot; This possibly refers to Sparhawk&#x27;s own mother selling the family farm upon which Sparhawk had grown up (compare the lyrics for &quot;Mom says&quot; on The Curtain Hits the Cast : &quot;mom says / a farm&#x27;s the best place to call home / but I don&#x27;t know. &quot;) &quot;Broadway (so many people)&quot; refers very specifically to the intersection of Broadway and East 4th Street in New York City: &quot;Last night just north of Houston / Broadway so many people / Through your third story window / I see my favorite record store . At a February 2004 show at &quot;Dante&#x27;s&quot; in Portland, Ore. , Sparhawk told the crowd that the song &quot;Walk into the Sea&quot; was about &quot;a guy who used to live here that we got know pretty well. He&#x27;s gone now&#8230;&quot; in what many fans believe was a reference to Academy Award-nominated singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, a long-time Portland resident. Smith had died just months earlier in October 2003. On the Murderer EP is the song, &quot;From Your Place on Sunset,&quot; which refers to many locations in the Los Angeles area. Side projects Low owns a record label, Chairkickers&#x27; Union, which releases material by other musicians such as Rivulets and Haley Bonar, as well as some of their own material. Sparhawk is notably active in Duluth&#x27;s small but vibrant independent music scene; he operates a recording studio in the town, in a deconsecrated church that naturally provides the lush reverb characteristic of Low&#x27;s sound. The Chairkickers label offers another outlet for Duluth musicians, as most groups on the label are from that city, or at least from Minnesota and surrounding areas. Sally has toured as a bassist with Dirty Three, and Sparhawk has devoted considerable time and energy to his Black Eyed Snakes project, a blues-rock revival band quite far removed from the Low aesthetic. Recently Sparhawk has also been seen with a new side project called The Retribution Gospel Choir. Matt Livingston, who became Low&#x27;s new bassist in late 2005, played in The Retribution Gospel Choir until early 2008 at which time Steve Garrington became the bassist for both this band and Low. On Retribution&#x27;s first tour (fall 2005), they played the Low song &quot;From Your Place on Sunset. &quot; (Similarly, Low and the Black-Eyed Snakes have played some overlapping songs, such as &quot;Lordy&quot;. )", "Igor Stravinsky": "Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky (Russian: Igor' Fiodorovich Stravinskii) (17th June 1882 - 6th April 1971) was a Russian composer who first achieved international fame with three ballets commissioned by the impresario Serge Diaghilev and performed by Diaghilev&#x27;s Ballets Russes (Russian Ballet): L&#x27;Oiseau de feu (&quot;The Firebird&quot;) (1910), Petrushka (1911), and Le sacre du printemps (&quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;) (1913). Stravinsky&#x27;s compositional career was notable for its stylistic diversity. After his first, Russian (expressionistic), phase he turned in the 1920s to neoclassicism. The works from this period tended to make use of traditional musical forms (concerto grosso, fugue, symphony), frequently concealed a vein of intense emotion beneath a surface appearance of detachment or austerity, and often paid tribute to the music of earlier masters, for example J. S. Bach, Verdi and Tchaikovsky. In the 1950s he adopted serial procedures, using the new techniques over the final twenty years of his life to write works that were briefer and of greater rhythmic, harmonic, and textural complexity than his earlier music. Their intricacy notwithstanding, these pieces share traits with all of Stravinsky&#x27;s earlier output; rhythmic energy, the construction of extended melodic ideas out of a few cells comprising only two or three notes, and clarity of form, instrumentation, and of utterance. Stravinsky only started using the twelve-tone system after the death of Schoenberg in 1951. At that time dodecaphony was a well-known and widely spread system that was generally accepted as a valuable &#x27;replacement&#x27; of the tonal system. Therefore, some musicologists thought it wiser to consider the serial works of Stravinsky as a sort of neo-dodecaphony, meaning that they are also conceived as &quot;neoclassical&quot;. Stravinsky achieved fame as a pianist and conductor, often at the premieres of his works. He was a writer and compiled, with the help of Alexis Roland-Manuel, a theoretical work entitled Poetics of Music, in which he famously claimed that music was incapable of &quot;expressing anything but itself&quot;. Several interviews in which the composer spoke to Robert Craft were published as Conversations with Stravinsky. They collaborated on five further volumes over the following decade. ", "Kendrick Lamar": "Kendrick Lamar (born June 17, 1987) is a rapper from Compton, California. He is also a member of the hip-hop supergroup Black Hippy collective along with members Jay Rock, Ab-Soul and Schoolboy Q. His music is largely influenced by the works of 2Pac, Jay-Z, Nas and DMX. Debuting in 2003 with the Youngest Head Nigga In Charge mixtape, Kendrick (then known as K Dot) signed with TDE. He released the Kendrick Lamar EP in 2009, the critically acclaimed O(verly) D(edicated) mix tape in 2010, a 2011 digital album Section. 80, released under Top Dawg Entertainment, good kid, m. A.

", "Los Hermanos": "There is more than one artist with this name: 1) Los Hermanos is a Brazilian band from the state of Rio de Janeiro, which mixes up indie rock with mpb and samba elements. The band members are Marcelo Camelo, Rodrigo Amarante (both guitars, lyrics and vocals), Bruno Medina (keyboard) and Rodrigo Barba (drums). Official Homepage of Los Hermanos They recorded two demos that eventually found their way into the hands of Paulo Andre, the producer of the Abril Pro Rock festival, in Recife. The band was then invited to perform on one of the biggest alternative music festivals in Brazil, the Superdemo. Their self-titled album, released in 1999, became a huge seller on the back of the hit single Anna Julia. Two less financially successful albums, Bloco do Eu Sozinho (2001) and Ventura (2003), followed, changing the punk-rock that highlighted their debut effort to a softer, more laid-back style. Although those two albums did not sell as much as the first one, they consolidated the band as a cult; mainly because of their so-called clever lyrics and mixture of brazilian rhytmhs with rock. Their newest record, simply titled 4 (four), was released in August, 2005. ______________ 2) Los Hermanos is a division closely attached to the urban american underground techno movement &quot;Underground Resistance&quot;. Each release has had its own distinct sound, concept and impact. Releases like &quot;Quetzal&quot; and the album &quot;On Another Level&quot; show urban melodic detroit techno on a different level. ", "The Pretty Reckless": "The Pretty Reckless is an American alternative rock band from New York, United States. The current members are Taylor Momsen (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Ben Phillips (lead guitar, backing vocals), Mark Damon (bass) and Jamie Perkins (drums). The band formed in 2009 when Momsen stated that she would quit acting after her television role Jenny Humphrey from the hit TV show Gossip Girl (2007-2012) to focus on her music career. They have released 2 studio albums: Light Me Up (2010), Going to Hell (2014), and a EP called Hit Me Like A Man (2012), which includes 3 new songs and 2 live version tracks from Light Me Up. The Pretty Reckless made history as the first female-fronted band to achieve No. 1 on the rock radio chart with two hit singles - &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; in March 2014, and &quot;Fucked Up World&quot;, in September 2014. ", "Bad Religion": "Bad Religion is a punk rock band from Los Angeles, California, known for poignant, erudite lyrics, and biting social commentary. The band was formed in 1979 by high school students Greg Graffin (vocals), Jay Bentley (bass guitar), Jay Ziskrout (drums), and Brett Gurewitz (guitar). In 1981, they released their eponymous debut EP on their own newly-formed label, Epitaph, managed and owned by Gurewitz. 1982 saw the release of their first full-length album, How Could Hell be Any Worse?, which gained them a sizable following. During the recording, Ziskrout left the band and was replaced by Peter Finestone. Greg Graffin, the band&#x27;s frontman, holds a Master&#x27;s degree in geology from UCLA and a Ph. D. in zoology from Cornell University. His dissertation for Cornell was a comprehensive study of how modern scientists, especially those who believe in strict Darwinism, view theism and religion, and how their own religious beliefs, if any, affect their study and work. He has since published it for fans of the band. In 1983, Bad Religion released into the unknown, a keyboard-driven psychedelic rock album that was enormously unpopular among the band&#x27;s core fan base. It is now out of print, and generally disowned by the band. However, in past years it has become a collectors item, and has gained some acceptance from fans. It now can be seen going for more than $100 on eBay, and is often pirated. In 1984, Greg Hetson (Circle Jerks) replaced Gurewitz. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, rock and roll version of their original sound with the back to the known, but they disbanded soon after. The band reformed in 1987 and released suffer in 1988, cementing their comeback in the punk community. Not only is this album considered one of their best by most fans, but it is often credited with &quot;saving&quot; the Southern Californian punk rock scene by fans and Bad Religion&#x27;s contemporaries alike. no control (1989) and against the grain (1990) further increased the band&#x27;s popularity, followed by generator (1992). Before the recording sessions for the latter album commenced, drummer Pete Finestone left the band in to focus on his other band, The Fishermen. Bobby Schayer joined the band as his replacement. recipe for hate (1993) followed shortly thereafter. With alternative rock breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion left Epitaph for major label Atlantic and quickly re-released Recipe for Hate on the major label. 1994&#x27;s stranger than fiction followed, but shortly after its release Brett Gurewitz left the band again. Officially, he cited the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph&#x27;s offices as the Offspring (then a part of the Epitaph roster) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. But it was well-known that the departure was not on good terms, as he later accused the band of selling out for leaving Epitaph in favor of a major label. Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band The Daredevils entitled &quot;Hate You,&quot; reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley. Gurewitz, moreover, was struggling more seriously with heroin and other addictions that had plagued him for years. Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker, former member of bands such as Minor Threat and Dag Nasty. Previously, Graffin and Gurewitz had split songwriting duties, but Gurewitz&#x27;s departure left Graffin as the band&#x27;s lone songwriter. What followed were a series of moderately successful albums, the gray race (1996), no substance (1998), and the new america (2000). As their popularity waned, Bad Religion left Atlantic in 2001 and returned to Epitaph. Bobby Schayer left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by Brooks Wackerman (Suicidal Tendencies) and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band in time to record the process of belief (2002). the empire strikes first was in June 2004. Both albums are widely regarded as a return to form for the band. In 2004, the band released digitally-remastered versions of five of their early albums ( How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, Suffer, No Control, Against the Grain, and Generator ). The How Could Hell Be Any Worse? re-issue also contained all of their first EP, the Public Service EP (alternative versions of Bad Religion, Slaves and Drastic Actions from the self titled EP) and Back To The Known . Bad Religion&#x27;s fourtheenth full-length studio album, titled new maps of hell, was released on July 10, 2007. It debuted at #35 on the U. S. Billboard 200, selling about 21,000 copies in its first week. It was originally intended to be released in 2006, but was pushed back largely due to the release of Graffin&#x27;s second solo album, cold as the clay and his work at UCLA. In 2010, Bad Religion released 30 Years Live for the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary. The album was available for free to subscribers of the Bad Religion mailing list. Later the same year, Bad Religion released their fifteenth studio album, The Dissent of Man. The album took nearly two years to write and record, mainly due to the band&#x27;s heavy touring schedule. Brett Gurewitz, who still heads Epitaph Records, still records with the band and plays local shows, but doesn&#x27;t tour with them. Greg Hetson can still be found at the occasional Circle Jerks show and helped open a bar in LA. Wackerman is working on a side project called The Kidneys. Graffin spends 10 weeks a year teaching two classes (Life Sciences 1 and Earth and Space Sciences 116) at UCLA. Jay Bentley keeps the Bad Religion MySpace page updated. ", "St. Vincent": "St. Vincent is a name of at least three artists: 1) A pseudonym of Annie Clark (b. 28 Sept 1982), a USA multi-instrumentalist singer-songwriter. She was a member of The Polyphonic Spree and Sufjan Stevens&#x27; touring band. Born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she began playing the guitar at the age of 12 and as a teenager worked as the tour manager for her uncle&#x27;s band Tuck &amp; Patti. She grew up in Dallas and attended Lake Highlands High School, graduating in 2001. Following this, she went on to attend Berklee College of Music, dropping out 3 years later. Soon after this, she joined The Polyphonic Spree. In 2003, during her time at Berklee, she released an EP with fellow students, entitled Ratsliveonnoevilstar. Clark joined Sufjan Stevens&#x27; touring band in 2006, bringing with her a tour EP entitled Paris Is Burning. It contains three tracks, including a cover version of Jackson Browne&#x27;s These Days. Clark released her debut album, Marry Me, 10 July 2007 on Beggars Banquet Records. Named after a line from the cult-hit television show Arrested Development, the LP features appearances from drummer Brian Teasley (Man or Astro-man?, The Polyphonic Spree), Mike Garson (David Bowie&#x27;s longtime pianist), and horn player Louis Schwadron (The Polyphonic Spree). In 2008 Clark was nominated for three PLUG Independent Music Awards: New Artist of the Year, Female Artist of the Year, and Music Video of the Year, and on 6 March 2008, she won the Female Artist of the Year award. Her second album for 4AD, entitled Actor, was released on 5 May 2009. It was written entirely by Clark and produced by Clark and John Congleton of The Paper Chase. The Strange Mercy Songfacts reports that Clark wrote her third album in Seattle. She decamped to the Northwestern city to escape from the information overload she was experiencing at home and recorded Strange Mercy in a studio provided by Death Cab For Cutie drummer Jason McGerr.

", "Death Cab for Cutie": "Death Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nicholas Harmer (bass), and Jason McGerr (drums). Death Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band&#x27;s vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles&#x27; 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour . As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords ; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums. The four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes . Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album&#x27;s production. His playing on \"The Employment Pages\" and \"Company Calls Epilogue\" were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs. Michael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E. P. , released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album . Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP . In 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism . Transatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band&#x27;s top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out. In spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E. P. titled The John Byrd E. P. , named for their sound engineer. The E. P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004. In November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a \"long-term worldwide deal\" with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www. deathcabforcutie. com that nothing would change except that \"Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7&quot;, there will be the letter &quot;A&quot; on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums. \" This was a marked change from Gibbard&#x27;s earlier views on major-label relations, which he said \"are set up to fuck you and take all your money. \". After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet. The first and second singles off the band&#x27;s Atlantic Record release Plans were \"Soul Meets Body\" and \"Crooked Teeth\", respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks. The band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights. In early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions , eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band&#x27;s website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006. On May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs , was released and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200.

The band&#x27;s seventh album, Codes and Keys , was released on May 31, 2011. The album&#x27;s first single was &quot;You Are A Tourist&quot;. On October 11, 2013, the band reportedly began working on their eighth studio album. This was then confirmed by the group&#x27;s official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption &quot;DCFC LP8 begins&quot;. The new album will be produced by Rich Costey and is expected to be released in early 2015. In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, &quot;I do think from start to finish it&#x27;s a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love. &quot; On October 29, 2013, the band released a remastered tenth-anniversary version of their 2003 album Transatlanticism. The new album included a vinyl LP and MP3 download, with demos for all the songs from the album. As part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording. On August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. Walla states that he plans to &quot;&#8230;continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible. &quot; When asked in an interview about Walla&#x27;s involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla &quot;played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he&#x27;s played his last show with us, he&#x27;s still been involved in everything involving this record. &quot;", "Belize": "Los Angeles, CA project Belize is set to release their debut LP Tidal Tales From The Other Side on June 21, 2011 through Gas Can Music. Fronted by singer-songwriter Casey Curry, Belize maintains influences from a diverse range of artists including Nick Cave, The Doors, Brian Wilson, Pink Floyd, Kevin Shields, and Lou Reed, resulting in a timeless rock sound that can best be described as the perfect mixture of modern indie and classic rock. ", "Major Lazer": "Major Lazer Place: Known Universe Galaxy: Unknown Time: 2008 Years after the zombie apocalypse ravaged the galaxy, Major Lazer went into isolation after bringing peace and order to Earth. With the help of a mysterious shadow government called Cinco he was cryogenically frozen as a safeguard for the future's wellbeing. Despite a great many years of pursuing peace on the planet, a new threat began to loom on the horizon and the commando was brought out of sleep by the Committee of Five. This intergalactic group faced an opponent that only Major Lazer could defend against: his former superior and commander General Rubbish. Rubbish had come out of deep space hiding with a new weapon&#8230;Terror Lazor and was set out to enslave and capture all of Earth&#x27;s allies to seize inter-galactic planetary control and then destroy Earth. With dwindling resources to defend Earth and it's allies, the Committee of Five brought Major Lazer out of cryogenic slumber. He was assigned a partner, the female assassin known only as Knife Fight. Together they set out to FREE THE UNIVERSE, beginning on the fortuitous date of April 15th, 2013. Since 2011, the group consists of Diplo, Jillionaire and Walshy Fire After releasing their landmark LP Guns Don&#x27;t Kill People&#8230;Lazers Do in 2009, the heroic production duo of Diplo and Switch found themselves boldly marching forwards toward the end of the aughts, conquering major milestones. From 2009 to 2011, the twosome toured extensively across the United States and the world, selling out shows and performing at some of music's major festivals, including Coachella, Pitchfork, Sasquatch, Outside Lands, and Falls Music &amp; Arts Festival. In 2010 Major Lazer released Lazerproof, a free download mixtape with pop sensation La Roux, and Lazers Never Die, an EP featuring two new tracks and three remixes, including one by Thom Yorke. One of the foremost breakthroughs for Major Lazer during this time was the production collaboration with Beyonce on her massive hit \"Run the World (Girls)\", which sampled their track \"Pon de Floor. &quot; Beyonce directly sought out Switch and Diplo, recognizing the fact that they were creating authentically innovative music and further cementing their status as a production team worthy of worldwide mainstream attention. As 2011 turned to 2012, Switch determined it best to pursue his own path, leaving Diplo in full control of Major Lazer. As the sole executive producer of Major Lazer, Diplo continued to spearhead the current dancehall revival movement with the 2013 release Free The Universe. That album included collaborations with Bruno Mars, Tyga, Flux Pavilion, Wynter Gordon, Shaggy, Wyclef Jean, Ezra Koening from Vampire Weekend, Dev and more. Spin called the LP's first single &quot;Get Free&quot; featuring Amber Coffman of Dirty Projectors, &quot;a meeting point between Jamaica, West Africa, and Brooklyn. &quot; Diplo (AKA Wesley Pentz) has risen through the ranks and has asserted himself as one of the most pioneering producers of the time. Through unending curiosity and exploration of the vast multitudes of the world's musical heritages, Diplo has managed to seamlessly connect the global underground to the audio mainstream. He is the Grammy-nominated founder, owner and head honcho of Mad Decent records, which has not only garnered widespread critical and audience accolades since its inception, but has also deservedly earned a hefty reputation as a vanguard of groundbreaking releases.

While Chrome Rats was critically hailed, Chromatics couldn&#x27;t keep it together, and Miller was soon the only member in good standing (Blilie, Welch, and Nolan went on to form the similar-sounding Shoplifting). Unworried, Miller added guitar and drum programming to his vocal duties and tapped bassist Nat Sahlstrom for the 2003 GSL 7&quot; Ice Hatchets. That was followed by the February 2004 full-length Plaster Hounds (which featured the percussion work of Get Hustle&#x27;s Ron Avila), and a repositioning of the Chromatics axis to greater reflect its dub and no wave influences.

", "Metronomy": "Metronomy is an electropop group which formed in 1999 in Totnes, Devon, United Kingdom, originally as the solo project of Joseph Mount. The project later expanded into a full band, which currently consists of Joseph Mount (vocals, keyboards, guitar), Oscar Cash (keyboards, saxophone, vocals), Gbenga Adelekan (bass, vocals) and Anna Prior (drums, vocals). The band has released four albums: &quot;Pip Paine (Pay The PS5000 You Owe)&quot; (2006), &quot;Nights Out&quot; (2008), &quot;The English Riviera&quot; (2011), and &quot;Love Letters&quot; (2014). Metronomy began in the tiny, bohemian market town of Totnes, Devon, when Joseph's Dad sold his son a computer so he could sit in his bedroom and make electronic music. He was inspired by the likes of Autechre, LFO and Aphex Twin, more as a creative hobby than a pop masterplan. After decamping to Brighton for Uni, Metronomy released their debut album in June 2006. It was called Pip Paine (Pay The PS5000 You Owe) , and its obtuse but fascinating, largely instrumental electro-pop reflected the eccentricity of its title, and the enduring influence of Totnes. Joseph admits that he only, finally, saw the commercial possibilities of Metronomy when DJ, producer, Trash founder and electro-punk avatar Erol Alkan began to feature the single You Could Easily Have Me in his sets, and asked Metronomy to play at his club. Cue the need for a proper live show, and the additions of Gabriel Stebbing, Oscar Cash, dance routines and clothes that blink. Move on 2 years and Nights Out a wonky love-child of Giorgio Moroder, New Order, Pet Shop Boys and Unfinished Sympathy is a second album that feels like a debut. The first to be vocal-led, with the self-effacing Joseph stepping up and grabbing the mic for most of the tracks; and, crucially, the first to introduce Metronomy as a fully live propsition, rather than a pseudonym for Joseph's solo work. As Metronomy's busy touring schedule built a buzz amongst kids who instinctively get the dance/art crossover, In April 2009 the Metronomy show took another leap in its evolution, with the addition for the first time of a live drummer in Anna Prior, and bassist Gbenga Adelekan. The new Metronomy was completely live, proving it is possible for electronic bands to put on show as authentic as any rock band. Meanwhile Joseph has embarked on a series of prestigious remixes for the likes of Klaxons, Franz Ferdinand, Gorillaz and collaborations with Kate Nash and Florence and The Machine. Metronomy produced part of the highly acclaimed Roots Manuva album Slime and Reason .

She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, and became the first recording artist to have her first five singles top the U. S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records established her position as Columbia&#x27;s highest-selling act. According to Billboard magazine, she was the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States, selling over 200 million records. Following her separation from Mottola in 1997, Carey introduced elements of hip hop into her album work, to much initial success, but her popularity was in decline when she left Columbia in 2001. She signed to Virgin Records but was paid to leave the label the following year after a highly publicized physical and emotional breakdown, as well as the poor reception given to Glitter, her film and soundtrack project.

", "Dong Fang Shen Qi": "", "Regina Spektor": "Regina Spektor (born Regina Ilyinichna Spektor on 18 February 1980 in Moscow) is a Russian-born American singer-songwriter and pianist. Her music is associated with the anti-folk scene centered on New York City&#x27;s East Village. Spektor studied classical piano from the age of six, practising on a Petrof piano given to her mother by her grandfather. She was also exposed to the music of rock and roll bands such as The Beatles, Queen, and The Moody Blues by her father, who obtained such recordings in Eastern Europe and traded cassettes with friends in the Soviet Union. The family left the Soviet Union in 1989, when Regina was nine, during the period of Perestroika when Jewish citizens were permitted to emigrate. The seriousness of her piano studies led her parents to consider not leaving Russia, but they finally decided to emigrate, for religious and political reasons. Travelling first to Austria and then Italy, the family settled in the Bronx, New York, United States where Spektor graduated from a middle school yeshiva. She then attended the Frisch Yeshiva High School in Paramus, New Jersey on a scholarship for two years, but, feeling out of place, eventually transferred to a secular public school, Fair Lawn High School, in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where she finished the last two years of her high school career . In New York, Spektor gained a firm grounding in classical music from her piano teacher, Sonia Vargas, a professor at the Manhattan School of Music. Spektor studied with Vargas--whom Spektor&#x27;s father had met through violinist Samuel Marder, Vargas&#x27;s husband--until she was 17. Although the family had been unable to bring their piano with them from Russia, Spektor found a piano on which to practice in the basement of her synagogue, also utilizing tabletops and other hard surfaces for this purpose. Although she had always made up songs around the house, Spektor first became interested in songwriting during a visit to Israel with the Nesiya Institute in her teenage years. Attracting attention from the other children on the trip for the songs she made up while hiking, she realized she had an aptitude for songwriting. Following this trip, she was first exposed to the work of Joni Mitchell, Ani DiFranco, and other singer-songwriters, which gave her the idea that she could create her own songs. She began writing her first a cappella songs around age 16, and wrote her first songs for voice and piano when she was nearly eighteen. Spektor completed the four-year studio composition program of the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College in Purchase, New York, including one year&#x27;s study in London, at the University of Middlesex - graduating with honours in 2001. Around this time, she also worked briefly at a butterfly farm in Luck, Wisconsin. She gradually achieved recognition through performances in the anti-folk scene in downtown New York City, most importantly at the East Village&#x27;s Sidewalk Cafe, but also at the Living Room, Tonic, Fez, the Knitting Factory, and CB&#x27;s Gallery. During this period, she sold her self-produced CDs 11:11 (2001) and Songs (2002) at such performances. The All The Rowboats Songfacts states that What We Saw From The Cheap Seats, Spektor&#x27;s sixth album, was recorded by the singer with Mike Elizondo in Los Angeles during the summer of 2011.

Their first album, entitled Beautiful Tragedy, was released on March 20th, 2007 on Century Media Records. The band&#x27;s sound falls on the melodic side of the metalcore spectrum, with vocalist Maria Brink utilizing both screams and a good deal of clean, emotive singing, the latter being even more prominent on the band&#x27;s second album, The Dream, released in 2008. Their third studio album was released on July 2010 named A Star-Crossed Wasteland  Band History In 2005, singer Maria Brink and guitarist Chris Howorth met through some common friends. After becoming acquainted they found there was much in common between the two and began writing songs. Soon thereafter they enlisted the help of Los Angeles drummer Jeff Fabb. By mid-2005, the lineup included Brink, Howorth, Fabb, guitarist Blake Bunzell, and bassist Josh Newell. The band recorded demos and posted them on Myspace, where they generated a large internet following. During the summer of 2005, Newell departed from the band to focus on his other project, Ketaset, as well as his sound engineering work. A close friend of the band named Pascual Romero (of Tinhorn) took over bass duties for a short time before Jesse Landry was given the position, and the band found its permanent lineup. By the end of the year, In This Moment had generated such a large following due to diligent internet marketing and &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; touring, they sparked an interest from Century Media Records.

They also said that they are set to enter the studio on February 23 to record their fifth studio album and follow up their break out album &quot;Blood,&quot; released in 2012. Chris Howorth says, \"We have a bunch of ideas and the way we did 'Blood' was different than we'd done any album before. We brought ideas and pieces and parts into the studio and wrote each song in the studio, one at a time. All the other albums we had the songs formatted and together already. So we're going to do the same thing again. We're gonna try to replicate the magic of 'Blood' and try to take the style and sound we had for 'Blood' and just do it bigger and better while still keeping true to that same vibe. That's our sound. We feel like we found something and want to stick the flag in the ground on top of that hill.

He was the lead singer of The Smiths, one of the most influential alternative bands in the 1980s. The group split up in 1987 and Morrissey started a successful solo career. His first solo album, Viva Hate was released only six months after The Smiths split, in March 1988. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Suedehead&quot; peaked at #5, a higher position than any Smiths single had ever achieved. In 1990, Bona Drag, a collection of his solo singles and b-sides, including popular songs such as &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot; and &quot;Everyday is Like Sunday&quot; (which also appears on &quot;Viva Hate&quot;) His second album 1991&#x27;s Kill Uncle was not as well received as his first, with neither single achieving the Top 20. In 1992, the Mick Ronson-produced Your Arsenal was released and included singles such as &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;We Hate It When Our Friends Become Successful&quot;. A live album, Beethoven Was Deaf, followed in 1993. In 1994, Morrissey released Vauxhall and I, which contained &quot;The More You Ignore Me, The Closer I Get&quot;, his biggest hit in the United States, where it peaked at #46. Later that year, Morrissey also recorded a one-off project with Siouxsie of Siouxsie and the Banshees: they sang in duet on the single Interlude. After &quot;Vauxhall and I&quot;, Morrissey released Southpaw Grammar (1995) and Maladjusted (1997), both of which failed to produce a UK Top 20 single. A period of musical inactivity followed in the late 90s and early 2000s, which was due to failure in finding a suitable label, according to a 2004 interview with Jools Holland. After seven years without a new album release, You Are the Quarry was released on May 17, 2004 (but one day later in the USA). The first single, Irish Blood, English Heart, was released internationally on May 10, 2004. The single reached number three in its first week of sales in the UK singles chart. To date, this is the highest placing chart position for Morrissey in his entire career as both a solo artist and the lead singer of The Smiths (the 2006 release You Have Killed Me also debuted at number three in its first week in the charts). It has sold over a million copies, making the album his most successful, solo or with The Smiths. Ringleader Of The Tormentors, produced by former David Bowie producer Tony Visconti, was released in April 2006. The album went straight to the top of the UK Album charts. Morrissey released a new Greatest Hits collection in February 2008, including two new songs: All You Need Is Me and That's How People Grow Up, both released as singles. Morrissey is now signed to Decca Records. In 2009, Morrissey released his latest album, Years of Refusal, which was produced by Jerry Finn, his final production credit before his death. Later in the year, Morrissey released the B-sides collection Swords. 2009 also saw the re-releases of Maladjusted and Southpaw Grammar, two of his most critically maligned albums. The Maladjusted re-release ditched two of its singles, Papa Jack and Roy&#x27;s Keen, in favour of several other tracks from the period, such as I Can Have Both. Sorrow Will Come in the End, written about Morrissey&#x27;s vicious legal battle with Smiths drummer Mike Joyce, was also re-instated to the UK edition. Southpaw Grammar retained all of its original tracks, albeit re-sequenced, but recieved the addition of other tracks from that time period, including the new album closer Nobody Loves Us. Two other Morrissey releases came in 2009; The HMV/Parlophone Singles &#x27;88-&#x27;95 and Swords, the former a 3 CD compilation of singles and B-sides from Viva Hate through to Vauxhall and I, the latter a compilation of B-sides from You Are The Quarry, Ringleader of the Tormentors, and Years of Refusal. A new Very Best Of collection was released in 2011, accompanied by a UK tour. ", "Florence + the Machine": "Florence + the Machine (a stylisation of Florence and The Machine), is a London, UK, art pop band led by singer-songwriter Florence Welch and formed in 2007. The band consists of: Florence Welch (vocals), Robert Ackroyd (guitar), Isabella Summers (aka Isa Machine - keyboards), Tom Monger (harp), Mark Saunders (bass, percussion), Christopher Lloyd Hayden (drums, backing vocals), Rusty Bradshaw (keyboard, backing vocals) and Sam White (backing vocals). Lead singer, Florence Welch, was an art-college drop-out, from Camberwell (London), who was discovered singing Motown covers in a nightclub toilet, drunk. \"The Machine\" name originated with an in-joke between Welch and Summers. Musically, Florence + The Machine&#x27;s sound is sometimes referred to as soul-inspired indie rock. Welch grew up listening to The White Stripes and Kate Bush and says she writes metaphorical songs that are &quot;stories with consequences and weird morality issues. &quot; 2008 Florence + The Machine&#x27;s music has received praise across the British music media, especially from the BBC, who played a large part in their rise to prominence, by bringing them into the spotlight as part of &quot;BBC Introducing&quot; (a program to support unsigned artists) - firstly at South By South West (SXSW) in Austin, Texas in March 2008 and later that year (Sept 2008) the band recorded a full session for the BBC at their Maida Vale studios. 2009 - 2010 - first awards and first studio album - &quot;Lungs&quot; At the Brit Awards 2009, Florence + The Machine received the Critics&#x27; Choice Award at the Brits in the UK. The award was introduced in 2008 (when it was awarded to Adele) and focuses on new and emerging British talent, voted for by a panel of music industry experts. The band&#x27;s debut album was &quot;Lungs&quot; (Jul 2009, Universal), preceded by third single Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up) (Jun 2009, Moshi Moshi). &quot;Lungs&quot; went on to become number one in the UK album charts in January 2010, and won the MasterCard British Album award at the 2010 Brits, where they performed a hugely popular collaboration, You&#x27;ve Got the Dirtee Love (live at The Brit Awards 2010) with Dizzee Rascal - a mix of You&#x27;ve Got the Love, the Candi Staton cover from &quot;Dog Days Are Over&quot; (Nov 2008, IAmSound), and Dizzee's Dirtee Cash (Sept 2009, Dirtee Stank). 2011 - second studio album - &quot;Ceremonials&quot; The second album &quot;Ceremonials&quot; (31 Oct 2011, Island) - with which Welch was inspired for the title and some themes from a &#x27;70s Super 8 film of an art installation, she recalls: &quot;&#8230; this big procession of kind of coquette-style hippies and all these different coloured robes and masks, and it was all to do with colour, really saturated, brightly coloured pastas and balloons. I saw it a couple years ago, and it was called &#x27; Ceremonials &#x27; and then, like, Roman numerals after it. And the word sort of stuck with me, and I think the whole idea of performance &#8230;&quot; . The album is also influenced by hymns, poems and church bells. 2012 - MTV Unplugged album - &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; In 2012, the band released a live album - &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (Apr 2012, Universal) - as part of the MTV Unplugged series. It was filmed in December 2011 in New York's oldest synagogue building, Angel Orensanz Center, with the band being backed by a ten-person choir. 2015 - third album announced - &quot;How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful&quot; The band&#x27;s long awaited third studio album is called &quot;How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful&quot;. It is scheduled for released on May 29, 2015 on Island Records. ", "Rage Against The Machine": "Rage Against the Machine is an American rap metal band, formed in 1991 in Los Angeles, California. The band&#x27;s line-up comprises vocalist Zack de la Rocha, guitarist Tom Morello, bassist Tim Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk. Critics have noted Rage Against the Machine for its &quot;fiercely polemical music, which brewed sloganeering leftist rants against corporate America, cultural imperialism, and government oppression into a Molotov cocktail of hardcore punk, hip hop, alternative metal, and funk. &quot; Rage Against the Machine drew inspiration from early heavy metal instrumentation, as well as rap acts such as Afrika Bambaataa, Public Enemy and Beastie Boys. In 1992, the band released its self-titled debut album, which became a commercial success, leading to a slot in the 1993 Lollapalooza. The band did not release a follow-up record until 1996, with Evil Empire. The band&#x27;s third album The Battle of Los Angeles was released in 1999. During their initial nine year run, they became one of the most popular and influential political bands in contemporary music. Shortly after breaking up in 2000, the band released the cover album Renegades. De la Rocha &amp; Morello both started low-key solo careers; the rest of the band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden, which disbanded in 2007, and in April of that year, Rage Against the Machine performed together for the first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band has continued to perform at many live venues and festivals around the world since 2007 but have not recorded any new studio material, as of yet. Due to a popular Facebook Campaign in 2009, the band managed to beat Joe McElderry, winner of the X Factor 2009, to the UK Christmas number one spot. This broke the chain of X Factor winners reaching the Christmas number one spot. To celebrate, Rage Against The Machine held a free gig to show their gratitude towards their fans. ", "[unknown]": "is a standard artist name used at MusicBrainz for indicating where an artist name is lacking or not provided. ", "Gary Numan": "Gary Numan (born Gary Anthony James Webb on 8 March 1958) is an influential English singer, composer, and musician. Most widely known for his chart-topping 1979 hits &quot;Are &#x27;Friends&#x27; Electric?&quot; (when in Tubeway Army) and &quot;Cars&quot;, Numan achieved his peak of mainstream popularity in the late 70s and early 80s but maintains a loyal cult following. Numan, whose signature sound consists of heavy synthesizer hooks fed through guitar effects pedals, is considered a pioneer of commercial electronic music. Both Numan&#x27;s music and his transgressive public image are known for his sense of alien coldness and embrace of avant-garde influences. Becoming of the founding fathers of electronic-based pop music, Numan&#x27;s reach extends far beyond his lone American hit, \"Cars,\" which still stands as one of the defining new wave singles. That seminal track helped usher in the synthpop era on both sides of the Atlantic, especially his native England, where he was a genuine pop star and consistent hit-maker during the early 80s. Even after new wave had mostly petered out, Numan's influence continued to make itself felt. His dark, paranoid vision, theatrically icy persona, and clinical, robotic sound were echoed strongly in the work of many goth rock and ( especially ) industrial artists during the past several decades. For his part, Numan just kept on recording, and, by the late 90s, he'd become a hip name to drop. Prominent alternative rock bands have covered his hits, with Numan himself playing live with Nine Inch Nails briefly to much acclaim, and a goth-flavored brand of industrial-type music christened darkwave looks to him as its mentor. Numan was born Gary Anthony James Webb on March 8, 1958, in Hammersmith, West London, U. K. A shy child, music brought him out of his shell; he began playing guitar in his early teens and played in several short-lived bands. Inspired by the amateurism of the punk movement, he joined a punk rock group called &quot; The Lasers &quot; in 1976. The following year, he and bassist Paul Gardiner split off to form a new group, dubbed &quot; Tubeway Army &quot;, with drummer Bob Simmonds . They recorded a couple of singles under futuristic pseudonyms ( Valerium , Scarlett, and Rael, respectively ) that attempted to match their new interest in synthesizers. Scrapping that idea, Webb rechristened himself Gary Numan and replaced Simmonds with his uncle Jess Lidyard . Thus constituted, &quot;Tubeway Army&quot; cut a set of &quot; punk-meets-Kraftwerk &quot; demos for Beggars Banquet in early 1978. That work ended up being released several years later as &#x27; The Plan &#x27;. That summer, Numan sang a TV commercial jingle for jeans, and toward the end of the year the group's debut album, &#x27; Tubeway Army &#x27;, appeared. Chiefly influenced by Kraftwerk and David Bowie's Berlin-era collaborations with Brian Eno , the album also displayed Numan's fascination with the electronic, experimental side of glam rock (such as in some works by Roxy Music and Ultravox ) and Krautrock (such as in some works by Can ). He also drew much influence from transgressive science fiction writers such as Philip K. Dick , people who challenged conventional thinking through exploring the affects of new technology. The group's second album, &#x27; Replicas &#x27;, was released in early 1979. Its accompanying single, \"Are 'Friends' Electric?&quot;, was a left-field smash, topping the UK charts and sending &#x27; Replicas &#x27; to number one on the album listings as well. The record also included \"Down in the Park&quot;, an oft-covered song that stands as one of Numan's most &#x27;gothic&#x27; outings. Numan had become a star overnight, despite critical distaste for any music so heavily reliant on synthesizers, and he formed a larger backing band that replaced &quot;Tubeway Army&quot;, keeping Gardiner on bass. &quot; The Pleasure Principle &quot; was released in the fall of 1979 and spawned Numan's international hit \" Cars \", which reached the American Top Ten and hit number one in the UK; the album also became Numan's second straight British number one. He put together a hugely elaborate, futuristic stage show and went on a money-losing tour, and also began to indulge his hobby as an amateur pilot with his newfound wealth. Numan returned in the fall of 1980 with &quot; Telekon &quot;, his third straight chart-topping album in Britain, and scored two Top Ten hits with \" We Are Glass \" and \" I Die: You Die \"; \" This Wreckage \" later reached the Top 20. In 1981, Numan announced his retirement from live performance, playing several farewell concerts just prior to the release of &quot; Dance &quot;. While &quot;Dance&quot; and its lead single, \" She's Got Claws \", were both climbing into the British Top Ten, Numan attempted to fly around the world, but in a bizarre twist was arrested in India on suspicion of spying and smuggling. The charges were dropped, although authorities confiscated his plane. His retirement proved short-lived, but when he returned in 1982 with &quot; I, Assassin &quot;, some of his popularity had dissipated - perhaps because of the retirement announcement, perhaps because the charts were overflowing with synthpop, much of which was already expanding on Numan's early innovations ( which were starting to sound repetitive ). &quot;I, Assassin&quot; was another Top Ten album, and \" We Take Mystery (To Bed) \" another major hit, but in general Numan's singles were starting to slip on the charts; the title track of 1983's &quot; Warriors &quot; became his last British Top Twenty hit ( excluding reissues and collaborations ). Numan and Beggars Banquet subsequently parted ways, and Numan formed his own Numa label, kicking things off with &quot; Berserker &quot; in late 1984. Sadly, longtime collaborator &quot;Paul Gardiner&quot; died earlier that year from a drug overdose. 1985's &quot; The Fury &quot; became the final Numan album to reach the British Top 30. Over the next few years, Numan collaborated occasionally with &quot; Shakatak's &quot; Bill Sharpe , releasing four singles and one album from 1985-1989. Following 1986's &quot; Strange Charm &quot;, Numan signed with IRS, but the relationship was fraught with discord from the start. IRS forced Numan to change the title of 1988's &quot; Metal Rhythm &quot; to &quot; New Anger &quot; for his first North American release since 1981 ( and also remixed several tracks ), refused to release his soundtrack for the film &quot; The Unborn &quot;, and would not fund any supporting tours for &quot;New Anger&quot; or 1991's &quot; Outland &quot;. When his contract expired, Numan returned to Numa for 1992's &quot; Machine + Soul &quot;. 1994 brought the release of the industrial-tinged &quot; Sacrifice &quot;, the first glimmering of Numan's return to critical favor and underground hipness. Over the next few years, bands like &quot; Hole &quot;, &quot; The Foo Fighters &quot;, and &quot; Smashing Pumpkins &quot; covered Numan songs in concert, and Marilyn Manson recorded \" Down in the Park \" for the B-side of the \" Lunchbox \" single; moreover, &quot; Nine Inch Nails &quot; cited Numan as an important influence. With his fan base refreshed and expectations raised, Numan delved deeper into gothic, metal-tinged industrial dance on 1997's &quot; Exile &quot;. However, he didn't truly hit his stride in this newly adopted style until 2000's &quot; Pure &quot;, which was acclaimed as his best work in years and expanded his cult following into new territory. In 2003, Numan enjoyed fleeting chart success once again with the &quot; Gary Numan vs Rico &quot; single \" Crazier \", reaching No. 13 in the U. K. chart. Rico, who is an up and coming artist from Glasgow, also worked on the remix album &quot; Hybrid &quot; which featured reworkings of older songs in a more contemporary industrial style. In 2004 Numan took control of his own business affairs again, launching the label Mortal Records and releasing a series of live DVDs as a precursor to his highly anticipated new studio album, &quot; Jagged &quot; which was released on 13 March 2006. An album launch gig took place at &quot; The Forum, London &quot; on 18 March 2006. Numan announced a UK tour commencing in April 2006 and plans to tour other countries, including the USA, during the year in support of the release. Numan also to launched a &quot; Jagged &quot; website to showcase the new album. Numan contributed vocals to four tracks on the April 2007 release of Ade Fenton's debut solo album &quot; Artificial Perfect &quot; on his new industrial/electronic label Submission, including songs \" The Leather Sea \", \" Slide Away \", \" Recall \" and the first single to be taken from the album, \" Healing \". The second single to be released in the UK was \" The Leather Sea \" on July 30, 2007. In 2008, he released a double CD remix album &quot; Jagged Edge &quot;, based around 2006's critically acclaimed &quot;Jagged&quot;, co-produced with Ade Fenton. The pair are currently in the studio working on Numan's 18th studio album &quot; Splinter &quot;, due for release in 2009. While Numan is known for his electronic music innovations, he prefers real instruments. He explained in an interview with Songfacts : &quot;I didn&#x27;t go the technology route wholeheartedly, the way Kraftwerk had done. I considered it to be a layer. I added to what we already had, and I wanted to merge that. There&#x27;s plenty of things about guitar players, and bass players, and songs I really love that I didn&#x27;t particularly want to get rid of. The only time I did get rid of guitars was on Pleasure Principle, and that was in fact a reaction to the press. I got a huge amount of hostility from the British press, particularly, when I first became successful. And Pleasure Principle was the first album I made after that success happened. I became successful in the early part of &#x27;79 and Pleasure Principle came out in the end of &#x27;79, in the UK, anyway. And there was a lot of talk about electronic music being cold and weak and all that sort of stuff. So I made Pleasure Principle to try to prove a point, that you could make a contemporary album that didn&#x27;t have guitar in it, but still had enough power and would stand up well. That&#x27;s the only reason that album didn&#x27;t have guitar in it. But apart from that one album they&#x27;ve all had guitars - that was the blueprint. &quot; The official website can be found here: www. garynuman. co. uk", "Dream Theater": "Dream Theater is an American progressive metal band formed in 1985 under the name Majesty by John Petrucci, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy while they attended Berklee College of Music in Massachusetts, before they dropped out to support the band. Though a number of lineup changes followed, including Portnoy&#x27;s departure in 2010, Petrucci and Myung remain today along with James LaBrie, Jordan Rudess and Mike Mangini. The band has had moderate mainstream success, notably with Pull Me Under in the early 1990s, which received extensive MTV rotation. Dream Theater&#x27;s (commonly abbreviated &#x27;DT&#x27;) three highest selling albums are the gold selling Images and Words (1992), despite it reaching only #61 on the Billboard 200 charts, and Awake (1994) which reached #32 on the Billboard 200. Systematic Chaos entered US Billboard 200 at #19. Recently Black Clouds and Silver Linings reached #6 on the Billboard 200 Charts. Dream Theater has sold over two million albums in the U. S. , and over 8 million albums and DVDs worldwide. In January of 2005, the band obtained their first United States platinum disc (representing 100 000 DVDs sold) with Live At Budokan, recorded April 2004 in Tokyo, Japan. The band released an album entitled Systematic Chaos, their ninth studio album, in collaboration with their new label Roadrunner Records. The album is available in two formats, first one being just a regular edition CD and the other being a CD/DVD album with the entire album mixed in 5. 1 surround sound and also &quot;Chaos in Progress - The Making of Systematic Chaos&quot; (a 90-minute documentary directed by Mike Portnoy). The band is well-known for the technical proficiency of each instrumentalist, winning many awards from music magazines. They are highly respected by many of rock and metal&#x27;s biggest names, leading to collaborations between Dream Theater members and many other well known musicians. In a famous example, guitarist John Petrucci was named as the third player on the G3 tour with Steve Vai and Joe Satriani, following in the foot steps of Eric Johnson, Robert Fripp, and Yngwie Malmsteen. Dream Theater is also noted for their musical versatility and the many different genres their music incorporates, which has made it possible for them to perform with a very diverse range of acts. Some of their more notable touring partners include Deep Purple, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Iron Maiden, Joe Satriani, King&#x27;s X, Marillion, Megadeth, In Flames, Pain of Salvation, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, Queensryche, Spock&#x27;s Beard, Fear Factory, Enchant, Symphony X, Yes, Big Wreck, I Mother Earth and Fates Warning.

However, this name was short-lived as another band were performing and recording under the same name. So, they re-named themselves Dream Theater after a small cinema which was close to where drummer Mike Portnoy&#x27;s father was living at the time. The name Majesty is the source of the band&#x27;s &quot;M&quot; logo appearing on the cover artwork of several albums. The Dream Theater song entitled &quot;Ytse Jam&quot; is &quot;Majesty&quot; backwards and &quot;Ytse Jam&quot; is also the name of Mike Portnoy&#x27;s record label. Official website: http://www. dreamtheater. net/", "Beastie Boys": "Beastie Boys were an American hip-hop trio from New York City, United States: Brooklyn and Manhattan. The members were Mike D (real name Michael Diamond), Ad-Rock (Adam Horovitz) and, until his death in May 2012, MCA (Adam Yauch). The Beastie Boys were the first successful white rap group and one of the few acts from the early days of hip-hop that still enjoyed major success their whole career Their rock and punk-influenced rap has had a significant impact on artists both in and outside the hip-hop scene, and they were the first rap group to gain a substantial following with alternative rock fans. The Beastie Boys came together in 1979 as a punk band called The Young Aboriginies. In 1981 MCA joined the group and from the suggestion of their guitarist John Berry, they changed their name to Beastie Boys. Their line up then consisted of Adam Yauch (aka MCA) on bass, drummer Kate Schellenbach (later of Luscious Jackson), guitarist John Berry (of Big Fat Love), and Mike Diamond (aka Mike D) on the mic. Beastie Boys&#x27; debut EP, the Pollywog Stew vinyl 7&quot; was released in 1982. The band&#x27;s first foray into hip hop, the Cooky Puss 12&quot;, followed in 1983, with The Young and the Useless guitarist Adam Horovitz (aka Adrock) replacing John Berry. &quot;Cooky Puss&quot; would be the first B Boys record to receive play at NYC clubs like Danceteria as the band played its first shows outside the city. The Mike D/MCA/Adrock Beastie Boys lineup debuted in 1984 with the &quot;Rock Hard&quot;/&quot;Beastie Groove&quot; 12. &quot; Produced by Rick Rubin, who went on to produce albums for the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash and Audioslave. The &quot;She&#x27;s On It&quot;/ &quot;Slow And Low&quot; 12&quot; followed in 1985 and Beastie Boys went on Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Virgin Tour. &quot; as her opening act. Licensed to Ill dropped in fall 1986 and became the first Beastie Boys album&ndash;and the first Rap album ever&ndash;to go #1. Fueled by Fight for Your Right and No Sleep Till Brooklyn it remained at #1 for seven weeks and simultaneously reached #2 on the urban chart, becoming the fastest selling debut to date for Columbia and the first hip hop record to break 5 million. In 1989 Beastie Boys released their second album Paul's Boutique produced by Beastie Boys and the Dust Brothers. Paul&#x27;s Boutique laid down the blueprint for a generation of emergent genres and went over the collective head of a nation. The likes of &quot;Shake Your Rump,&quot; &quot;Lookin&#x27; Down The Barrel Of A Gun,&quot; &quot;Car Thief,&quot; Shadrach,&quot; and the hip hop &quot;suite&quot; &quot;B-Boy Bouillabaisse&quot; contained lyrical and musical references too plentiful and diverse for the average mind to compute in one sitting. Check Your Head, released in 1992, heralded the return of live instrumentation into the B Boys mix. The album was produced by the band and Mario Caldato Jr. (who first worked with B Boys as engineer on Paul&#x27;s Boutique), Check Your Head would yield a watershed of new B Boys staples, including So Whatcha&#x27; Want, Pass The Mic, &quot;Gratitude&quot; and &quot;Jimmy James. &quot; With the assistance of Keyboard Money Mark, Eric Bobo and assorted percussionists, Beastie Boys returned to the touring circuit and Check Your Head hit double platinum. In the summer of 1994, Ill Communication, also produced by the band and Mario Caldato Jr. , entered the charts #1. The album featured such hits Sure Shot and Sabotage. Ill Communication was supported by Beastie Boys&#x27; first arena headline tour since the &#x27;80s. Following the tour&#x27;s conclusion, Beastie Boys recorded and released Aglio e Olio consisting of eight songs clocking in at 11 minutes, the EP recalls the vintage hardcore punk of the band&#x27;s infancy. On July 14 1998, their fifth album titled Hello Nasty was released. Spurred by the monster success of the &quot;Intergalactic&quot; single and video, the record clocked first week sales of nearly 700,000 in the U. S. and went straight in at #1 in England, Germany, Australia, Holland, New Zealand and Sweden. Early in the tour, Beastie Boys made live tracks available for free download to fans unable to attend the shows-and were blindsided by their label pulling the tracks down. Having closed 1998 by accepting the Video Vanguard lifetime achievement honor at the MTV Video Music Awards, Beastie Boys rang in 1999 with Artist, Band and/or Record of the Year accolades from the likes of Rolling Stone, SPIN, The New Yorker and Playboy, among others. A month later, at the 41st Annual Grammy Awards, the now quadruple-platinum Hello Nasty took Best Alternative Music Performance, while &quot;Intergalactic,&quot; nailed Best Rap Performance By A Duo Or Group&ndash;the first time an artist has ever won in both Rap and Alternative categories. 1999 would also see &quot;Intergalactic&quot; take Best Hip Hop Video honors at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. Beastie Boys&#x27; sixth studio album, To The 5 Boroughs, released in summer 2004, was the band&#x27;s third consecutive #1 debut-and Rolling Stone magazine&#x27;s only 5-star review of the year. To The 5 Boroughs was supported by world tour - traveling pageant - supported by Talib Kweli and Bob Moore&#x27;s Amazing Mongrels (yes, a live dog show, hence the pageant appellation). 2006 saw the release of the film, Awesome, I Fuckin&#x27; Shot That!, a concert film made up of footage filmed by audience members, which debuted at Sundance in early 2006 and was released theatrically the same year. In 2007 Beastie Boys released The Mix-Up, first ever full length offering of all-new, all-original instrumental recordings. On February 3rd, 2009, they digitally remastered and released Paul&#x27;s Boutique on their website. The band&#x27;s next record, &quot;Hot Sauce Committee Part 2&quot; was released in the first quarter of 2011. It features the same tracklisting as the previously announced &quot;Hot Sauce Committee Part 1&quot;, which was delayed indefinitely after Yauch was diagnosed with a tumor on his parotid gland (which was successfully removed). Bassist and vocalist Adam Yauch died on May 4, 2012 of cancer. In June 2014, Mike D stated that the Beastie Boys would not continue their careers as a group, as a promise to Adam Yauch. &quot;We have not been able to tour since MCA, Adam Yauch, died,&quot; Diamond said. &quot;We can&#x27;t make new music. &quot;", "Unwound": "Unwound was an American post-hardcore band based in Olympia, Washington, United States. Formed in 1991, the band consisted of Justin Trosper (guitars and vocals), Vern Rumsey (bass), and Brandt Sandeno (drums), all of whom had previously been in a band called Giant Henry. Brandt Sandeno quit Unwound in 1992 and was replaced by Sara Lund. This lineup would remain in place until the band&#x27;s dissolution in 2002. The group was strongly associated with the label Kill Rock Stars throughout the 1990s. Unwound was sharply dissonant and angular, often resorting to unusual guitar tones, and associated with post-hardcore and noise rock. The band toured frequently, preferring &quot;all ages&quot; clubs and are noted for their strong DIY ethic. The group spawned numerous side projects. http://www. unwoundarchive. com", "The Growlers": "Take 5 southern california guys, mix in some surf, stone, and psychedelic, throw them in a haunted mansion in west hochiminster and with a little luck, you might get a band like The Growlers.

Beginning his musical career in the Swing Era along with Harry James and Tommy Dorsey, Sinatra became a highly successful solo artist, releasing 59 studio albums and becoming the idol of the &#x27;bobby soxers&#x27;. His professional career had stalled by the 1950s, but it was reborn in 1954 after he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He signed with Capitol Records and released several critically lauded albums (such as In the Wee Small Hours, Songs For Swingin&#x27; Lovers, Come Fly With Me, Only the Lonely and Nice &#x27;n&#x27; Easy). Sinatra left Capitol to found his own record label, Reprise Records (finding success with albums such as Ring-A-Ding-Ding, Sinatra at the Sands and Francis Albert Sinatra &amp; Antonio Carlos Jobim), toured internationally, and fraternized with the Rat Pack and President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. Sinatra turned fifty in 1965, recorded the retrospective September of My Years, and scored hits with &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; and &quot;My Way&quot;. Sinatra attempted to weather the changing tastes in popular music, but with dwindling album sales and after appearing in several poorly received films, he retired in 1971. Coming out of retirement in 1973, he recorded several albums, scoring a hit with &quot;(Theme From) New York, New York&quot;, and toured both within the United States and internationally until a few years before his death in 1998. Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey and had three children; Nancy , Frank Jr. and Tina by his first wife Nancy Barbato. He was married three more times, to the actresses Ava Gardner and Mia Farrow and finally to Barbara Marx, to whom he was married at his death. Sinatra is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983 and was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985 and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. One of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century, Sinatra had a popularity that was later matched only by Elvis Presley, The Beatles, and ichael Jackson. American music critic Robert Christgau called him &quot;the greatest singer of the 20th century&quot;. http://www. sinatra. com/", "Thundercat": "Thundercat is a pseudonym of Stephen Bruner (b. Los Angeles, CA, USA), a virtuoso bassist, composer, producer and singer. He debuted with No Curfew&#x27;s &quot; 18 &quot; (2001) and his latest album is &quot; Apocalypse &quot; (Jun 2013, Brainfeeder). A member of legendary thrash punks Suicidal Tendencies (since 16 years of age), a protege of Steven Ellison (aka Flying Lotus) - Bruner has collaborated with many, including jams with Snoop Dogg and Stanley Clarke . \"I do believe that hip-hop can be the new jazz, and I'm helping create that\", Bruner said in an interview to Bass Player, in 2008. He is part of this new generation of jazz literate / hip-hop loving instrumentalists, who can play beyond traditional limits - a mutant jazz cat - and, that's how &#x27;Thundercat&#x27; (a monicker he chose), suits him well (even if it's purely the result of an unhealthy cartoon addiction, dating back to childhood).

Glover first came to attention for his work in the sketch group Derrick Comedy and is best known for his role as community college student Troy Barnes on the NBC comedy series Community. Glover was born in Edwards Air Force Base, California, and raised in Stone Mountain, Georgia, United States. He graduated from New York University with a degree in Dramatic Writing in 2006. Glover is known for his work on the NBC show Community alongside Joel McHale and Chevy Chase. Glover was a writer for The Daily Show in 2005 and the NBC series 30 Rock from 2008 to 2009, where he also had an occasional cameo appearance. He was presented the Writers Guild of America Award award for Best Comedy Series at the February 2009 ceremony for his work on the third season of 30 Rock. Glover raps as Childish Gambino, a name he found from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. He released an album entitled Sick Boi on June 5, 2008, in which he thanks himself. On September 17, 2009, Gambino released the album Poindexter. A pair of mixtapes entitled I Am Just A Rapper, and I Am Just A Rapper 2 were released in close succession in early 2010; Robert Scahill added his producing expertise, helping with the majority of the tracks. His third album, Culdesac, was set to be released on July 2, 2010, but a couple of last minute additions caused the album to be delayed for a day. The album was made available on July 3. Glover has stated in interviews that on &quot;Sick Boi&quot; and &quot;Poindexter&quot; he felt he had to hide behind gimmicks, such as pink hoodies. But with his subsequent projects, he has touched on more personal subject matter, including family, schoolyard bullying, troubled romantic relationships, suicidal thoughts and alcoholism. He has disowned his 2002 album, The Younger I Get, as the too-raw ramblings of what he calls a &quot;decrepit Drake. &quot; On December 1 2010, Glover released the first track off of his EP titled Be Alone. He released the next track, Freaks and Geeks, as well as a five-song track list, on February 11.

The band was formed in 2006 and originally had three members: Brian Sella (vocals, guitar, lyricist), Brian Uychich (keyboard, vocals) and Matt Uychich (drums). However, as of fall 2010, Brian Uychich left the band to concentrate on school full-time. Brian Uychich was replaced by Drew Villafuerte (bass, keys) In June 2010, The Front Bottoms released a 6-track album entitled &quot;Slow Dance to Soft Rock&quot;. On March 8th, 2011, the band announced they have completed work on their forthcoming new mini-album, &quot;Grip &#x27;N&#x27; Tie&quot;.

He is the founder and current CEO of Aftermath Entertainment and a former co-owner and artist of Death Row Records, also having produced albums for and overseeing the careers of many rappers signed to those record labels. As a producer he is credited as a key figure in the popularization of West Coast G-funk, a style of rap music characterized as synthesizer-based with slow, bass heavy beats. Dr. Dre began his career in music as a member of the World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru and he later found fame with the influential gangsta rap group N. W. A, which popularized the use of explicit lyrics in rap to detail the violence of street life. His 1992 solo debut The Chronic, released under Death Row Records, led him to become one of the best-selling American performing artists of 1993. In 1996 he left Death Row to found his own label Aftermath Entertainment, producing a compilation album, Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath, in 1997 and releasing a solo album titled 2001 in 1999. During the 2000s he focused his career on production for other artists, while occasionally contributing vocals in other artists&#x27; songs. Rolling Stone named him among the highest-paid performers of 2001 and 2004. Dr. Dre also had acting roles in the 2001 films The Wash and Training Day. In 2011, his final solo studio album, Detox, is set to be released following much delay and speculation. Early life The first child of Verna and Theodore Young, Dr. Dre was born as Andre Romelle Young on February 18, 1965. His mother was only 16 years old at the time of his birth, after being impregnated by teenage boyfriend Theodore, whom she later married. Young&#x27;s middle name, &quot;Romelle&quot;, came from Theodore Young&#x27;s unsigned, amateur R&amp;B singing group The Romells. In 1968 his mother divorced Theodore Young for another man, Curtis Crayon, and had other children with him, including two sons named Jerome and Tyree (both of whom are now deceased) and daughter Shameka. As a young child, Young was fascinated with vinyl records spinning on phonographs; his family&#x27;s record collection included many popular R&amp;B albums of the 1960s and 1970s, from such singers as Diana Ross, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, his mother Verna found R&amp;B music to be a relief from the two jobs she had to work daily. Despite economic troubles, she continued to encourage Young not to give up in life. During Verna&#x27;s second marriage, Young and his step-brother Tyree were raised primarily by their grandmother and Curtis Crayon, as their mother spent much time in search of work. In 1976 Young began attending Vanguard Junior High School and had a new sister named Shameka. However, due to gang violence around Vanguard, he transferred to nearby Roosevelt Junior High School. Verna later married Warren Griffin, whom she met at her new job in Long Beach, which added three new stepsisters and one new stepbrother to the family. The stepbrother, Warren Griffin III, would eventually become a rapper under the stage name Warren G. Young attended Centennial High School in Compton during his freshman year in 1979 but transferred to Fremont High School due to poor grades. On December 15, 1981, Young fathered a son with Lisa Johnson, however Curtis Young was not brought up by his father and they only met when Curtis had become rapper Hood Surgeon about 20 years later. He was nearly enrolled to an apprenticeship program at Northrop Aviation Company until poor grades at school made him ineligible. Therefore, he focused on social life and entertainment for most of his high school years. Music career World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru (1984-1985)  Main article: World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru Inspired by the Grandmaster Flash song &quot;The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel&quot;, he often attended a club called The Eve After Dark to watch many DJs and rappers performing live. Thus, he became a DJ in the club, initially under the name &quot;Dr. J&quot; based on the nickname for Julius Erving, his favorite basketball player. At the club, he met aspiring rapper Antoine Carraby, later to become member DJ Yella of his group N. W. A. Soon afterwards he adopted the moniker Dr. Dre, a mix of previous alias Dr. J and his first name, referring to himself as the &quot;Master of Mixology&quot;. He later joined the musical group World Class Wreckin&#x27; Cru under the independent Kru-Cut Records in 1984. The group would become stars of the electro-hop scene that dominated early 1980s West Coast hip hop, and their first hit &quot;Surgery&quot; would prominently feature Dr. Dre on the turntables and sell 50,000 copies within the Compton area. Dr. Dre and DJ Yella also performed mixes for local radio station KDAY, boosting ratings for its afternoon rush-hour show The Traffic Jam. Due to the amount of time Dr. Dre was spending on his rap music he frequently skipped school, affecting his education. His absences also jeopardized his position as a diver for his school&#x27;s swim team. However, when he did attend he received good grades in certain classes. After high school, he attended Chester Adult School in Compton following his mother&#x27;s demands for him to get a job or go to school. After brief attendance at a radio broadcasting school, he relocated to the residence of his father and residence of his grandparents before returning to his mother&#x27;s house. He later dropped out of Chester to focus on performing at the Eve&#x27;s After Dark nightclub. N. W. A and Ruthless Records (1986-1991)  Main article: N. W. A Music sample: &quot;Fuck Tha Police&quot; Play sound from Straight Outta Compton Problems listening to the file? See media help. In 1986 he met rapper Ice Cube, who collaborated with Dr. Dre to record songs for Ruthless Records, a rap record label run by local rapper and drug dealer Eazy-E. N. W. A however, along with fellow west coast rapper Ice T, debuted with rhymes including profanity and gritty depictions of crime and life on the street. No longer constricted to racially charged political issues pioneered by rap artists such as Public Enemy or Boogie Down Productions, N. W. A shot out with hardcore and realistic perspective of street violence and local black gangster lifestyle. Propelled by the hit &quot;Fuck tha Police&quot;, the group&#x27;s first full album Straight Outta Compton became a major success, despite an almost complete absence of radio airplay or major concert tours and warnings from the FBI. The FBI sent letters to Arabian Prince, Ice Cube and Eazy-E urging them to stop releasing their music as a response to the large amount of complaints they had received about the group&#x27;s lyrical content and use of expletives. After Ice Cube left N. W. A over financial disputes, Dr. Dre produced and performed for much of the group&#x27;s second album Efil4zaggin. He also produced tracks for a number of other rap acts on Ruthless Records, including Above the Law, and The D. O. C. for the album No One Can Do It Better. In 1991 at a music industry party in Hollywood, he assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, after he felt dissatisfied by a news report of hers on the feud between the remaining N. W. A members and Ice Cube. Thus, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500 and given two years&#x27; probation and 240 hours of community service, as well as a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The Chronic and Death Row Records (1992-1995)  Further information: Death Row Records After a dispute with Wright, Young left the group at the peak of its popularity in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N. W. A lyricist, The D. O. C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Wright release Young from his contract and, using Dr. Dre as his flagship artist, found Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with a rapper whom he met through his own stepbrother and rapper Warren G, Snoop Dogg. Dr. Dre&#x27;s debut album was The Chronic under Death Row Records. Young ushered in a new style of rap, both in terms of musical style and lyrical content. Music sample: &quot;Nuthin&#x27; But a &quot;G&quot; Thang&quot; Play sound from The Chronic Problems listening to the file? See media help. On the strength of singles such as &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot;, featuring protege Snoop Doggy Dogg and hits like &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; and &quot;Fuck wit Dre Day (and Everybody&#x27;s Celebratin&#x27;)&quot; (known as &quot;Dre Day&quot; for radio and television play), The Chronic became a cultural phenomenon, its G-funk sound dominating much of hip hop music for the early 1990s. In 1993 the Recording Industry Association of America certified the album multi-platinum, and Dr. Dre also won the Grammy Award for Best Rap Solo Performance for his performance in &quot;Let Me Ride&quot;. For that year, Billboard magazine also ranked Dr. Dre as the eighth best-selling musical artist, The Chronic as the sixth best-selling album, and &quot;Nuthin&#x27; but a &#x27;G&#x27; Thang&quot; as the 11th best-selling single. Besides working on his own material, Dr. Dre produced Snoop Dogg&#x27;s debut album Doggystyle, which became the first debut album for an artist to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 album charts. Young also produced other West Coast rap albums of Death Row Records, including Dogg Food by Tha Dogg Pound and the album Regulate&#8230;G Funk Era by his stepbrother Warren G. In 1994 Dr. Dre produced the soundtracks to the films Above the Rim and Murder Was the Case and the single &quot;No Diggity&quot; by Blackstreet. He collaborated with fellow N. W. A member Ice Cube for the song &quot;Natural Born Killaz&quot; in 1995. In 1995, just as Death Row Records was signing rapper 2Pac and positioning him as their major star, Young left the label amidst a contract dispute and growing concerns that label boss Suge Knight was corrupt, financially dishonest and out of control. Thus, in 1996, he formed his own label Aftermath Entertainment directly underneath the distributor label for Death Row Records, Interscope Records. Consequently, Death Row Records suffered poor sales by 1997, especially following the death of 2Pac and the racketeering charges brought against Knight. Move to Aftermath Entertainment (1996-1998)  Further information: Aftermath Entertainment The Dr. Dre Presents the Aftermath album, released on November 26, 1996, featured songs by Dr. Dre himself as well as by newly signed Aftermath artists, and a solo track &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;, intended as a symbolic farewell to gangsta rap. Despite being classified platinum by the RIAA, the album was not very popular among music fans. In October 1996 Dr. Dre appeared on the sketch comedy program Saturday Night Live, broadcast on the NBC television network in the United States, to perform &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;. In 1997 Young produced several tracks on Nas, Foxy Brown, AZ, and Nature Present The Firm: The Album; although the album went platinum, it was met with similarly negative reviews from critics. Rumors began to abound that Aftermath was facing financial difficulties. The turning point for Aftermath came in 1998, when Jimmy Iovine, the head of Aftermath&#x27;s parent label Interscope, suggested that Young sign the white Detroit rapper Marshall Mathers, artistically known as Eminem, to Aftermath. Young produced three songs and provided vocals for two on his controversial album, (&quot;My Name Is&quot;, &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; and &quot;Role Model&quot;) in 1999. 2001 (1999-2000)  Main article: 2001 (album) Dr. Dre&#x27;s second solo album, 2001, released in the fall of 1999, was considered an ostentatious return to his gangsta rap roots. It was initially titled The Chronic 2000 to imply being a sequel to his debut album The Chronic but was re-titled 2001 after Death Row Records released an unrelated compilation album earlier in 1999. Other tentative titles included The Chronic 2001 and Dr. Dre. The album featured numerous collaborators, including Devin the Dude, Hittman, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the website All Music Guide described the sound of the album as &quot;adding ominous strings, soulful vocals, and reggae&quot; to Dr. Dre&#x27;s style. The album was highly successful, charting at number two on the Billboard 200 charts and has since been certified six times platinum, thus reaffirming a recurring theme featured in its lyrics, stating that Dr. Dre was still a force to be reckoned with, despite the lack of major releases in the previous few years. The album included popular hit singles &quot;Still D. R. E. &quot; and &quot;Forgot About Dre&quot;, both of which Dr. Dre performed on NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night Live on October 23, 1999. Dr. Dre won the Grammy Award for Producer of the Year in 2000, and joined the Up in Smoke Tour with fellow rappers Eminem, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube that year as well. Music sample: &quot;Still D. R. E. &quot; Play sound from 2001 Problems listening to the file? See media help. During the course of the popularity of 2001, Dr. Dre was involved in several lawsuits. Lucasfilm Ltd. , the film company behind the Star Wars film franchise, sued him over the use of the THX-trademarked &quot;Deep Note&quot;. The Fatback Band also sued Dr. Dre over alleged infringement of its song &quot;Backstrokin&#x27;&quot; in his song &quot;Let&#x27;s Get High&quot; from the 2001 album; Dr. Dre was ordered to pay $1. 5 million to the band in 2003. The online music file-sharing company Napster also settled a lawsuit with him and heavy metal rock band Metallica in the summer of 2001, agreeing to block access to certain files that artists do not want to have shared on the network. Focus on production (2001-present) Following the success of 2001, Dr. Dre focused on producing songs and albums for other artists. He produced the single &quot;Family Affair&quot; by R&amp;B singer Mary J. Blige for her album No More Drama in 2001. Other successful albums that he produced for Aftermath have included the major-label debut album by Queens, New York-based rapper 50 Cent, Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;, in 2003. The album featured the Dr. Dre-produced hit single &quot;In da Club&quot;, as a joint production between Aftermath, Eminem&#x27;s boutique label Shady Records and Interscope. Dr. Dre also produced &quot;How We Do&quot;, a 2005 hit single of rapper The Game from his album The Documentary. Another copyright-related lawsuit came upon Dr. Dre in the fall of 2002, when Sa Re Ga Ma, a film and music company based in Calcutta, India, sued Aftermath Entertainment over an uncredited sample of the Lata Mangeshkar song &quot;Thoda Resham Lagta Hai&quot; on the Aftermath-produced song &quot;Addictive&quot; by singer Truth Hurts. In February 2003, a judge ruled that Aftermath would have to halt sales of Truth Hurts&#x27; album Truthfully Speaking if the company would not credit Mangeshkar. In April 2003 rapper Ja Rule released a mixtape of freestyle raps criticizing Dr. Dre and his associated artists 50 Cent and Eminem. At the Vibe magazine awards show in November 2004, Dr. Dre was attacked by a fan named Jimmy James Johnson, who was asking for an autograph. Johnson, in September 2005, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to stay away from Dr. Dre until 2008. For an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in April 2005, Kanye West praised Dr. Dre as among the greatest performing artists of all time. In November 2006 Dr. Dre began working with Raekwon on his album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx II. He also contributed to the rap albums Buck the World by Young Buck and Curtis by 50 Cent. Other upcoming albums that he is involved with includeThe Reformation by Bishop Lamont, The Nacirema Dream by Papoose, Here I Am by Eve, and L. A. X. by The Game. Among planned but unreleased albums during Dr. Dre&#x27;s tenure at Aftermath have included a full-length reunion with Snoop Dogg titled Breakup to Makeup, an album with fellow former N. W. A member Ice Cube which was to be titled Heltah Skeltah, an N. W. A reunion album, and a joint album with fellow producer Timbaland titled Chairmen of the Board. Detox: Final album  Main article: Detox (Dr. Dre album) Detox is to be Dr. Dre&#x27;s final album. In 2002, Dre told Corey Moss of MTV News that he intended Detox to be a concept album. Work for the album dates back to early 2004, but later in that year he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release. After several delays, the album was finally scheduled to be released sometime in 2008 by Interscope Records, which has not set a firm release date for the album as of September 2007. Producers confirmed to work on the album include Bernard &quot;Focus&quot; Edwards Jr. , Hi-Tek, J. R. Rotem, RZA, Jay-Z, and Warren G. Film career In 2001 Dr. Dre appeared in the movies The Wash and Training Day. A song of his, &quot;Bad Intentions&quot; (featuring Knoc-Turn&#x27;Al) and produced by Mahogany, was featured on The Wash soundtrack. Dr. Dre also appeared on two other songs &quot;On the Blvd. &quot; and &quot;The Wash&quot; along with his co-star Snoop Dogg. In February 2007 it was announced that Dr. Dre would produce dark comedies and horror films for New Line-owned company Crucial Films, along with longtime video director Phillip Atwell. Dr. Dre announced &quot;This is a natural switch for me, since I&#x27;ve directed a lot of music videos, and I eventually want to get into directing. &quot; Musical influences and style Dr. Dre has said that his primary instrument in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he uses as many as four or five to produce a single recording. He cites George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, &quot;I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I&#x27;d rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. I can control it better. &quot; Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. After founding Aftermath Entertainment in 1996, Dr. Dre took on producer Mel-Man as a co-producer, and his music took on a more synthesizer-based sound, using fewer vocal samples (as he had used on &quot;Lil&#x27; Ghetto Boy&quot; and &quot;Let Me Ride&quot; on The Chronic, for example). Mel-Man has not shared co-production credits with Dr. Dre since approximately 2002, but fellow Aftermath producer Focus has credited Mel-Man as a key architect of the signature Aftermath sound. In 1999 Dr. Dre started working with Mike Elizondo, a bassist, guitarist, and keyboardist who has also produced, written and played on records for female singers such as Poe, Fiona Apple and Alanis Morissette, for his album 2001. Elizondo has since worked for many of Dr. Dre&#x27;s productions. Dr. Dre also told Scratch magazine in a 2004 interview that he has been studying piano and music theory formally, and that a major goal is to accumulate enough musical theory to score movies. In the same interview he stated that he has collaborated with famed 1960s songwriter Burt Bacharach by sending him hip hop beats to play over, and hopes to have an in-person collaboration with him in the future. Work ethic Dr. Dre has stated that he is a perfectionist, and is known to pressure the artists with whom he records to give flawless performances. In 2006 Snoop Dogg told the website Dubcnn. com that Dr. Dre had made new artist Chauncey Black re-record a single bar of vocals 107 times. Dr. Dre has also stated that Eminem is a fellow perfectionist, and attributes his success on Aftermath to his like-minded work ethic. A consequence of this perfectionism is that some artists that initially sign deals with Dr. Dre&#x27;s Aftermath label never release albums. In 2001, Aftermath released the soundtrack to the movie The Wash. featuring a number of Aftermath acts such as Shaunta, Daks, Joe Beast and Toi. To date, none have released full-length albums on Aftermath and have apparently ended their relationships with the label and Dr. Dre. Other noteworthy acts to leave Aftermath without releasing albums include King Tee, 2001 vocalist Hittman and 1980s rap icon Rakim. However, over the years word of other collaborators has surfaced. During his tenure at Death Row Records, it was alleged that Dr. Dre&#x27;s half brother Warren G and Tha Dogg Pound member Daz made many uncredited contributions to songs on his solo album The Chronic and Snoop Doggy Dogg&#x27;s album Doggystyle (Daz received production credits on Snoop&#x27;s similar-sounding, albeit less successful album Tha Doggfather after Young left Death Row Records). It is known that Scott Storch, who has since gone on to become a successful producer in his own right, contributed to Dr. Dre&#x27;s second album 2001; Storch is credited as a songwriter on several songs and played keyboards on several tracks. In 2006 he told Rolling Stone:  &quot;At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something,&quot; Storch says. &quot;He needed a fuel injection, and Dr. Dre utilized me as the nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I&#x27;d be on the keyboards, and Mike was on the bass guitar, and Dr. Dre was on the drum machine&quot;. Current collaborator Mike Elizondo, when speaking about his work with Young, describes their recording process as a collaborative effort involving several musicians. In 2004 he claimed to Songwriter Universe magazine that he had written the foundations of the hit Eminem song &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, stating, &quot;I initially played a bass line on the song, and Dr. Dre, Tommy Coster Jr. and I built the track from there. Eminem then heard the track, and he wrote the rap to it. &quot; This account is essentially confirmed by Eminem in his book Angry Blonde, stating that the tune for the song was composed by a studio bassist and keyboardist while Dr. Dre was out of the studio but later programmed the song&#x27;s beat after returning. Furthermore, in the September 2003 issue of The Source, a group of disgruntled former associates of Dr. Dre complained that they had not received their full due for work on the label. A producer named Neff-U claimed to have produced the songs &quot;Say What You Say&quot; and &quot;My Dad&#x27;s Gone Crazy&quot; on The Eminem Show, the songs &quot;If I Can&#x27;t&quot; and &quot;Back Down&quot; on 50 Cent&#x27;s Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;, and the beat featured on Dr. Dre&#x27;s commercial for Coors beer. Although Young studies piano and musical theory, he serves as more of a conductor than a musician himself, as Josh Tyrangiel of Time magazine has noted:  Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine in a room full of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work. ) He&#x27;ll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound. &quot;My greatest talent,&quot; Dre says, &quot;is knowing exactly what I want to hear. &quot; Although Snoop Dogg retains working relationships with Warren G and Daz, who are alleged to be uncredited contributors on the hit albums The Chronic and Doggystyle, he states that Dr. Dre is capable of making beats without the help of collaborators. It should be noted that Dr. Dre&#x27;s prominent studio collaborators, including Scott Storch, Elizondo, Mark Batson and Dawaun Parker, have shared co-writing, instrumental, and more recently co-production credits on the songs where he is credited as the producer. It is also widely acknowledged that most of Dr. Dre&#x27;s raps are written for him by others, though he retains ultimate control over his lyrics and the themes of his songs. As Aftermath Producer Mahogany told Scratch: &quot;It&#x27;s like a class room in . He&#x27;ll have three writers in there. They&#x27;ll bring in something, he&#x27;ll recite it, then he&#x27;ll say. &#x27;Change this line, change this word,&#x27; like he&#x27;s grading papers. &quot; As seen in the credits for tracks Young has appeared on, there are often multiple people who contribute to his songs (although it should be noted that often in hip hop many people are officially credited as a writer for a song, even the producer). As a member of N. W. A, The D. O. C. wrote lyrics for him while he stuck with producing. Popular rapper Jay-Z ghostwrote lyrics for the single &quot;Still D. R. E. &quot; from Dr. Dre&#x27;s album 2001.

In 1991 the couple had a son, Marcel. In May 1996 Dr. Dre married Nicole Threatt, who was formerly married to NBA player Sedale Threatt. Dr. Dre and Nicole have two children together: a son named Truth (born 1997) and a daughter named Truly (born 2001). He is also the biological father of rapper Hood Surgeon (real name Curtis Young), impregnating his mother, Lisa Johnson, at 16 when he was 17. Income In 2001, Dr. Dre earned a total of about $52 million from selling part of his share of Aftermath Entertainment to Interscope Records and his production of such hit songs that year as &quot;Family Affair&quot; by Mary J. Blige. Rolling Stone magazine thus named him the second highest-paid artist of the year. Dr. Dre was ranked 44th in 2004 from earnings of just $11. 4 million, primarily from production royalties from such projects as albums from G-Unit and D12 and the single &quot;Rich Girl&quot; by singer Gwen Stefani and rapper Eve.

Their unique blend of metal with beautiful melodies, psychedelic moments and a strong undercurrent of classic / hard rock comes as varied and at times appealingly bizarre as the landscapes of their native Iceland. Their fifth full-length &quot;Otta&quot; is the logical continuation of the musical course this four-piece adopted on the highly acclaimed forerunner &quot;Svartir Sandar&quot; (2011). Expect the unexpected, such as seduction by subtle strings or a hypnotic banjo. None of this was apparent when SOLSTAFIR released their album debut &quot;I Blodi og Anda&quot;, which translates as &#x27;In Blood and Spirit&#x27; in 2002. Instead of today&#x27;s Icelandic gravel throated siren chants, frontman Adalbjorn Tryggvason spit forth vitriolic crust-like vocals and the ripping guitars were clearly black metal inspired. Yet the band was as clearly identifiable back then as now and along their way with the next albums &quot;Masterpiece of Bitterness&quot; (2005) and &quot;Kold&quot; (2009) introducing new elements in a continuous evolution. SOLSTAFIR&#x27;s music is as much the product of Arctic blizzards as of red hot volcanic magma, erupting geysers, lush green pastures, and salty waves. With &quot;Otta&quot; the Icelanders touch something ancient and timeless, while defying easy categorisation. This album needs to be heard again and again to peel back layers of details, each different and yet always revealing the same: great songs - all of them. The song titles of &quot;Otta&quot; form a concept based on an old Icelandic system of time keeping similar to the monastic hours called &quot;Eykt&quot; (&quot;eight&quot;). The 24 hour day was divided into 8 parts of 3 hours each. The album starts at midnight, the beginning of &quot;Lagnaetti&quot; (&quot;low night&quot;), continues through each Eyktir of the day and ends with &quot;Nattmal&quot; (&quot;nighttime&quot;) from 21:00 to 0:00. This form of time keeping is more open than the relentless ticking of modern times, where each second is made to count, which turns humanity into cocks of the corporate clockwork. Now SOLSTAFIR give you the antidote. Just lean back, close your eyes, take your time and lose yourself in this masterpiece called &quot;Otta&quot;!", "Andra Day": "", "Stereolab": "Stereolab are a UK-based band whose style, mixing 1950s-1960s pop and lounge music with the &quot;motorik&quot; beat of krautrock, was one of the first to which the term &quot;post-rock&quot; was applied. They are noted for the use of vintage keyboard instruments like Moog synthesizers and Vox and Farfisa organs. Stereolab is also notable for founding their own record label, Duophonic Records, with a grant from UK charity The Prince&#x27;s Trust. The band is often referred to as &quot;The Groop&quot; by their fans (and in the title of their song &quot;The Groop Play Chord X&quot; on the album Space Age Batchelor Pad Music). They were founded in 1990 by songwriters Tim Gane (guitar, keyboards), formerly of the band McCarthy, and Laetitia Sadier (sometimes credited as Seaya Sadier; vocals, keyboards, trombone, guitar), who is from France and sings in both English and French. Over the years, Gane and Sadier have enlisted a large number of other musicians to accompany them on stage and on record. The initial line-up featured Martin Kean, formerly of The Chills, on bass, and Joe Dilworth (from their Too Pure label-mates Th&#x27; Faith Healers) on drums, with Russell Yates (of Moose) and Mick Conroy (ex-Modern English) also appearing at early live shows. In 1993 they recruited Andy Ramsay (drums), who has remained in the group line-up ever since, and Mary Hansen (vocals, guitar, keyboards, percussion). Hansen&#x27;s distinctive backing vocals became an important aspect of the Stereolab sound, and she remained a regular feature of the line-up until her death in a cycling accident on December 9, 2002. Multi-instrumentalist Sean O&#x27;Hagan of The High Llamas has also been a frequent contributor, particularly with string, brass and keyboard arrangements to the band&#x27;s studio albums. John McEntire (Tortoise) has also contributed keyboard, electronic effects and studio help over the years. Other members have come and (in some cases) gone over the years, including Duncan Brown, Dave Pajo (from Tortoise), Richard Harrison and Simon Johns (all bass); Gina Morris (vocals); and Katharine Gifford and Morgane Lhote (both on keyboards). Early Stereolab material displayed a heavy influence of krautrock sounds, particularly Neu! and Faust, characteristically relying on droning, repetitive guitar or keyboard riffs, with or without vocals. Early heavy use of distorted Farfisa combo-organ sounds were also reminiscent of early recordings by The Modern Lovers. As the band developed, they incorporated new instrumentation, and an increasingly complex sense of rhythm and structure, frequently making use of irregular time signatures as well as unorthodox chord progressions and melodic intervals. The band has often made copious use of female backing vocal lines. Lyrically, Stereolab&#x27;s music is quirky (song titles evoke memories of 1950s science fiction stories, and are often borrowed directly from old films and records of the period, but have nothing to do with the song&#x27;s content), but highly politically and philosophically charged, sometimes with a decidedly Surrealist or Situationist bent. (Sadier notes the libertarian Marxist theoretician Cornelius Castoriadis as a particular inspiration. ) Sadier&#x27;s lyrics, in both French and English, often read like highly condensed sociological texts, standing in deliberate and distinct counterpoint to the lush hedonic pop sound of the band. A prime example would be &quot;Ping Pong&quot; from Mars Audiac Quintet, which is an explicit restating of Marxist theory concerning the relationship between economic cycles and war cycles. Stereolab earned a minor place in the Britpop movement, with their sound proving influential to bands like Blur: occasional keyboard-driven b-sides and singer Damon Albarn&#x27;s love of retro keyboards showed the influence, and in recognition Laetitia Sadier was invited to provide vocals on &quot;To The End&quot; from Parklife. Despite the band&#x27;s fan base and critical acclaim, Stereolab has not achieved high levels of financial or popular success. On June 7, 2004, suits at the Warner Music label (to whom the band was signed in the US) announced they were dropping Stereolab in response to the poor sales (40,000 to that date) of Margerine Eclipse. This was part of an ongoing effort by Warner to cut costs; The Breeders and Third Eye Blind were also dropped from the label for this reason. Laetitia Sadier is now also a member of Monade, which is essentially expressive of her own singular musical goals.

He is signed to Virgin Records but released his Betty and The Selfish Sons EP on his own Pacemaker Records label in 2007.

Although at the time of writing Jamie has received relatively little mainstream exposure, he has received airplay from BBC Radio 1 DJ Zane Lowe, who made &quot;Salvador&quot; his single of the week and &quot;Back In The Game&quot; his Hottest Record In The World. In January 2007 Jamie also covered Zane&#x27;s show on radio 1 whilst Zane was away, working alongside Radio 1 DJ Nihal. On Jo Whiley&#x27;s show, &quot;Back In The Game&quot; featured as her &quot;pet sound&quot; and more recently his single Sheila was Whiley&#x27;s Record Of The Week.

Jamie&#x27;s no stranger to internet bootleggers, there&#x27;s also a naughty &#x27;Demos&#x27; album hanging around on the world wide highway containing alternative and live performances. On March 1, 2007, Treays was voted as Best Solo Artist at the NME Awards, at Hammersmith Palais in London, England. He held off more established names like Thom Yorke &amp; Jarvis Cocker, to receive the award. Jamie T is currently working on his second album with a few track titles being released; including &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot;, &quot;Spiderwebs&quot;, &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, &quot;368&quot;, &quot;Jilly Armeen&quot;, &quot;British Intelligence&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Young Professionals&quot;, &quot;Man&#x27;s Machine&quot;, &quot;Earth, Wind &amp; Fire&quot;, &quot;Emily&#x27;s Heart&quot; and &quot;Bruce&quot;.

On January 12th 2009, a music video appeared on Jamie&#x27;s website for a new song, &quot;Fire Fire&quot;. The track has elements of Jamie&#x27;s trademark sound but incorporates faster rhythms, a punk aesthetic and a more abrasive sound than previous singles. Jamie T has said to NME &quot;&#x27;Fire Fire&#x27; won&#x27;t be released as a single nor will it be on the new album, it&#x27;s just a thank you for the fans being so patient. &quot; He did announce a date for his new single though, The &#x27;Stick &#x27;N&#x27; Stones&#x27; EP which is to be released June 29th. May 21st saw the release of the official video for his latest single &quot;Sticks &#x27;N&#x27; Stones&quot;.

We just finished shooting a little video for the track the other day, so fresh out the edit room it is here for your enjoyment. It was a lot of fun to make and we hope you like it. Hope to see you all soon. . . . . Thanks Jamie\".

", "Demi Lovato": "Demetria Devonne &quot;Demi&quot; Lovato (born August 20, 1992 in Albuquerque, United States) is an American singer, songwriter, philanthropist, and actress. In 2002, she made her debut as child actress in Barney &amp; Friends. In 2008, she came to prominence as a starring cast member in the television film Camp Rock. She signed to Hollywood Records the same year, and released her debut studio album, Don&#x27;t Forget, in September 2008. The album sold 89,000 copies within its first week, debuting at number 2 on the Billboard 200 It has since been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales of over 530,000. In 2009, Lovato was commissioned her own television series, Sonny with a Chance. That July, her second album, Here We Go Again, became her first to debut atop the U. S. Billboard 200, selling 108,000 copies in its first week and spawning the single of the same name which became her first to break the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 15. After the release of additional television films and their accompanying soundtracks in 2010, Lovato&#x27;s personal struggles sent her acting career into hiatus, and saw the closure of her television show Sonny with a Chance after its second season. She released her third album, Unbroken, in September 2011. The album addresses several of her difficulties, notably her lead single &quot;Skyscraper&quot; which became her first single to be certified platinum by the RIAA. The second single, &quot;Give Your Heart a Break&quot;, was later certified double-platinum in the United States. The album had been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. Since 2012, Lovato has served as a judge and mentor on the American version of The X Factor.

", "Spice Girls": "Spice Girls were an English girl group, formed in 1994 and primarily successful between the summer of 1996 and the autumn of 2000. As a five-piece, the Spice Girls became the best selling and most successful girl group of all time, releasing two multi-platinum albums, &quot;Spice&quot; and &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, scoring six consecutive UK #1 hits (9 #1 hits - including 2 double A-side singles -, one #2 hit and a Top 20 Comeback Single, in a total of 11 singles), and appearing in their own motion picture, video game, Pepsi, Polaroid and Impulse commercials as well as grossing millions of dollars in band merchandising alone. Estimated combined album sales are 65 million copies worldwide. In May 1998, during the the &quot;Spice World Tour,&quot; Geri &#x27;Ginger Spice&#x27; Halliwell announced she was leaving the group. &quot;Viva Forever&quot;, released in July 1998, was the final UK #1 hit for Geri Halliwell with the Spice Girls (as of date). Subsequently, the Spice Girls went on as a quartet, releasing three UK #1 singles (&#x27;Goodbye,&#x27; &#x27;Holler,&#x27; &#x27;Let Love Lead the Way&#x27;) without Halliwell from the platinum album, &quot;Forever. &quot; The brief 2007 reunion saw Halliwell return to the band. The &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; package included the new single &quot;Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)&quot;, which only went to #11 in the UK Top 40. The only other Spice Girls single not to go to #1 in the UK was &quot;Stop&quot;, which was held of the top spot by the Jason Nevins remix of Run DMC&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Like That&quot;. As of 2008 the Spice Girls have no plans to produce new material, although the five members are working together on the &quot;Viva Forever&quot; Project &ndash; their West End, jukebox musical. Extended biography In March 1994, advertisements were placed in The Stage newspaper asking: &quot;R U 18-23 with the ability to sing/dance? R U streetwise, ambitious, outgoing and determined?&quot; Hundreds of girls responded to the ads. The applicants were whittled down to a final five which consisted of Melanie Chisholm (Melanie C), Geri Halliwell, Melanie Brown (Melanie B), Victoria Adams (Victoria Beckham) and Michelle Stephenson, who combined to form an all female group called &quot;Touch. &quot; In June, during the group&#x27;s earliest recording session, Michelle Stephenson was forced to leave due to commitment issues. She was replaced by Emma Bunton after Bunton&#x27;s singing tutor had recommended her to the other girls. From this point up to March 1995 the girls lived together in a small house in Maidenhead where they worked on demos and practiced dance routines. After a successful showcase performance for music critics and producers in October, the group decided to fire their original management, who they cited as controlling and too domineering. That same day, the girls tracked down Sheffield-based producer Eliot Kennedy and persuaded him to work with the group (by then renamed Spice) over the course of the next year. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, the group began touring management agencies. The group was introduced to record producers Absolute, who in turn brought them to the attention of Simon Fuller of 19 Management. The girls began a relationship with Fuller and finally signed with him in March 1995. During the summer of that year the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles and finally signed a deal with Virgin Records in September 1995. From this point up to the summer of 1996, the Spice Girls (as they were then known) continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of America, where they had signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific. On July 8, 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single wannabe in the United Kingdom. In the weeks leading up to the release, the video for &quot;Wannabe&quot; (directed by Jhoan Camitz and shot in April at St Pancras Station in London), had dominated the music channels. In July 1996 the group conducted their first interview, at Virgin Records&#x27; London HQ with Paul Gorman, contributing editor of music industry paper Music Week. His piece recognised that the Spice Girls were about to institute a change in the charts away from Britpop and towards out-and-out pop. He wrote: &quot;Just when boys with guitars threaten to rule pop life an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group has arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble!!&quot;. The song entered the charts at number 3 before moving up to number 1 the following week and staying there for 7 weeks. The song proved to be a global hit - hitting number 1 in 31 countries and became not only the biggest selling single by an all female group, but also the biggest selling debut single of all time. &quot;Wannabe&quot; also proved to be a catalyst in helping the Spice Girls break the notoriously difficult U. S. market when it debuted on the Hot 100 Chart at number 11. At the time, this was the highest ever debut by a British (or non-American) act in the US, beating the record previously held by The Beatles for i want to hold your hand at number 12. In November 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut album, spice in Europe. The success was unprecedented and drew comparisons to Beatlemania (it was dubbed &quot;Spicemania&quot;) due to the sheer volume of interest in the group. In just 7 weeks, spice had sold 1. 8 million copies in Britain alone, making the Spice Girls the fastest selling British act since The Beatles. In total, the album sold over 3 million copies in Britain and peaked at number 1 for 15 weeks. In Europe, the album became the biggest selling album of 1997 and was certified 8x Platinum by the IFPI for sales in excess of 8 million copies. In the United States, spice became the biggest selling album of 1997, peaking at number 1 and being certified 7x Platinum (for sales of over 7 million) by the RIAA. Riding a wave of publicity and hype, the group followed the single &quot;Wannabe&quot; up quickly by releasing say you&#x27;ll be there in October and 2 become 1 in December. The two tracks continued the group&#x27;s remarkable sales by topping the charts in over 53 countries and cementing the group&#x27;s reputation as the biggest pop act on the planet. The last release from spice was a double A-side of mama / who do you think you are which once again saw them at number 1. In November 1997, the Spice Girls released their second studio album, spiceworld . Preceded by the single spice up your life, the album proved to be an instant global best seller. It set a new record for the fastest selling album over 2 weeks when it shipped 7 million copies. Gaining favourable reviews, the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe, Canada, and the United States alone. Criticized in America for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there and suffering from over-exposure at home, the Spice Girls began to experience a media backlash. The group were criticized for the amount of sponsorship deals they signed - over 20 in total - and they began to witness diminishing international chart positions. Nevertheless, the Spice Girls remained the biggest selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998. Further singles released from the album included too much, stop and viva forever - with stop being the only track not to hit number 1 in Britain (it entered and peaked at number 2). In June 1997, the group began filming their movie debut, &quot;Spiceworld: The Movie&quot;, with Absolutely Fabulous and Fawlty Towers director Bob Spiers. Meant to accompany the album, the comical style and content of the movie was in the same vein as The Beatles&#x27; films in the 1960s such as &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The light-hearted comedy, intended to capture the spirit of the Spice Girls, starred a plethora of stars including Roger Moore, Elton John, Jennifer Saunders, Richard E. Grant and Meat Loaf. Released in December 1997, &quot;Spiceworld: The Movie&quot; proved to be a big box office hit taking nearly $30 million in the US, PS11 million in Britain, and over $70 million worldwide. The movie was not as popular with critics however; it was nominated for seven awards at the 1999 Golden Raspberry Awards where they &quot;won&quot; the award for &quot;Worst Actress&quot;. On November 7, 1997 the Spice Girls fired their manager and mentor Simon Fuller. According to their various autobiographies, it was mainly Geri and Melanie B who pushed for Fuller's dismissal. They cited that he had become too controlling by restricting their personal and artistic freedom, and they accused him of using divide and rule tactics to get his own way. The group quickly found the burden of managing themselves time consuming, so they assigned various responsibilities to each member of the group. They later built their own team, headed by Nancy Phillips, to deal with their affairs. In early 1998, the Spice Girls embarked upon a sell-out 102 date world tour covering Europe and North America. The &quot;Spiceworld&quot; tour kicked off in Dublin, Ireland on February 24, 1998 before moving onto mainland Europe and then returning to Britain for 14 gigs at Wembley Arena and Birmingham's NEC Arena. It was here that recordings were made for a planned live album, which was confirmed by the group: &quot;We&#x27;ve shown everyone we can do the business on stage, so now we want to do a live album for fans&quot;. Despite masters of the recording being made, the idea was eventually dropped. At the end of the European leg of the tour, Geri Halliwell missed the final 2 shows in Oslo, Norway reportedly due to gastroenteritis. However, rumours quickly circulated that Geri had become disenchanted with the group and was planning to leave - and after she also missed a performance of viva forever on the National Lottery show, rumours began to intensify. On May 31, 1998, Geri Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls. Through her solicitor, she issued the following statement: &quot;Sadly I would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls. This is because of differences between us. I&#x27;m sure the group will continue to be successful and I wish them all the best&#8230; PS, I&#x27;ll be back. &quot; Halliwell claimed that she was suffering from exhaustion and wanted to take time out. However, rumours persisted that she had fallen out with one of the other girls (reportedly Melanie B). Although this has never been confirmed, the biographies of Victoria Beckham, Geri Halliwell, and Melanie B all hint that this was the case. Geri's departure from the group shocked fans and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year, making news headlines the world over. The four remaining girls were adamant though that the group would carry on and that their approaching North American tour would continue as normal. Geri Halliwell&#x27;s departure threw most of the group&#x27;s plans into disarray. It was cited as the reason the planned live album was cancelled. It also meant that most of the material the girls had recorded throughout the first half of 1998 at Dublin&#x27;s Windmill Lane Studios with long time collaborators Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe was eventually scrapped. A rumoured animated venture by Disney also failed to materialize. The Spice Girls first release as a foursome was viva forever the last single taken off spiceworld . The video for the single was made before Geri&#x27;s departure and features the girls in animated form - a decision made because there was no time to produce a video due to the heavy world tour schedule. Originally planned as a double A-side with never give up on the good times the idea was dropped for several reasons, mainly due to time restraints (since there was no time to re-record and edit out Geri&#x27;s vocals or make a video for the track). Whilst on tour in America the group continued to record new material and they released the new song goodbye at Christmas 1998. Written before her departure, the song was nevertheless seen as a tribute to Geri and when it topped the British chart it became their third consecutive Christmas number 1 - equalling the record previously set by The Beatles. The song also became one of the most successful songs of the 1990&#x27;s in Canada, where it stayed at number 1 for 16 weeks. In November 2000 The Spice Girls released their new album, forever . Sporting a new edgier R&amp;B sound, the album received a lukewarm response and achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best selling predecessors. In the US it peaked at number 39 on the Billboard Top 200. In the UK, the album was released the same week as Westlife's coast to coast album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media. In the end Westlife, who had embarked on a massive promotional tour, outsold The Spice Girls by a margin of 3 to 1 to take the top spot. The lead single from the album, the double A-side holler / let love lead the way, did have some success - it became the group&#x27;s ninth number 1 single in the UK. However, the song failed to break onto the Billboard Hot 100, instead peaking at number 7 on the Bubbling Under chart. However, holler did peak at number 31 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play in 2001. Many credit the low success of the album down to the fact the group did very little promotion in the run up to its worldwide release. The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2000, and a few TV performances aside, the group did little meaningful promotion. In an attempt to cover more ground, the girls split up and covered different countries separately; for example Victoria and Emma headed to America while Melanie B and C concentrated on Europe. Further planned single releases off the album never materialised. Promo singles of tell me why, weekend love and if you wanna have some fun came into circulation but the forever project was abandoned in early 2001 as the girls each began to concentrate on solo careers. In the years since, the media speculated endlessly about possible reunions. On June 28th 2007, the Spice Girls (including Geri Halliwell) reformed and gave a press conference to announce a tour plus a greatest hits CD, and a documentary that were both released by the end of the year. A new single was released on the 19th November 2007 called Headlines (Friendship Never Ends) to moderate acclaim. Their 2007-08 reunion tour however was sold out across the world but despite this success the group wrote a message on their website in March 2008 to confirm that this reunion tour really was the end of the Spice Girls. The group reformed in 2012 for a one-off performance at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London. 2) Heavy metal band from Vrbas, Serbia.

She gained fame for her role as Miley Stewart/Hannah Montana on the Disney Channel sitcom Hannah Montana, which began in 2006 and ended in 2010. Cyrus recorded music for the soundtracks Hannah Montana (2006) and Hannah Montana 2/Meet Miley Cyrus (2007), released by Walt Disney Records, which helped establish her as a teen idol. In 2007, Cyrus signed to Hollywood Records for a solo career. She went on the Best of Both Worlds Tour the same year; the tour was eventually turned into a high-grossing concert film entitled Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert (2008). In April 2008, Cyrus released her first solo album, Breakout (2008), which experienced international success and she was included in Time magazine&#x27;s 2008 Top 100. She began her foray into films by providing the voice of &quot;Penny&quot; in the animated film Bolt (2008) and by reprising the role of Miley in Hannah Montana: The Movie (2009). Bolt&#x27;s theme song, &quot;I Thought I Lost You&quot;, earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. Hannah Montana: The Movie&#x27; soundtrack introduced her to new audiences within country and adult contemporary markets. She began to cultivate an adult image in 2009 with the release of The Time of Our Lives (2009), an extended play which presented a more mainstream pop sound, and by filming The Last Song (2010), a coming-of-age drama film. The former included Cyrus&#x27;s best-selling single, &quot;Party in the U. S. A. &quot; (2009). Cyrus ranked number twenty-nine on Forbes&#x27; 2009 Celebrity 100. An upcoming studio album titled Can&#x27;t Be Tamed will be released in 2010 and presents a new dance-pop sound. The music video and lyrics of the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Can&#x27;t Be Tamed&quot;, portrays a more sexualized image for the entertainer. Cyrus has stated that she intends to focus on acting rather than singing in the future. ", "You Me at Six": "You Me At Six are a 5-piece pop punk band from Weybridge, Surrey who formed in 2005. The five piece played locally until early 2007 when spring support slots with Saosin at Leeds Cockpit (03. 05. 07) and later Paramore at the Colchester Arts Centre (10. 06. 07) saw them attract media attention from the likes of Kerrang, Musicscoop and NME.

", "The Maine": "The Maine is an American rock band from Tempe, Arizona, USA that formed on January 21, 2007. The band&#x27;s first release, the EP Stay Up, Get Down was released in late 2007, followed by a five song EP entitled The Way We Talk released on December 11, 2007. The band&#x27;s first full-length album, Can&#x27;t Stop, Won&#x27;t Stop was released July 8, 2008. Their holiday release &#8230;And a Happy New Year was dropped on December 2008. The Maine released its second full-length album, Black &amp; White, on July 13, 2010 selling 22,634 copies in its first week. On December 6, 2011, the group&#x27;s third album, Pioneer, was released and it peaked at No. 90 on the Billboard 200. Their latest full-length record Forever Halloween was released on June 4, 2013 reaching No. 39 on the Billboard 200 selling over 10,000 copies in its first week. The Maine was created by bassist Garrett Nickelsen and drummer Patrick Kirch in November 2006. Singer John O&#x27;Callaghan joined soon after auditions for the band with no prior vocal experience, along with musicians Ryan Osterman and Alex Ross. Together, they collectively released the EP Stay Up, Get Down. Shortly thereafter Ryan and Alex departed the band for unknown reasons, but were replaced with Kennedy Brock and Jared Monaco. The Maine signed to Fearless Records and debuted with a five song EP entitled The Way We Talk in 2007. ", "Neutral Milk Hotel": "Neutral Milk Hotel is an American indie rock band formed by singer, guitarist, and songwriter Jeff Mangum in the early 1990s. On the band&#x27;s two full-length albums, Mangum played with a number of other musicians, notably Jeremy Barnes (drums), Scott Spillane (horns), Julian Koster (musical saw/banjo/accordion/bass guitar) and producer-instrumentalist Robert Schneider. Neutral Milk Hotel was one of the original members of the Elephant Six Collective , based in Athens , Georgia . They have been on an indefinite hiatus since 1998 and since then developed an increasing cult following within the indie-music scene with Jeff Mangum enjoying almost legendary status. Origins Jeff Mangum was a member of The Olivia Tremor Control, along with his friend Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss, appearing on their first release, the California Demise 7&quot;. Prior to recording for friends under the NMH moniker, Mangum recorded at least one cassette under the name Milk: the only known tape was called Pygmie Barn in E Minor . This is the earliest known recordings that Mangum initiated and executed himself, on the cover there is &quot;all songs: j. m &#x27;89. art: w. cullen hart&quot;. There is only an estimated dozen or so copies ever made of this tape, none of which have been made public. The tracklist etc. are also unknown. Neutral Milk Hotel began life in Ruston, Louisiana, United States in the early 1990s, simply as a recording project for Mangum. He produced several demo cassettes, among them 1991&#x27;s Invent Yourself a Shortcake , 1992&#x27;s Beauty and 1993&#x27;s Hype City Soundtrack , along with two more from this period, seemingly unnamed. Although easily found on the internet, these demos capture the project at a very embryonic state: songs are played in between various sound collages and tape experiments, and even, at one point, a six minute conversation between Mangum and Hart. During this period, Mangum was wandering the country, staying in the closets of friends, and in a state of permanent unemployment. It was in these circumstances that the band&#x27;s first formal releases took shape. Strictly speaking, however, the &#x27;band&#x27; usually consisted of Mangum and whoever else was present at the time. This is obvious on Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s first release, a 7&quot; entitled Everything Is , recorded when Mangum was spending time in Seattle , Washington, released on Cher Doll Records in 1994. On Avery Island A full album, On Avery Island , followed, this time recorded mainly in Denver , Colorado , where Mangum was backed by Robert Schneider of the Apples in Stereo, Rick Benjamin of the Perry Weissman Three and Lisa Janssen of Secret Square. Merge Records released it in 1996. On On Avery Island , Mangum&#x27;s unique vocal style and the band&#x27;s quirky but playful arrangements create a carnival atmosphere of moods ranging from excitement, suspense, and melodrama. After the release of On Avery Island , Neutral Milk Hotel became a fully-fledged band, as Julian Koster, Scott Spillane and Jeremy Barnes joined Mangum, the band now being based in New York . Soon after this, they moved to Athens , Georgia , where many of Mangum&#x27;s friends had begun to settle, and the Elephant 6 recording company began, fully, to take shape. After this, the band went back to Denver, to record a proper follow up to On Avery Island . In the Aeroplane Over the Sea The band&#x27;s second LP, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea , released in 1998, is notable as a critically acclaimed work and a widely popular recording. It is a spiritually motivated work, conceptually based on the beauty to be found in the horrific fate of Anne Frank and similarly overwhelming tragedies. (Mangum has, during live performances, including the one released under the title &quot; Live at Jittery Joe&#x27;s &quot;, described some of the songs off this album as based on urgent, recurring dreams he had of a European family during the 1940s. ) The album was highly praised by critics for its wildly inventive instrumentation and Mangum&#x27;s provocative and impassioned lyrics. Although it met with scant response from the general public when it was released, the recording has continued to gain momentum in indie music circles and has become a cult classic, selling well over 100,000 copies according to Merge Records. However, the record along with the year of constant touring that succeeded it took its toll on Mangum. The band quite abruptly went on hiatus turning down all requests for shows, including a support slot for R. E. M. . All of a sudden, the band appeared to go silent and very little has been heard from Mangum since 1999. Hiatus Although all the members are still active with one another in other projects, it is unknown whether any more Neutral Milk Hotel albums will be released. There were plans to release a Neutral Milk Hotel rarities album on the Orange Twin label; however, after an announcement in 2005 on the Orange Twin website claiming that Jeff Mangum had in fact eventually decided against the project, it is unclear if this will ever happen. There has been, however, some activity since In the Aeroplane Over the Sea . First, Orange Twin re-released Everything Is&#8230;. , complete with extra bonus tracks, as well as Live at Jittery Joe&#x27;s , a bootleg recording of a show Mangum played in a coffee house in Athens in 1997. The Major Organ and the Adding Machine album, a rather secretive project released by Orange Twin in 2001 and consisting mainly of experimental musical collage, features Mangum, along with Julian Koster, Of Montreal&#x27;s Kevin Barnes, Elf Power&#x27;s Andrew Reiger and the Olivia Tremor Control and Circulatory System&#x27;s Will Cullen Hart and Eric Harris. There was also the release of Orange Twin Field Works, Vol. 1 , Mangum&#x27;s field recording of a Bulgarian folk festival, also on Orange Twin in 2001. Additionally, he plays drums on the first Circulatory System album. Since the start of the hiatus Neutral Milk Hotel, Jeff Mangum has only played live properly again once, under the pseudonym &#x27;World of Wild Beards, Inc. &#x27;, at the Kings Arms pub in Auckland , New Zealand, at the request of the Tall Dwarfs&#x27; Chris Knox. He has also made appearances with Elf Power, and appeared onstage at the first of The Olivia Tremor Control&#x27;s New York shows on their 2005 reunion tour, to sing briefly. Further releases from Neutral Milk Hotel, however, are indicated to be unlikely. The other members are all still releasing or recording material: Julian Koster as The Music Tapes, Scott Spillane as The Gerbils and Jeremy Barnes as A Hawk &amp; A Hacksaw, Bablicon and Marta Tennae. In 2005, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea saw its re-release by Domino Records in the UK , in a sleeve featuring praise from, among others, Franz Ferdinand and The Arcade Fire, both very much influenced by the band. On Avery Island was re-released in the US in January of 2006 with live bonus tracks. Mangum has also been fairly busy creatively - following a charity auction on eBay of an acoustic guitar decorated by Mangum himself, more guitars hand-decorated by Mangum were sold via Orange Twin Records for $900 apiece. In addition, a number of Mangum&#x27;s original drawings, this time costing only $10 each, were sold via Neutral Milk Hotel&#x27;s website. In 2013, the band announced a reunion tour of the United States, Australia, Taiwan and Japan. ", "Dam-Funk": "Known as Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;ambassador of boogie funk,&quot; DaM-FunK represents the citizens of the Funkmosphere. Headquartered in the Culver City section of L. A. , DaM (pronounced &#x27;dame&#x27; as in Damon) spent the last few years cultivating a musical renaissance rooted in the early-80&#x27;s styles known as boogie, modern soul and electro-funk. As a DJ/selector, DaM-FunK attracts the most discerning boogie funk aficionados within driving distance of his storied Monday-night Funkmosphere parties. But it&#x27;s not just collectors at the bar toasting to the melodic sounds. Anyone who grooves to the likes of Slave, Aurra, early Prince, Prelude Records and the like, will get a dose of those groups&#x27; unknown contemporaries - more obscure but equally funk-worthy. The next phase of the ambassador&#x27;s mission: continuing the classic West Coast tradition into today&#x27;s scene with DaM&#x27;s own original &quot;modern-funk&quot; compositions. By plugging in his arsenal of vintage synths and drum machines, DaM channels the galactic harmonies of his inspiration into his own brand of new boogie. Stones Throw Records&#x27; like-minded honcho Peanut Butter Wolf brought DaM on to the team to glide into the future with his unique, synth and bass-driven vibe. It&#x27;s a promising new chapter for Southern Cali space funk. ", "Ride": "Ride is a shoegaze / alternative rock band that formed in 1988 in Oxford, England, consisting of Andy Bell, Mark Gardener, Laurence Colbert, and Steve Queralt. The band were initially part of the shoegaze scene that emerged in England during the early 1990s. Their debut album Nowhere (1990) has been named one of the greatest albums of the genre. Following the break-up of the band in 1996, members moved on to various other projects, most notably Bell who became the bassist for Oasis. In 2001, the band members briefly reunited for a one-off performance for a television show. On November 18th, 2014, the band announced their official reunion with tour dates in 2015. Starting out (1988-1989) Andy Bell and Mark Gardener had been to Cheney School in Oxford, appearing in the school&#x27;s musical theatre productions, and in October 1988, they moved to Banbury to do Foundation Studies in Art &amp; Design at North Oxfordshire College and the Oxfordshire School of Art &amp; Design. There they met Laurence Colbert. Steve Queralt, who also went to Cheney School, was recruited from the local Our Price record shop where he worked as a singles buyer (although Bell and Queralt had already played together in an obscure reggae/pop band called &quot;Big Spiderback&quot;). After considering various names, the band settled for &#x27;Ride&#x27;, with its evocation of travel, and after the Ride cymbal. Bell has cited a performance by The Smiths as the inspiration for forming a band. The band formed in the summer of 1988 and played their first gig as Ride for the College&#x27;s Christmas Party towards the end of the year. While still at Banbury, the band produced a demo tape, recorded in Queralt&#x27;s bedroom and hallway, including the tracks Chelsea Girl and Drive Blind. Queralt and his record shop boss and future Ride manager Dave Newton had started a live music night in Oxford called Local Support, and it was due to a cancellation by another band that Ride got their first proper gig at one of these nights. Jim Reid of The Jesus and Mary Chain heard a copy of the demo that was in the possession of the DJ Gary Crowley, and this led to interest from Mary Chain manager Alan McGee. After the band supported The Soup Dragons in 1989, McGee signed them to his Creation Records label. Early Creation years (1989-1993) Ride released three EPs between January and September 1990, entitled Ride, Play and Fall. All three EPs made it into the UK top 75, with Play and Fall reaching the top 40. Ride&#x27;s top-75 placing was a first for Creation Records. The first two EPs were released together as Smile in the USA in July 1990 (and later released in the UK in 1992), while the Fall EP was incorporated into the CD version of their first album, Nowhere, released in October 1990. The band were often labelled as part of the &quot;shoegazing&quot; scene, but the band rejected this, Bell stating &quot;my first reaction was like, this is another boring tag. These days&#8230;that&#x27;s pretty much still my reaction. &quot; Gardener said of the band&#x27;s influences: &quot;We liked the noisy bands of the time. When we were at art college we went to see My Bloody Valentine, The House of Love, The Stone Roses and Sonic Youth. I think these all had a lot of influence on us in the early days as they were great gigs. \" The band recorded two sessions for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show in 1990, and their popularity with the show&#x27;s listeners saw them with three tracks in the Festive Fifty that year, with Dreams Burn Down and Like a Daydream at numbers 3 and 4 respectively, and Taste at number 25. Nowhere was a critical and commercial success, reaching No. 11 in the UK, and the media dubbed Ride &quot;the brightest hope&quot; for 1991. Demand for new material was high, and the band recorded another EP, Today Forever, released in March 1991. The EP marked a change in direction for the group away from the noisier early style. Ride made their first international tour to Japan, Australia and France later on that year. Tickets for the performances in Japan sold out within minutes. In February 1992 the band broke into the UK top 10 with Leave Them All Behind, and the following month saw the release of the band&#x27;s second album Going Blank Again. The strain within the band was already apparent, Bell stating &quot;by the time the second album came out we were touring too much. We were tired. We then took time off, but it was too much time off. \" Change in musical direction (1994-1996) Ride were able to see out 1993 riding on the success of Going Blank Again and a third LP was keenly anticipated. A double weekend of gigs with The Charlatans that year (&#x27;Daytripper&#x27;) kept them in the public eye amid a wider lack of interest in the shoegazing scene. Their third LP, Carnival of Light, was released in June 1994, at a time when Britpop was the focus of the music press. Produced by John Leckie and partly engineered by Nigel Godrich (future Radiohead producer) - except How Does it Feel to Feel? by Black Crowes producer George Drakoulias - and featuring a guest appearance on keyboards from Jon Lord of Deep Purple, the album was split between songwriters Gardener and Bell, with the former&#x27;s songs making up the first half of the album and the latter&#x27;s the second. Opening with the riff-heavy Moonlight Medicine, tracks also include From Time to Time, Birdman and a cover of The Creation&#x27;s How Does It Feel to Feel?, which was released as a single. The album was not well received by critics, Bell explaining &quot;these were good times but the music took second place. When we recorded the Carnival of Light album we got indulgent. &quot; By the end of 1994 even the band themselves were critical of the album, referring to it within the group as &quot;Carnival of Shite. &quot; The breakup (1996) 1995 saw the dissolution of the band while recording Tarantula. Gardener and Bell had led the band away from their shoegazing roots to become more contemporary, hoping to change their style with the times. Queralt has remarked that the band had two future directions open to them, and they chose the wrong option. Gardener had become interested in dance music, and wanted Ride to incorporate that into their style, while Bell disagreed. The track listing of Carnival of Light gives an indication of the tension that was mounting between the two guitarists, with the first half of the album being songs written by Mark Gardener and the last half of the album being songs written by Andy Bell - Andy Bell had refused to let his songs be interspersed with pieces written by Gardener. Years later Andy Bell explained &quot;imagine an argument where the way you win, is by saying &#x27;I don&#x27;t want my songs on the same side of the album as yours&#x27; and it ACTUALLY HAPPENS. We were allowed by the people around us to behave like total babies. &quot; By the time Tarantula appeared, the band was beginning to self-destruct. Bell penned most of the songs while Gardener provided only one - the tension within the band leading to an inability to write meaningful musical pieces. Castle on the Hill, written by Bell, was a lament for the band&#x27;s situation and contains references to Gardener&#x27;s self-imposed exile from the group. Gardener walked out during the album&#x27;s mixing sessions, and the band announced their break-up shortly before its release in March 1996. The album was released and remained on sale for one week before being withdrawn. Critics and fans alike had panned the album (although the first single off the album, Black Nite Crash, was awarded &quot;single of the week&quot; by weekly music magazine Melody Maker). The album was described by Allmusic as &quot;an abomination of &#x27;70s/Lenny Kravitz cliches, full of third- and fourth-rate tunes and, ultimately, bad blood,&quot; going on to say &quot;the words are just plain awful throughout, not even worth printing. &quot; Rolling Stone were more complimentary, stating &quot;the album is saved from maudlin self-obsession because it&#x27;s rawer and rocks harder than anything else Ride have recorded. &quot; Since the break-up, both Bell and Gardener have been more reflective about the group&#x27;s disintegration, with Bell especially admitting his own part in the process. Post break-up years (1997-2001) After the split, Andy Bell formed a new band called Hurricane No. 1 but this project was permanently dissolved when he was asked to play bass for Oasis after having turned down the opportunity to join Gay Dad. He lived in Stockholm during this period. Mark Gardener and Laurence Colbert joined with Sam Williams to form The Animalhouse. As BMG signings, they were successful in Japan. The band was, however, short lived and split in 2002. Gardener has also toured as a solo artist, while Colbert, Gardener and Bell have played in a Bob Dylan tribute band called The Zimmermen. Queralt appears to have retired from professional music. He spent the years following the break-up working in Oxford, playing 5-a-side football, and raising a family. He is now living in Hammersmith, London. Channel Four and beyond (2001-2013) On 16 October 2001, all four members of Ride agreed to be filmed by Channel 4. The footage was used for the show Pioneers, a documentary on Sonic Youth, and featured a twenty minute improvised jam. The recording of this song, plus two short sound checks, were released in 2002 as Coming up for Air. The interest in this limited release CD caused the band to consider future releases. In late 2002, Ride released a 3-CD box set which is made up of OX4_ The Best of Ride, Firing Blanks_ Unreleased Ride Recordings 1988-95 and Live_Reading Festival 1992. In 2003 they released Waves, a collection of tracks from five radio sessions recorded for the BBC. Mark Gardener started pursuing a solo career. From 2003 to 2005, Gardener toured extensively, sometimes with the help of Oxford friends Goldrush, in order to personally fund a full-length studio album. During the tour, a three-track EP with Goldrush Falling Out Into the Night and a live album (the acoustic solo Live @ the Knitting Factory, New York City) were released. He also spent part of 2005 working with the French duo rinocerose. In late 2005, Gardener&#x27;s album These Beautiful Ghosts was released in North America on United For Opportunity. Any thoughts of permanently re-forming the band, however, have been explicitly denied by Bell, with the reasoning that it would not live up to expectations. However, the members, Bell included, have stated that they would not mind working with each other again. Since, Bell and Colbert made an appearance at one of Gardener&#x27;s early shows; Bell later shared two nights of acoustic sets with Gardener in November 2003 when Gardener made a tour stop in Bell&#x27;s current home of Stockholm. Colbert has also started playing in a band again - as guitarist and vocalist. He also plays drums in different projects, most notably with the reformed The Jesus and Mary Chain, Supergrass (filling in for Danny Goffey), International Jetsetters with fellow Jesus and Mary Chain bandmate Mark Crozer, and Damo Suzuki (Can). In 2005, Gardener was stuck in France and unable to play the Truck Festival; Colbert&#x27;s band filled the gap in the bill. Colbert studied on the 1 Year Diploma in Drum Performance at London&#x27;s Drumtech after the split of Ride. Reunion (2014-present) On November 18th, 2014, it was announced that Ride officially reunited again, and will perform a series of tour dates in Europe and North America in May and June 2015.

Initially the vocalist of post-hardcore band Million Dead, Turner embarked upon a primarily acoustic-based solo career following the band&#x27;s split in 2005. To date, Turner has released five solo albums, two rarities compilation albums, one split album and five EPs. Turner&#x27;s fifth studio album, Tape Deck Heart was released on 22 April 2013. Frank Turner started solo acoustic shows prior to Million Dead&#x27;s break up. The first official performance was at the first Small Town America all dayer at 93 Feet East on September 18th 2004. The solo performances were, in a sense, a sideline to Million Dead. They did allow Turner to display some of his own songwriting capabilities (without a band) as well as some covers of songs and bands he enjoyed, in some cases the songs were much re-worked to fit an acoustic atmosphere. Solo performances were also used to help bolster or expose Million Dead to new individuals as well, with some acoustic in-store and radio performances of Million Dead songs. At the end of February and start of March (2006) Frank went to Oxford to record the &quot; Campfire Punkrock &quot; EP with Dive Dive as the backing band for three of the songs. This EP was released on May 15 2006 on a limited run through Xtra Mile recordings. It sold out after only a few weeks on sale and had to be re-pressed to meet demand. With Jonah Matranga doing some touring in June 2006 in support of his CD/DVD album &quot; Jonah Matranga &quot; there was some discussion of Frank doing supports with Jonah, this only ended up with one show featuring both at The Peel in Kingston. The discussion however lead to the creation of the Jonah Matranga and Frank Turner split 12&quot; vinyl. Released in the USA on Welcome Home Records and in the UK via Xtra Mile Recordings. The release features Frank covering two songs by American songwriters and Jonah covering two songs by British songwriters. He was recently (September 18 2006) the last ever artist to perform on BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Lamacq Live program, unveiling two new songs from &quot; Sleep Is For The Week &quot;. The good sales of &quot; Campfire Punkrock &quot; meant good news as this allowed Frank to record his debut album &quot; Sleep Is For The Week &quot; in August and September 2006. Recorded in Oxford with Dive Dive as extra band on a selection of the 13 tracks. The last track, &quot; The Ballad Of Me And My Friends &quot;, is a live recording from a sold out show at the London Barfly and features the vocal contribution of the (approximately) 200 strong audience during a verse. Those in attendance and gave their names to Xtra Mile Recordings will have their names credited as contributers to this track. In April 2008, his second album Love, Ire and Song was released to critical acclaim. His third full-length album, Poetry Of The Deed, was released September 7th 2009, and includes the singles The Road, Try This At Home and Isabel. An accompanying DVD, Take To The Road, was released in March 2010. Amidst extensive touring in support of Poetry of the Deed, Turner and his then-untitled backing band recorded Rock &amp; Roll, an EP consisting of tracks written at the same time as Poetry of the Deed alongside new material. Following its release, Turner and the band spent twenty days in January 2011, recording their next studio album with producer Tristan Ivemy. The result was England Keep My Bones, the fourth studio album by Frank, released on June 6, 2011, on Xtra Mile in the United Kingdom, and on June 7, 2011, on Epitaph Records worldwide. Preceded by the single, &quot;Peggy Sang the Blues&quot;, the album was produced and mixed by Tristan Ivemy, who had previously mixed Love, Ire and Song, Rock &amp; Roll and Campfire Punkrock. The album&#x27;s title is taken from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play, The Life and Death of King John, with Turner noting, &quot;I knew that the album was, for the most part, about mortality, and about Englishness. Shakespeare seemed like a good place to go hunting for some pearls of wisdom, and with a little help from my friend Ben we came across this one, and it just seemed to fit the work really well. &quot; Following the completion of the album, Turner subsequently announced his backing band had named themselves The Sleeping Souls, after a lyric in the track, &quot;I Am Disappeared&quot;. The Sleeping Souls are Nigel Powell, Ben LLoyd, Tarant Anderson and Matt Nasir. Turner recorded his fifth studio album in Burbank, California, in October 2012. The reason for recording first time abroad in California was, that producer Rich Costey wouldn&#x27;t come to England with all his equipment so he convinced Turner to record it in Burbank. Frank Turner announced via Twitter on 28 October 2012 that recording was completed, and mixing and mastering would be done in time for a March 2013 release date. During the November and December UK tour a free CD titled Good Hangs from Xtra Mile Recordings was distributed for free at Frank Turner shows, this included a yet-to-be-released Turner song titled &quot;Tattoos&quot; plus the Mongol Horde song &quot;Casual Threats From Weekend Hardmen&quot;. On Christmas Day 2012, the song &quot;Four Simple Words&quot; was released on Xtra Mile Recordings&#x27; website as a free download along with the b-side &quot;Cowboy Chords&quot;. On 4 January 2013, a video was shot for what would be the first single. On the same day Frank announced on Twitter that the single was the song &quot;Recovery&quot;. On 9 January, Frank uploaded a photo to his Instagram page showing the names of all 13 songs that would feature on his new album. This included songs played during the UK and US tours of 2012 such as &quot;Anymore&quot;, &quot;Plain Sailing Weather&quot;, &quot;We Shall Not Overcome&quot; and &quot;Tell Tale Signs&quot;. Frank also posted on his fan forum that an extended edition of his new album would be released that includes an extra 5 or 6 songs. On 19 February 2013, it was announced that Turner had signed a licensing deal with Interscope Records in the US for Tape Deck Heart. Following the release of the album Frank Turner embarked on a short U. K tour.

From time to time he would stand in for a singer of a local rock band when the guy had to go to the bathroom during a show. A musician in another saw Chorao performing during these bathroom breaks and invited him to join his band. When the bassist of that band quit, Chorao found Champignon who was twelve at the time. Later on, Chorao decided to start his own band, and invited Champignon and Pelado (Chorao&#x27;s friend from another local band), and then Marcao and Thiago (a 5th member). The band would continue to have shows in the city without an official name until Chorao crashed his car in a coconut shack that was named &quot;Charlie Brown Jr. &quot; Producer Rick Bonadio, who Champignon knew, invited them to make a &quot;demo&quot; and he liked what he heard. Virgin Records signed the band after hearing their demo. In 1997, they released their debut album Transpiracao Prolongada Continua (&quot;Long, Continuous Transpiration&quot;, reference to the hard work).

", "Grimes": "Grimes is the alias of the electronic musician Claire Boucher (born in 17 March 1988 in Vancouver, Canada and based in Montreal). Her music is an eclectic mix of styles which she described herself as &quot;ADD music&quot;, because it shifts frequently and dramatically. She fuses contemporary instrumentation with classical vocal practices. Boucher was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia. She graduated from Lord Byng Secondary School and studied ballet for 11 years. In 2006, she moved to Montreal, Canada to attend Montreal&#x27;s McGill University, studying Russian literature and later, neuroscience. During her studies, she began to record and perform under the name Grimes. While in Montreal, she began attending concerts put on by local experimental musicians at Lab Synthese, a performance space located in an abandoned textile factory. She stopped going to McGill and decided to pursue her long life dream of becoming an electronic musician. She was taught how to make music by other students who were so desperate for food, they offered to teach her in return for some grub. YUM! Her first release was the album Geidi Primes , issued on cassette in 2010 by Arbutus Records. It was followed in the same year by the sophomore album Halfaxa , through Arbutus Records. In 2011, Grimes released a split album with d&#x27;Eon titled Darkbloom . In January 2012, she had signed with record label 4AD. In February 2012, Grimes released her third studio album, Visions . The album incorporates influences as wide as Enya, TLC and Aphex Twin, drawing from genres like New Jack Swing, IDM, New Age, K-pop, Industrial and glitch. Visions was met with critical acclaim and featured on many Best Albums of 2012 lists. The Guardian named Visions the second best album of 2012, calling it &quot;a masterpiece in gonzo pop that is weird, original and derivative at the same time&quot;. The NME ranked the album at number two on its 50 Best Albums of 2012 list, while naming her best known songs &quot;Oblivion&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot; the sixth and sixteenth best tracks of 2012, respectively.

Lewis rose to prominence in 2006 as the winner of the third series of the British television series The X Factor . Lewis has become a multi-platinum selling artist and three time Grammy Award nominee. She was proclaimed &#x27;Top New Artist&#x27; by Billboard magazine in 2008. Her two albums Spirit and Echo, released in 2007 and 2009 respectively, have collectively sold in excess of 10 million copies worldwide and topped the charts in numerous countries. Lewis&#x27;s debut tour, The Labyrinth, took place in 2010. As of December 2012, Lewis has sold 28 million records worldwide. Her third album Glassheart was released 12 October 2012. It was preceded by the single &quot;Collide&quot;, which became her seventh top-five hit in the UK. With the release of Hurt: The EP and &quot;Trouble&quot;, Lewis has had nine top-ten hits in the UK. Lewis&#x27; debut single A Moment Like This became the fastest selling UK single after being downloaded over 50,000 times within thirty minutes of its release. Her second single, Bleeding Love, reached number one positions in over thirty singles charts around the world. In November 2008 she set a record in the UK for the fastest selling download-only release with her cover version of the Snow Patrol song Run which sold 69,244 copies in two days. Lewis&#x27;s debut tour, The Labyrinth, started in 2010. Lewis was born in the London Borough of Islington, to Aural Josiah &quot;Joe&quot; Lewis of Afro-Guyanese descent, and Maria Lewis of Welsh, Italian and Irish descent. Her parents enrolled her at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, and from there she attended the Italia Conti Academy and the BRIT School, where she learned to play instruments such as the guitar and piano, in the hope of becoming a singer-songwriter. Lewis wrote her first full-length song at the age of 12. She initially trained in opera, but went on to singing jazz and blues, eventually leading to popular music, citing Minnie Riperton, Eva Cassidy and Stevie Wonder as her main influences. After leaving the BRIT School at 17, she took a number of jobs to fund studio time, recording a demo album called Twilight. The album, almost exclusively comprising her own compositions, was recorded under Spiral Music, a production company based in Fulham. &quot;I tried to secure a record deal by doing things my own way. I worked very hard but I never managed to land a contract&quot;, said Lewis. Other demos were recorded under licence from UEG Entertainment, later included on an album called Best Kept Secret. However, none of Lewis&#x27;s demos were released and she considered taking a hiatus from her music career to attend university until her boyfriend persuaded her to enter The X Factor which subsequently severed her connections with UEG. Songfacts says that Collide, the first single from Leona Lewis&#x27;s third album finds her taking a more dance pop route than on her previous material. She said, &quot;I&#x27;m excited for people to see a different side to my music. I&#x27;m a fan of so many different genres and styles. For me this song has all the great ingredients of a summer anthem. &quot; The song got its first play on Scott Mills&#x27; Radio One show on July 15, 2011 and will be released on September 4, 2011. Lewis&#x27; third studio album, Glassheart , is due for release in 2012. ", "In Flames": "In Flames is a Swedish metal band from Gothenburg, formed in 1990. The band's earlier work is considered to be a major influence on the melodic death metal music genre, although they have changed styles into a more alternative metal sound on more recent albums. Since the band's conception in 1990, they have received numerous awards and released ten studio albums and one live DVD. The band has enjoyed increased popularity in recent years, both in its native Sweden and internationally. As of 2008, In Flames has sold over two million records worldwide. ", "City and Colour": "City and Colour is the recording alias for Canadian singer-songwriter Dallas Green, who was also the guitarist and vocalist of the \tSt. Catharines, Ontario-based post-hardcore band Alexisonfire. He plays melodic acoustic/folk music, and is often accompanied by a rotating number of Canadian indie rock musicians, such as Daniel Romano and Spencer Burton of Attack in Black. The name City and Colour comes from his own name: Dallas, a city, and Green, a colour. His reasoning for the name was that he felt queasy &quot;putting the album out under the name Dallas Green&quot;. Green began releasing City and Colour songs on the Internet for fans to download in 2004. Eventually, he compiled and rewrote several of these songs to make his first album, Sometimes. The full length debut was released on November 1, 2005 to a good reception, described by one reviewer as &quot;dynamically gentle and vulnerable&quot;. The cover art was designed by Scott McEwan, in a tattoo-esque style; Green &quot;still may decide to have some of them inked at a later point in time&quot;. Sometimes was re-released on Vagrant Records on January 13, 2009, which was the first time the album was available in physical form in the United States. Green&#x27;s second album, Bring Me Your Love, was released on February 12, 2008 and features a wide array of instruments not used on his previous recordings (such as harmonica, banjo, drums and lap steel) giving it a more folk-influenced sound. The album also features collaborations with other musicians, such as Canadian musician Gordon Downie of The Tragically Hip on the track &quot;Sleeping Sickness&quot;, and additional instrumentals done by Matt Sullivan and the members of Attack in Black. The lead single, &quot;Waiting&#8230;&quot;, was released on Green&#x27;s official MySpace page for the first time featuring a &quot;making of&quot; video. The album is named after a short story by Charles Bukowski. It is also a line sung in the closing track, &quot;As Much As I Ever Could. &quot; On September 26, 2008, City and Colour embarked on their first American tour, in support of Bring Me Your Love. On the tour, the band supported Tegan and Sara along with Girl in a Coma. This tour was followed by a headlining tour of the US in January 2009, with support from William Elliott Whitmore. In October 2008, Dine Alone Records announced a special 2-disc limited edition of Bring Me Your Love to be released on December 2, 2008. Only 6,000 copies are available; 5,000 in North America and 1,000 in Australia. In Canada, when the record label put up the album on pre-sale on November 20, 2008, so many fans tried to pre-order it that the store&#x27;s website crashed. In January 2010, City and Colour embarked on an additional US headlining tour, again supporting Bring Me Your Love, with supporting act Lissie, and an additional UK tour in June 2010, supporting P!nk, along with Butch Walker, along with a few headlining dates. On these tours, Dallas Green performed two new songs by the titles of &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;Oh Sister&quot;, as well as a couple of never-played-before covers - &quot;Murderer&quot;, originally by Low, and &quot;Grinnin&#x27; In Your Face&quot;, originally by Son House. On February 23, 2011, it was officially announced on the Dine Alone Records website that City and Colour&#x27;s third album would be titled Little Hell and was set for release in June 2011. On March 23, 2011, the official track listing was posted on City and Colour&#x27;s official website. On April 5, 2011, &quot;Fragile Bird&quot;, the first single off Little Hell was released to the radio. The song had its world premiere on Australian radio station Triple J, where the band was touring at the time. The single became City and Colour&#x27;s highest charting single, reaching No. 1 on the Canadian rock/alternative chart. On August 5, 2011, Alexisonfire announced their break-up. George Pettit wrote a message on the band&#x27;s official website saying Dallas had been planning to leave to focus on City and Colour, as balancing the two bands had become too difficult. City and Colour announced the release of the new album entitled The Hurry and the Harm to be released on June 4, 2013. The song &quot;Of Space and Time&quot; was released on March 11, 2013 prior to the announcement of the new album. The song &quot;Thirst&quot; was released on April 1, 2013 on City and Colour&#x27;s Soundcloud page. www. cityandcolour. ca www. myspace. com/dallasgreen", "Lin toshiteShi Yu": "", "Run the Jewels": "Run the Jewels is an American hip-hop duo that consists of emcee/producer El-P and emcee Killer Mike. In 2012, El-P produced Killer Mike&#x27;s critically acclaimed album R. A. P. Music. The following week, Killer Mike appeared on the track &quot;Tougher Colder Killer&quot;, from El-P&#x27;s album Cancer 4 Cure. Both won the acclaim of media and fans across the globe and led to 2012's legendary, hugely successful \"Into The Wild\" tour. One year later, the duo return to satisfy fan demand, and their own creative urges, as Run The Jewels, cementing their musical alliance with a full album of uncompromisingly raw, forward thinking hip-hop. They released their self-titled debut album, Run the Jewels, on June 26 2013, via Fool&#x27;s Gold Records to critical acclaim. Their follow-up record, Run the Jewels 2, was announced in August 2014. It was released through Mass Appeal Records, on October 24, 2014. They also announced the release of a traditional remix album of Run the Jewels 2, which will be released via Fool&#x27;s Gold Records Records in 2015, and a remix album titled Meow the Jewels exclusively featuring &quot;cat sounds&quot; which will see guest production from Prince Paul, The Alchemist, Just Blaze, Dan the Automator, and others. ", "Kylie Minogue": "Kylie Minogue (born May 28, 1968, in Melbourne, Australia) is an Australian pop singer who rose to fame after starring in the Australian TV soap Neighbours . Whilst her cover of The Loco-Motion in 1987 reached the Australian #1 spot, it was the Stock Aitken Waterman &#x27;hit factory&#x27; which produced her first UK chart-topper, I Should Be So Lucky, in 1988. Throughout the late 1980s, Minogue was a phenomenon in both Australia and the UK, and also saw success in Asia and Europe. Minogue went on to have the most number of consecutive UK top ten hits of any new artist. However, she left Stock Aitken Waterman and PWL Studios in 1992 and signed with Deconstruction (through BMG). Her next single, &quot;Confide in Me&quot;, reached number one in Australia and was a hit in several European countries in 1994, and a duet with Nick Cave, &quot;Where the Wild Roses Grow&quot;, brought Minogue a greater degree of artistic credibility. Drawing inspiration from a range of musical styles and artists, Minogue took creative control over the songwriting for her next album, Impossible Princess (1997). Parting ways with Deconstruction, she spent a short time in the musical wilderness before pulling on a pair of gold hotpants and returning to her pop roots with the #1 hit Spinning Around. Her music videos showed a more sexually provocative and flirtatious personality and several hit singles followed. Minogue&#x27;s biggest hit to date is Can&#x27;t Get You Out Of My Head, from the globally successful album Fever . It reached #1 in 40 countries, including the US, a market in which Minogue had previously received little recognition and has sold over ten million copies worldwide. She has become one of the most successful female recording artists in the world with #1 hits spanning three decades, and is considered a national treasure in both the UK and her native Australia. In 2005, midway through her Showgirl: The Greatest Hits Tour , Minogue was diagnosed with early stage breast cancer, causing her to halt the Australian leg of her tour. The news shocked both fans and non-fans alike, and the &#x27;Kylie effect&#x27; was felt by breast cancer charities - both in terms of donations and the upsurge of queries from concerned women of all ages. Through her personal suffering, Minogue had inadvertently increased global awareness of breast cancer issues. After successfully coming through a tough twelve-month battle with the disease, in early July 2006 Minogue announced rescheduled dates of her now renamed Showgirl: The Homecoming Tour - fulfilling her Australian dates with a concert on November 11, 2006 in Sydney, along with extra dates, taking the updated show back to London and Manchester in January 2007. Although now more prominent in music, Minogue makes an occasional return to acting - her most recent project being her well-publicized appearance alongside David Tennant in the Doctor Who Christmas 2007 episode, &quot;Voyage Of The Damned&quot;. On November 12, 2007 Minogue released the single 2 Hearts which reached #4 in the UK chart, and which also peaked at #1 in Australia. The album it was from, X , earned her a BRIT Award nomination for Best International Album. The album saw her collaborate with many writers and producers including the Freemasons and Calvin Harris. The following year, Minogue won the Best International Female Solo Artist award at the 2008 BRIT Awards, and in May also received the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, France&#x27;s highest cultural honor. On December 1, 2008, Coldplay released &quot; Lhuna &quot;, a collaborative project with Minogue, at the launch of the (RED)WIRE(tm) website to mark World AIDS Day 2008. This would be the world premiere of the song. Minogue&#x27;s tenth studio album, X , received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album of 2009. It was her fifth Grammy Award nomination. In 2010,Minogue released her 11th studio album titled Aphrodite ,preceeded by the hit single All the Lovers,one of her most succesful singles to date. With Aphrodite ,Minogue became the first female artist ever to have #1 albums on the UK charts for 4 consecutive decades. In 2011,she embarked on the Les Folies Tour ,which travelled to 5 continents,and was seen by over 600,000 fans worldwide. Minogue made history in the United States for having two songs inside the top three on any U. S. Billboard chart, with her songs &quot;Better Than Today&quot; and &quot;Higher&quot; charting at one and three on the U. S. Hot Dance Club Songs. Minogue is celebrating her 25th anniversary in the music industry in 2012. Timebomb was released by Minogue as a single to coincide with the celebration of the singer's quarter century in the music business. The Timebomb Songfacts reports that the song was dropped on May 25, 2012, two months short of twenty-five years after her debut single, a cover of little Eva's The Locomotion. Minogue also released the compilation album, The Abbey Road Sessions in October 2012. The album contained reworked and orchestral versions of her previous songs. It was recorded at London&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios and was produced by Steve Anderson and Colin Elliot. The album received favourable reviews from music critics and it debuted at number-two in the United Kingdom. The album spawned two singles, &quot;Flower&quot; and &quot;On a Night Like This&quot;. Minogue also starred in two films; a cameo appearance in the American independent film Jack &amp; Diane and a lead role in the French film Holy Motors. Jack &amp; Diane opened at the 2012 Tribeca Film Festival on 20 April 2012, while Holy Motors opened at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival. In January 2013, Minogue and her manager Terry Blamey, whom she had worked with since the start of her musical beginnings, parted ways. The following month, she was signed to Roc Nation for a management deal. Minogue is currently recording on her twelfth studio album since the spring of 2012. The upcoming album is reported to feature works from producers such as Fernando Garibay, Pharrell Williams, Darkchild, Sia, Nervo and Jay-Z. In September, she was featured on Italian singer-songwriter Laura Pausini&#x27;s single &quot;Limpido&quot;, which was a number-one hit in Italy and has received a nomination for &quot;World&#x27;s Best Song&quot; at the 2013 World Music Awards. In the same month, she joined as a coach in the third series of BBC One&#x27;s talent competition The Voice UK for one season, alongside record producer and Black Eyed Peas member, will. i. am, Kaiser Chiefs&#x27; lead singer Ricky Wilson and pop singer Sir Tom Jones. Minogue&#x27;s first episode on the show as a judge aired on 11 January 2014. In November, she was hired as one of the new coaches for the third season of The Voice Australia. In March 2014, Minogue released her 12th studio album, Kiss Me Once. The album featured contributions from Sia Furler, Mike Del Rio, Cutfather, Pharell Williams, MNEK and Ariel Rechtshaid. It peaked at number one in Australia and number two in the United Kingdom. The singles from the album, &quot;Into the Blue&quot; and &quot;I Was Gonna Cancel&quot;, did not chart inside the top ten of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 12 and number 59. In September 2014, Minogue will embark on the Kiss Me Once Tour. She is also set to appear in the upcoming 2015 disaster film, San Andreas alongside Dwayne Johnson. ", "Eels": "Eels is an American alternative/acoustic indie rock band formed by singer/songwriter Mark Oliver Everett, better known as &quot;Mr. E&quot; or simply E. Other members rotate frequently, both in the studio and on stage. Eels were officially founded in 1995 when Jonathan &#x27;Butch&#x27; Norton and E met Tommy Walter. The name &quot;Eels&quot; was chosen so that the band&#x27;s records would be close to E&#x27;s solo records in an alphabetical ordering. In 1996 the band released their debut album Beautiful Freak. Later albums include Hombre Lobo (2009), End Times (2010), Tomorrow Morning (2010). Central band member E (born in 1963) grew up experimenting with music in the Washington D. C. suburbs and later moved to Los Angeles, California, United States emerging as the frontman of a band, calling Eels a vessel for his music. Though other members rotate frequently, both in the studio and on stage, their live shows include interesting interpretations of older songs, and usually some well-known covers. E solo records An album entitled Bad Dude in Love was released in 1985 under the name Mark Everett. Not much is known about the album; all information found is located at eels. nl . In 1992, Everett released his first solo album under the name E titled A Man Called E on Polydor. The single &quot;Hello Cruel World&quot; was a minor success. Touring to support this album, he opened for Tori Amos. A Man Called E was followed by Broken Toy Shop in 1993; that year he was joined on stage by drummer Jonathan &#x27;Butch&#x27; Norton. After Broken Toy Shop E was released from his record deal with Polydor. Beautiful Freak When Butch and E met Tommy Walter, they founded Eels. The main reason for this name was so that the band&#x27;s records would be next to E&#x27;s in an alphabetical ordering. It was only later that they realized that The Eagles and Earth, Wind and Fire would fall in between. They signed a record deal with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Dreamworks, being one of their first bands. In 1996 the band released their debut album Beautiful Freak : a melancholic pop record, where the lyrics of a tormented Everett shine. With the singles &quot;Novocaine for the Soul&quot; and &quot;Susan&#x27;s House&quot; the band had modest international success. They toured extensively to support the album in 1996 and 1997, playing many festivals and building their name as a live act in the United States and Europe. In September 1997, Tommy quit the band (or was fired, depending on who you ask - see the hidden message in the track &quot;Dog&#x27;s Life&quot;). The album demonstrated a wide range of influences, including grunge and hip-hop. Electro-Shock Blues E had a difficult time in his personal life at this point. His father was found dead, his sister had committed suicide just before Beautiful Freak was released, and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. These events inspired him to write Electro-Shock Blues , released in 1998. The lyrics deal with subjects like suicide, death, and cancer. Despite the fact that it is a very dark album, and not nearly as big a commercial success as its predecessor, Electro-Shock Blues is still many fans&#x27; favorite. Contributions to the album were made by Jon Brion, Dust Brother Michael Simpson, and T-Bone Burnett. &quot;Last Stop: This Town&quot; was a minor success as a single; the second single &quot;Cancer for the Cure&quot; was used on the soundtrack for the film American Beauty . Still a three-piece band on stage, Tommy Walter was replaced by Adam Siegel, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies. A large part of the American leg of the tour was canceled after the death of E&#x27;s mother. They returned to Europe later in the year, to open for Pulp. After the tour Adam left the band to focus on his own project, My Head. Daisies of the Galaxy In 2000, the Daisies of the Galaxy album was released, a much happier work. As E puts it, If Electro-Shock Blues was the phone call in the middle of the night that the world doesn&#x27;t want to answer, then Daisies of the Galaxy is the hotel wake-up call that says your lovely breakfast is ready. The album was almost entirely recorded in E&#x27;s basement. E is joined in the studio by Michael Simpson (Dust Brothers), Grant Lee Phillips (Grant Lee Buffalo), and Peter Buck (R. E. M. ). On the tracks &quot;It&#x27;s a Motherfucker&quot; and &quot;Selective Memory&quot;, E plays on the same piano Neil Young used on his classic album After the Goldrush . The first single &quot;Mr. E&#x27;s Beautiful Blues&quot; was co-written by Simpson and features the sound of his pager in the intro. The song was not intended to be on the album, but the record company insisted on its inclusion. Therefore it is not featured on the track listing but listed as &#x27;bonus track&#x27;, separated from the rest of the album by 20 seconds of silence. The song also appeared on the Road Trip soundtrack; some prominent members of the cast from that film feature in the music video. Because of the use of swear words on &quot;It&#x27;s a Motherfucker&quot; and &quot;Mr. E&#x27;s Beautiful Blues&quot; (goddamn right, it&#x27;s a beautiful day) a censored version was released. &quot;It&#x27;s a Motherfucker&quot; was renamed to &quot;It&#x27;s a Monstertrucker&quot;; instances of the &#x27;f-word&#x27; were removed by E singing over them in a distorted voice. To promote Daisies of the Galaxy another tour was planned across the United States and Europe. This time Eels were transformed into an 6-piece orchestra, including Lisa Germano. E also played a few solo shows, opening for Fiona Apple. Oh What A Beautiful Morning In 2000 Eels released an internet only, collection of live tracks a collation of the orchestra tour and the solo shows E played with Fiona Apple. Souljacker In 2001 Souljacker was released, an album with a darker feel than Daisies of the Galaxy . John Parish, previously in PJ Harvey&#x27;s band, co-wrote most of the songs and also played guitar on the album and first part of the tour. Koool G Murder played bass and keyboards and joined Eels on tour, jokingly introduced by E as &#x27;the other guy&#x27;. Wim Wenders directed the video for the first single, &quot;Souljacker Part 1&quot;. After Parish became a father, he was replaced with Joe Gore for the American leg of the Bus Driving, Band Rocking Tour. Electro-Shock Blues Show Electro-Shock Blues Show is a live album by Eels, released in 2002. The fifteen tracks on this album were recorded at six different venues. According to the album&#x27;s liner notes, the first ten tracks were recorded &quot;somewhere in England&quot; during December 1998 while the Eels were a support act for the band Pulp. The other five tracks are brought in from selected performances from around Europe and the United States. The band at the time consisted of E, Butch, and Adam Siegel. The tenth and final track from the English performance features an audience member known simply as &#x27;Emma&#x27; playing the sleigh bells. The last track features a hidden bonus song, another version of &quot;My Beloved Monster&quot;, which follows a long silence after the end of &quot;Climbing To The Moon&quot;. Shootenanny! 2003 marked the release of the album Shootenanny! . E now refers to the album as a break from recording the following Blinking Lights album. It was recorded live in the studio in only ten days. &quot;Saturday Morning&quot; was released as a single. Butch left the band after recording the album to join Tracy Chapman (see ). He was replaced with Puddin. In 2003 Eels did another big tour, The Tour of Duty. The live band then consisted of E, Shon &#x27;Golden Boy&#x27; Sullivan (guitar), Koool G Murder (bass) and Puddin (drums). Golden Boy left to work on his own project Goldenboy and was replaced with Chet Lyster (also known as Chet Atkins III or &#x27;The Chet&#x27;). This year, E also composed the score for the film Levity . Sixteen Tons (Ten Songs) Sixteen Tons (Ten Songs) is a live album recorded by EELS. It was recorded live at the Eels 2003 Tour Of Duty KCRW session. Released in May 2005 during the Eels With Strings tour and sold at their performances, it is now exclusively sold on EELS official website.

Blinking Lights and Other Revelations The new album, called Blinking Lights and Other Revelations , was released on April 26, 2005. This is the band&#x27;s first release for new label Vagrant Records &ndash; an epic 33-track double album. Contributions were made by Tom Waits, Peter Buck and John Sebastian (The Lovin&#x27; Spoonful). A hand-written lyric-sheet to &quot;In the Yard, Behind the Church&quot;, a song from the new album, was sold on eBay for charity. The winning bidder paid $544 for it. The first tour in support of this album, billed as Eels With Strings, featured primarily acoustic guitar-, organ- and piano-based performances by E backed by Alan &#x27;Big Al&#x27; Hunter on piano and upright bass; Chet Lyster on guitar, mandolin, pedal steel, musical saw and drums; and the string quartet of violinists Paloma Udovic and Julie Carpenter, violist Heather Lockie and cellist Ana Lenchantin. The tour resulted in a live album, Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall , recorded in New York City, due to be released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006. Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall is a live album by Eels, released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006.

A mix between a German Shepherd and a Basset Hound, Bobby Jr. was a homeless dog, roaming the streets of Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California until the Los Angeles Animal Control caught him, and he was taken to a dog pound, where Everett eventually &quot;adopted&quot; him. Recently, Bobby Jr. lent his vocals to the Eels song &quot;Last Time We Spoke&quot; on the album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations] (2005). Bobby Jr. can also be seen on assorted Eels merchandise, the official Eels website, and he even has his own MySpace!", "Natalia Lafourcade": "Natalia Lafourcade (born Natalia Lafourcade Silva on 26 February 1984 in Mexico City, Mexico) is a Mexican pop singer and songwriter. In 2005 she released Casa, her second CD, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina (the name of her band). Since she was very young, Natalia had a great interest in music, partly because her parents were musicians. At three years old she began to sing and at four, she realized that she wanted to be an artist. She attended Instituto Anglo Espanol, a Catholic middle school. In her childhood and adolescence she studied painting, flute, theater, music, acting, piano, guitar, saxophone and singing. When she was 10, Natalia sang in a Mariachi group. She lived many years in Coatepec, Veracruz, Mexico, where she studied music with her mother, imitating artists like Gloria Trevi and Garibaldi. In 1998, Natalia was part of an all-girl trio called Twist. Unfortunately, the group was unsuccessful and they split up the next year. Soon after, she began preparing to be a solo artist. When Natalia was 17, Loris Ceroni gave her the opportunity to be in a pop/rock group under his guidance, but when she wasn&#x27;t sure, he encouraged her to go solo. Although LaFourcade didn&#x27;t join the group, Loris Ceroni produced her first LP under the label of Sony Music. It was recorded in Italy and was cowritten with Aureo Baqueiro. Sabo Romo played in 2 songs. Natalia Lafourcade&#x27;s music is a mix of pop, rock, bossa-nova and latin rhythms. It features the songs Busca un Problema, Elefantes, Mirame, Mirate and her biggest hit: En el 2000. In 2003, she was nominated for a Latin Grammy in the Best New Artist category (she lost to David Bisbal) for her debut album. Also, she collaborated on the soundtrack of the Mexican movie Amarte Duele. In 2005 she released Casa, her second CD, but this time as Natalia y La Forquetina (the name of her band). ", "Editors": "Editors are a British indie rock/post-punk revival band from Birmingham, England, formed by Tom Smith (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Russell Leetch (bass) Ed Lay (drums) and Chris Urbanowicz (guitar) who met while studying at Staffordshire University, in Stafford, England, United Kingdom during 2002. After Chris&#x27; departure in 2012 , Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams joined the band for their live gigs and participated in the recording of the fourth album. The band were originally known as (The) Pride, before they changed their line-up and became known as Snowfield, becoming a popular unsigned band. They remained with this name until they signed with Kitchenware Records in September 2004. The band&#x27;s debut single Bullets was released as a limited edition of 500 on Kitchenware Records on January 24, 2005; it quickly gained support from radio stations such as Xfm and BBC 6 Music - where it was the single of the week. Their debut album, The Back Room, was released on 25 July 2005, to critical acclaim. The band toured out most of 2005, including two jaunts with We Are Scientists. However, after a pivotal support slot on Franz Ferdinand&#x27;s Arena tour at the end of 2005, it was the re-release of single Munich in January 2006 that propelled them into the top 10 of the UK single&#x27;s chart. The following May, Editors played three sell-out shows at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy, and countless gigs worldwide. The album has now sold over 500,000 units. In June 2007 Editors released a second album, An End has a Start which included the single Smokers Outside The Hospital Doors. This first track was released on June 18th 2007 in the UK, and June 26th in the US, however it was leaked onto the Internet earlier. The album&#x27;s title track, An End Has A Start was released on September 3rd, The Racing Rats on November 26th, 2007. Following a landmark appearence on The Other Stage at the Glastonbury festival, the album entered at number 1 in the UK album chart. &#x27;In this Light And On This Evening&#x27;, the third studio album, was released on October 12th 2009. With the heavy synthesizer sound and industrial ring, the album differed immensely from the earlier work of the band. Tom explained this change as a way for the band to try something completely different. Papillon, the first single, was followed by You Don&#x27;t Know Love. The third single was Eat Raw Meat = Blood Drool. The album was inspired by the city of London, both lyrically as musically and debuted at number 1 in the UK album charts. On April 16th 2012, during the recording of their fourth studio album with producer Flood, Editors announced that Chris Urbanowicz (guitar) was leaving the band basing the decision entirely upon the band&#x27;s future musical direction. 'The Weight Of Your Love', their fourth studio LP, was released on July 2013. It was preceded by the single &#x27;A ton of love, released in May. This is also the first album to feature new band members Justin Lockey and Elliott Williams. It was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville with producer Jacquire King and mixed by Craig Silvey. http://editorsofficial. com", "Prodigy": "Albert Johnson (born November 2, 1974 in Bradford, Brooklyn, New York), better known by his stage name Prodigy, is a member of the hip hop duo Mobb Deep. Prodigy has been working as a solo artist since the early 2000s. He was born to parents of Ethiopian and Jamaican descent. Prodigy was born with sickle cell anemia and has suffered from the disease throughout his life. Propelled to awareness partially by fellow Queens, New York rapper Nas, who took a similar approach lyrically on his championed &quot;Illmatic&quot; album from 1994, as well as with the aid of a successful single, &quot;Shook Ones Pt. 2,&quot; Mobb Deep suddenly found themselves developing a quickly growing cult. A year later, in 1996, Prodigy and Havoc released &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;; debuting at number six on SoundScan, the album found them fully realizing their approach, dropping both evocative beats and cinematic rhymes that communicated the dark side of New York&#x27;s urban landscape. Thanks to a grim video for &quot;Hell on Earth (Front Lines)&quot; and theatrical Scarface-like photos inside the CD booklet picturing the duo with guns and a mound of cocaine, Mobb Deep had created an elaborate image for themselves that took hardcore gangsta rap to a new level for East Coast hip hop. Their next release, &quot;Murda Muzik&quot;, was heavily bootlegged while still in its demo stage, leaking rough versions of the nearly 30 songs the duo had recorded onto the streets and over the internet. Months after the bootlegs leaked and after several pushed-back street dates, &quot;Murda Muzik&quot; was formally released, debuting at number three on the Billboard charts and quickly going platinum on the strength of &quot;Quiet Storm,&quot; a song that epitomized the Mobb Deep style. The album was welcomed by critics, who again lauded the group&#x27;s lucid cinematics, driven primarily by Havoc&#x27;s production. In late 2000, Prodigy finally released his long-rumoured solo album, &quot;H. N. I. C. &quot;, which saw the more lyrically gifted member of the group collaborating with outside producers such as The Alchemist and Rockwilder on tracks that didn&#x27;t depart far from the trademark sullen Mobb Deep style. Their follow-up, &quot;Infamy&quot;, was the duo's last album for Loud, distributed by Columbia Records and was, for some, a disappointment lyrically and musically, while others praised it as amongst the best rap albums of the year. Loud was absorbed by its new distributor shortly afterwards. Mobb Deep then signed with Jive, under a unique deal that gave the duo its own imprint, Infamous Records, and released &quot;Amerika&#x27;z Nightmare&quot;, a very uneven effort, which featured production by The Alchemist and Lil&#x27; Jon. However, despite a successful single that featured a Thomas Dolby sample. The duo was not happy with Jive, and were let go at its request. The duo took a hiatus afterwards and came back in 2006, signing to 50 Cent's Interscope/Universal-distributed G-Unit imprint. Their well-hyped &quot;Blood Money&quot; was a failure from the money side when compared to fellow label mates like 50 Cent, Young Buck and Lloyd Banks. Some accused the duo of selling out, with their beats and rhymes not up-to-par with previous efforts on Loud. He completed work on his third solo album &quot;H. N. I. C. Part 2&quot;, which was previewed on his official mixtape &quot;The Return of the Mac&quot; on the independent label Koch Records. The mixtape single and mixtape video are called &quot;Mac 10 Handle,&quot; and it shows Prodigy once again reverting to his trademark braids that he had prior to the release of Mobb Deep&#x27;s 2004 &quot;Amerika&#x27;z Nightmare&quot; album; different from the short fade he had from 2004 to 2006. &quot;H. N. I. C. Pt. 2 was released through Voxonic Inc. , of which Prodigy is an equity holder. www. hnic2. com/", "Nouvelle Vague": "At least three different groups have performed under the name Nouvelle Vague : 1) a project created by French musicians Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux and a number of female singers 2) a Japanese pop-R&amp;B band 3) a Berlin-based multimedia music project founded by actress Betty la Gachette and musician &amp; video-editor Renault Schubert. 1) Nouvelle Vague (France) is a project created by French musicians Marc Collin and Olivier Libaux and a number of female singers, including Camille, Alexandra Pavlou of Spring and Suburbia, Melanie Pain, Marina Celeste &amp; Phoebe Killdeer of Phoebe Killdeer and the Short Straws. The group&#x27;s albums consist in bossa nova fashioned covers of (primarily) New Wave songs (hence the name &quot;Nouvelle Vague&quot;). The covers include songs by Dead Kennedys, The Smiths, Joy Division, Public Image Ltd. , Depeche Mode and Bauhaus. Each singer only performed songs they were not previously familiar with, to ensure that each cover would have an individual interpretation. With a name that means &quot;new wave&quot; in English and &quot;nova onda&quot; in Portuguese (which is the meaning for &quot;bossa nova&quot;, a new music &quot;fashion&quot;), Nouvelle Vague&#x27;s moniker neatly sums up the group&#x27;s concept: remaking classic new wave singles with a Brazilian pop twist. Libaux played with various French pop bands during the &#x27;90s and began working with Collin in 1998. For Nouvelle Vague, Collin and Libaux recruited half a dozen French and Brazilian vocalists who were unfamiliar with the original versions of songs like Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;Love Will Tear Us Apart&quot; and XTC&#x27;s &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; to ensure that their renditions had their own identity. Nouvelle Vague was released in Europe in 2004 and received U. S. distribution in spring 2005, which coincided with tour dates in locales as far-flung as Shanghai, New York, Los Angeles, and Rio de Janeiro. Nouvelle Vague&#x27;s second album, Bande a Part, arrived in summer 2006. The following year, the team returned with Coming Home, a collection of songs from films given the Nouvelle Vague treatment. Nouvelle Vague presents New Wave, a collection of covers by new wave artists, also arrived in 2007. One of the singers involved in the project has released solo work as Camille. Official site / MySpace 2) Nouvelle Vague (Japan) is a Japanese band whose pop-R&amp;B sound is beautifully arranged and fronted by the soulful vocals of diva Ricca. Other members of the band include Koyama (keyboards) and Try (bass). 2) Nouvelle Vague (Germany) was a Berlin-based multimedia music project founded by actress Betty la Gachette and musician &amp; videoeditor Renault Schubert. A final decision to change the name was reached in 2004, after french project Nouvelle Vague becomes successful. The new name is: FILM2 Official site", "Marmozets": "Marmozets, averaging a jealousy inducing seventeen years old (c. 2011), sound somewhere in between Be Your Own Pet, Blakfish and the Fall of Troy, and have sprung an EP/Mini Album that is, well, nothing short of brilliant. Fronted by lead singer Becca Macintyre, the band is currently signed to Roadrunner Records. There&#x27;s a fantastic mix of the melodic and the heavy across the record, but not in the formulaic &#x27;singy verse/shouty chorus&#x27; way. It&#x27;s more that there&#x27;s genuine attention to detail into things like dynamics and structure, which is all the more impressive considering the volume of bands a decade their senior that can barely manage it. ", "The Stone Roses": "The Stone Roses are an influential alternative rock band that formed in Manchester, England in 1984. For most of their career, the band consisted of Ian Brown (vocals), John Squire (guitar), Gary &quot;Mani&quot; Mounfield (bass) and Alan &quot;Reni&quot; Wren (drums). Meshing 60s-styled guitar-driven rock with understated 80s dance beats and other influences, the band largely defined the British alternative scene of the late 80s and early 90s. After their eponymous 1989 debut album became an international sensation, countless other groups in the same vein became popular, including The Charlatans, EMF, and the Inspiral Carpets. However, the band was never able to capitalize on the promise of their first album and the whole &#x27;madchester&#x27; scene due to acrimonious conflicts with their label, their manager, and others, waiting five years before they released their second record and slowly disintegrating in the year and half after that album&#x27;s release release. At the very beginning, the Stone Roses emerged from the remains of the artist &quot;The Garage Flowers&quot;, a Manchester-based band formed by schoolmates John Squire (guitar) and Ian Brown (vocals). In 1984, the Stone Roses officially formed as Squire and Brown added drummer Reni (born Alan John Wren), guitarist Andy Couzens, and bassist Pete Garner. The group began playing warehouses around Manchester, cultivating a dedicated following rather quickly. Around this time, the group was a cross between classic British 60s-inspired rock and touches of metal, with perhaps some goth music influence, which gave them a dark yet energetic ethos. Couzens left the group in 1987, being followed shortly afterward by Garner. Garner was replaced by Mani (born Gary Mounfield), and the group recorded its first single, &quot;So Young&quot;, which was released to little attention by Thin Line Records. At the end of 1987, the Stone Roses released their second single, &quot;Sally Cinnamon&quot;, which pointed the way toward the band&#x27;s blend of psychedelic music with hook-laden pop rock featuring ringing guitar riffs. By the fall of 1988, the band secured a contract with Silvertone Records and released &quot;Elephant Stone&quot;, a single that set the band&#x27;s mission of producing catchy neo-psychedelia for both rockers and dancers in stone. Shortly after the release of &quot;Elephant Stone,&quot; the Stone Roses&#x27; bandwagon took off in earnest. In early 1989, the group was playing sold-out gigs across Manchester and London. In May, the Stone Roses released their eponymous debut album, which demonstrated not only a predilection for classic guitar hooks but also a contemporary dance music sensibility. &#x27; The Stone Roses &#x27; received rave reviews and soon a crop of similar-sounding bands appeared in the U. K. By the end of the summer, the Stone Roses were perceived as leading a wave of bands with a similar sound as well as boosting the success of previous groups with that vibe such as the Happy Mondays. &quot;She Bangs the Drums&quot;, the third single pulled from the debut, became the group&#x27;s first Top 40 single at the end of the summer. In November, the group had its first Top Ten hit when &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot; climbed to number eight. By the end of the year, the band had moved from selling out clubs to selling out large theaters in the U. K. The &#x27;madchester&#x27; scene had spread like wildfire. For the first half of 1990, re-releases of the band&#x27;s earlier singles clogged the charts. The group returned in July 1990 with the single &quot;One Love,&quot; which entered the charts at number four. Prior to the release of &quot;One Love,&quot; the Stone Roses organized their own festival at Spike Island in Widnes. The concert drew over 30,000 people and would prove to be their last concert in England for five years, with the Glasgow Green concert being the last gig in the UK for some years. After Spike Island, the Stone Roses became embroiled in a vicious legal battle with Silvertone Records. The group wanted to leave the label but Silvertone took out a court injunction against the group, preventing them from releasing any new material. For the next two years, the band fought Silvertone Records while they allegedly prepared the follow-up to their debut album. However, the Stone Roses did next to nothing as the court case rolled on. In the meantime, several major record labels began negotiating with the band in secret. In March of 1991, the lawsuit went to court. Two months later, the Stone Roses won their case against Silvertone and signed a multi-million deal with Geffen Records. For the next three years, the Stone Roses worked sporadically on their second album, leaving behind scores of uncompleted tapes. During these years, the group kept a low-profile in the press but that wasn&#x27;t to preserve the mystique -- they simply weren&#x27;t doing much of anything besides watching football. Finally, in the spring of 1994, Geffen demanded that the group finish the album and the band complied, completing the record, titled Second Coming, in the fall. &quot;Love Spreads,&quot; the Stone Roses&#x27; comeback single, was debuted on Radio One in early November. The single received a lukewarm reaction and entered the charts at number two, not the expected number one. Second Coming received mixed reviews and only spent a few weeks in the Top Ten. The Stone Roses planned an international tour in early 1995 to support the album, but the plans kept unraveling at the last minute. Before they could set out on tour, Reni left the band, leaving the group without a drummer. He was replaced by Robbie Maddix, who had previously played in Rebel MC. After Maddix joined the band, they embarked on a short American tour at the conclusion of which John Squire broke his collar bone in a bike accident. Squire&#x27;s accident forced them to cancel a headlining spot at the 25th Glastonbury Festival, which would have been their first concert in the U. K. in five years. As Squire recuperated, the Stone Roses continued to sink in popularity and respect -- even as their peers, the Charlatans and former Happy Mondays vocalist Shaun Ryder, made unexpectedly triumphant comebacks. The Stone Roses added a keyboardist to the lineup prior to their U. K. tour at the end of 1995 -- it was the first British tour since 1990. In the spring of 1996, John Squire announced that he was leaving the band he founded in order to form a new, more active band. The Stone Roses announced their intention to carry on with a new guitarist, but by October of that year the group was finished. Squire&#x27;s new band, The Seahorses, released its debut album in June 1997 gaining commercial sucess, while Brown released his solo debut, Unfinished Monkey Business, early in 1998 to critical acclaim. Ian Brown continues with a solo career no-one thought possible and has signed a new two album deal with Fiction records. He says that by listening to the Floor Monks, he has helped to achieve that once great roar sound again. After the Seahorses disbanded John Squire decided he would go it alone and released two albums with North Country Records. He is currently on a sabbatical and concentrating on his art but promises &quot;one more ferocious guitar album&quot;. Mani is still playing bass for Primal Scream. Reni is currently raising a family. He was recently spotted at a gig with Squire and Mani. When questioned about a Roses reunion, he spoke favourably about it. Although Brown has said that they will get back together when Man City wins the Champions League. On October 18, 2011, the band announced they had reunited and would play two concerts in June 2012. ", "Swans": "Swans is a band from New York, United States, active from 1982 to 1997, reformed in 2010, led by singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Michael Gira. Marginally associated with the no wave scene at first, their original sound was slow and extremely heavy, with live performances that were often so brutal and physical that in a number of instances certain audience members were made ill, police were called and venues were shut down. This early physical sound is possibly best heard on the live album Public Castration Is A Good idea. Their initial style shifted a little by the time Swans released seminal twin albums Greed and Holy Money. The music had sped up, at times being even more punishing than their earlier output. Drum machines and samples were slightly more prominent. Michael Gira was joined vocally by Jarboe which gave the band a broader sonic range. Tracks featuring Jarboe were often quieter, even pretty, acting as counterpoint to the more harrowing themes on the albums. Over time, this style would come to dominate Swans&#x27; output, although they somehow seem to have been able to make a strummed acoustic guitar seem as brutal as their earlier amped-up assaults. The lush instrumentation of their albums from the late 1980s and the 1990&#x27;s anticipated the birth of post-rock. Swans eventually broke up in 1997; Gira went on to release some solo work, later forming the band The Angels Of Light, who continue many of the themes and styles found in (later) Swans. Jarboe releases solo work and frequently works with other bands and artists; recently she released an album with Neurosis, a group clearly heavily influenced by Swans. The influence of Swans upon the music world is profound. Across their 15 years of existence, the various styles they explored gave birth to grindcore (Napalm Death, Nasum) modern &quot;cinematic&quot; post-rock (Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Mono), and atmospheric sludge metal (Isis, Neurosis). In January 2010, Michael Gira reactivated Swans and released a new album, My Father Will Guide Me Up a Rope to the Sky on September 2010, and the band simultaneously embarked on a world tour scheduled to last eighteen months. The band had been chosen by Portishead to perform at the ATP I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror festivals that they curated in July 2011 at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace and in September 2011 in Asbury Park, New Jersey. On August 28, 2012, Swans released The Seer, a double-album running almost 2 hours in length. Frontman Michael Gira described the album as taking &quot;30 years to make. It&#x27;s the culmination of every previous Swans album as well as any other music I&#x27;ve ever made, been involved in or imagined. But it&#x27;s unfinished, like the songs themselves. It&#x27;s one frame in a reel. The frames blur, blend and will eventually fade. &quot; Describing the songwriting process, Gira said, &quot;The songs began on an acoustic guitar, then were fleshed out with (invaluable) help from my friends, then were further tortured and seduced in the studio, and now they await further cannibalism and force-feeding as we prepare to perform some of them live, at which point they&#x27;ll mutate further, endlessly, or perhaps be discarded for a while. &quot;", "Paul McCartney": "Sir James Paul McCartney , MBE (born 18 June 1942), born in Liverpool, UK, is the most successful songwriter in the history of popular music. McCartney is a multiple Grammy Award- and Academy Award-winning English singer-songwriter, poet, composer, multi-instrumentalist, entrepreneur, record producer, film producer, painter, and animal rights and peace activist. He gained worldwide fame as a member of The Beatles, alongside John Lennon, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr. McCartney and Lennon formed one of the most influential and successful songwriting partnerships and wrote some of the most popular songs in the history of rock music. After leaving The Beatles in 1970, McCartney launched a successful solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda Eastman, and singer-songwriter Denny Laine. He has worked on film scores and classical and electronic music, released a large catalogue of songs as a solo artist, and taken part in projects to help international charities. McCartney is listed in Guinness World Records as the most successful musician and composer in popular music history, with 60 gold discs and sales of 100 million singles. His song &quot;Yesterday&quot; (credited to Lennon/McCartney, but composed entirely by McCartney) is listed as the most covered song in history--by over 3,500 artists so far--and has been played more than 7,000,000 times on American television and radio. Wings&#x27; 1977 single &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; became the first single to sell more than two million copies in the UK, and remains the UK&#x27;s top selling non-charity single. According to britishhitsongwriters. com, he is the most successful songwriter in UK singles chart history, based on weeks that his compositions have spent on the chart. Following the death of his first wife Linda in 1998, McCartney married Heather Mills in 2002. They divorced in 2008. McCartney now has Nancy Shevell as his partner. McCartney practices meditation, sometimes still using the mantra that the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi gave him when The Beatles went to a transcendental meditation seminar in 1967. McCartney is an advocate for animal rights, vegetarianism, and music education; he is active in campaigns against landmines, seal hunting, and Third World debt. He is a keen football fan, supporting both Everton and Liverpool football clubs. His company MPL Communications owns the copyrights to more than 3,000 songs, including all of the songs written by Buddy Holly, along with the publishing rights to such musicals as Guys and Dolls , A Chorus Line , and Grease . McCartney is one of Britain&#x27;s wealthiest men, with an estimated fortune of PS750 million ($1. 2 billion) in 2009. ", "The Veils": "The Veils (formed in 2002) are a New Zealand band based in London, fronted by Finn Andrews. Their sound has been compared to artists as diverse as Jeff Buckley, The Birthday Party, The Smiths, and Joy Division. Their live shows have become famed for their emotional intensity and Finn&#x27;s often scarily possessed stage presence. They released their debut album, The Runaway Found , in Spain late in 2003. The first single from the album, Lavinia, was released through Rough Trade on November 24, 2003. They released the album globally in January 2004 with a different track listing. It went gold worldwide the following year. The original lineup of The Veils (which included Oli Drake, Ben Woollacott and Adam Kinsella) disbanded in late 2004, and Andrews returned to New Zealand in order to find a new lineup. He spent the New Zealand summer rehearsing with high school classmates Liam Gerrard (keyboards) and Sophia Burn (bass), and the trio returned to London early 2005. There they got connected to Dan Raishbrook (Guitar) and Henning Dietz (drums). However Liam Gerrard left the band half way into their American tour in 2007. The group recorded their second album Nux Vomica at Underbelly Studios in Los Angeles, with producer Nick Launay, and the album was released September 18, 2006. The album features string arrangements by ex-Lounge Lizard and long time Lou Reed collaborator Jane Scarpontoni. Nux Vomica featured on 9 critics&#x27; Best Of The Year lists in 2006. In the 16 months following the release of Nux Vomica The Veils played over 250 shows across 15 countries and during the U. S. leg of the tour it was announced that keyboardist Liam Gerrard would leave the band to return home to New Zealand due to personal reasons. The Veils carried on as a four piece and, whilst living out of a classic car garage in Oklahoma City, started recording new demos between playing shows on the east and west coasts of the America. By mid-2008 they were back to London to begin work on their third album with producer Graham Sutton. The recording sessions at West Point Studios lasted only three weeks and at the end of the summer the album was done and ready to be mixed. In March 2009 they began touring the new songs in Europe and America with new drummer Raife Burchell (of Jetplane Landing), after Henning Dietz&#x27; defection. Sun Gangs was released on April 6 2009 and was featured in many websites top albums of 2009. The band spent the summer of 2010 working on new material. On December 6 it was announced that a new 7 song EP entitled Troubles of the Brain is set to be released on January 24, and that the band had left Rough Trade after almost 9 years and started their own label, Pitch Beast Records. The EP is produced by Finn Andrews and Bernard Butler and was recorded at Finn&#x27;s home studio in London. In mid 2012 The Veils threatened legal action on UK hardcore band Veils due to the similarity in name. This forced Veils to alter the spelling of their name to Vales. The Veils will be releasing a new record, 'Time Stays, We Go' in April 2013. ", "Filipe Catto": "Filipe is an upcoming singer/songwriter from Porto Alegre, Brazil. He has recently finished his first studio work, a 6-track EP called Saga. Saga, was self-funded and independently released and is available online for free download. ", "Motorhead": "Motorhead are a British heavy metal band formed in London, UK in 1975 by bassist, singer and songwriter Ian Fraser Kilmister, known mostly by his stage name Lemmy, who has remained the sole constant member. The band pre-dated, but are sometimes regarded as part of, the New Wave of British Heavy Metal , which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Motorhead is also regarded as, with Judas Priest and Accept, one of the first Speed Metal bands. Motorhead are typically classified as heavy metal, and their fusion of punk rock into the genre helped to pioneer speed metal and thrash metal. Lemmy dislikes such labels, preferring to describe the band&#x27;s music simply as &quot;rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot; and usually opening live shows with the line &quot;We are Motorhead. We play rock and roll. &quot; Usually a power trio, Motorhead had particular success in the early 1980s with several successful singles in the UK Top 40 chart. The albums Overkill, Bomber, Ace of Spades, and particularly No Sleep &#x27;til Hammersmith, cemented Motorhead&#x27;s reputation as one of Britain&#x27;s foremost rock bands. Motorhead&#x27;s approach has remained the same over the band&#x27;s career, preferring to play what they enjoy and do best; their appreciation of early rock and roll is reflected in some of their occasional cover songs. Motorhead&#x27;s lyrics typically cover such topics as war, good versus evil, abuse of power, promiscuous sex, substance abuse, and &quot;life on the road&quot;. The band&#x27;s distinctive fanged-face logo, War-Pig (AKA Snaggletooth), with its oversized boar&#x27;s horns, chains, and spikes, was created by artist Joe Petagno in 1977 for the cover of the Motorhead album and has appeared in many variations on covers of ensuing albums.

He began his professional career on YouTube, where he was discovered by his future manager, Scooter Braun. Braun flew Bieber to Atlanta, Georgia, to consult with Usher and soon signed a record deal with Island. The first part of his two-part debut album My World was released on November 17, 2009. Four successful pre-album singles have been released: \"One Time\", \"One Less Lonely Girl\", \"Love Me\", and \"Favorite Girl\", which were Top 15 hits on the Canadian Hot 100 and Top 40 hits on the Billboard Hot 100. This accomplishment made Bieber the only solo artist in Billboard history to have four singles from a debut album chart in the Top 40 of the Hot 100 before the album's release. The album received positive reviews from critics, and debuted at #6 on the U. S. Billboard 200, selling 137,000 copies in its first week, which was the second best opening release for a new artist in 2009. It also debuted at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. As of the fifth week, the album has sold over 522,000 copies in the United States, and has been certified Platinum in Canada. Part II of My World is currently set for a March 2010 release. ", "Black Breath": "Black Breath is a death metal/crossover band from the Pacific Northwest who have quickly shredded their way to popularity. With members of Shook Ones, Go It Alone, Blue Monday, Get The Most, and On, they began in 2007 as crossover band with a joking spirit such as songs like &quot;Party Idea&quot; in their 2007 Demo. In 2008, they released a 4-song 12&quot; EP, Razor To Oblivion, which proved their step in a more serious direction, writing riffs that are reminiscent of first-wave thrash, black, and death metal bands such as Celtic Frost and Hellhammer, but maintain a traditional hardcore punk undertone. Although Black Breath is a fairly young band they are quickly becoming everyone&#x27;s new favorite band. They have absolutely stormed onto the hardcore and metal scene with their unique and uncompromising sound. After gathering a loyal cult following the band took their assault around the USA supporting Trap Them and Victims. Late last year Southern Lord released the very first recordings from Black Breath in the form of the Razor to Oblivion EP. Raw, intense and in your face this EP has created a immense buzz and effectively set up the highly anticipated next move! For this, their debut full-length the band went into Kurt Ballou&#x27;s (Converge, Trap Them, Disfear) God City studios in Salem, Massachussets. The end result of those monumental sessions is a recording much darker, heavier and more brutal than anything they have done before. The direction of the album contains many of the punk and hardcore influences that were exhibited on the Razor To Oblivion EP. However, after listening to just five seconds of the albums opening track, &quot;Black Sin (Spit On The Cross)&quot; it&#x27;s painfully obvious the band has let their Swedish death metal obsession take control! One of the bands strengths is its ability to truly craft a memorable song with hooks that dig into your skull and never let up. This is heavily apparent on the thrashing burner &quot;Children of The Horn&quot;. Not since the mid-eighties when bands like Motorhead, Metallica and Discharge were giving metal heads bangovers has brutality been so infectious. The decidedly more Death Metal direction of Heavy Breathing is a extremely bold move that will definitely set them apart from the rest.

They suffered an accident in 2003. In 2006 they released their second album called &quot;Red Album&quot;. ", "Stereophonics": "Stereophonics are a Welsh rock band, formed in 1992 in Cwmaman, Wales, United Kingdom, by friends Kelly Jones (guitar/vocals), Stuart Cable (drums; died 2010) and Richard Jones (bass) but no relation to Kelly. Colloquially known to their fans as the &#x27;Phonics or the Stereos, in the years preceding their popularity, they went through shifting line-ups and were known by a variety of names including &quot;KDR&quot;, &quot;Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Silent Runner&quot;, &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and their most widely known pre-Phonics moniker &quot;Tragic Love Company,&quot; taking one word from each member&#x27;s favourite band (The Tragically Hip, Mother Love Bone, and Bad Company). The band&#x27;s official current line-up is Kelly Jones, Richard Jones, Javier Weyler and Adam Zindani. Tragic Love Company had started out as a 4-piece band playing covers and original songs that had a blues vibe. After various fourth members, including childhood friend Simon Collier, left, the band decided to stick to being a 3-piece, ditching the blues for an edgier, punk sound which would translate better when played live. The band played up and down the country playing shows which ranged from less than 10 people to packing hundreds into small venues the length of the M4. It wasn&#x27;t until John Brand took over as their manager in 1996 that the music industry started to take interest in the band. The name Tragic Love Company was decidely dropped for being too long-winded, and after Stuart saw the lettering on his father&#x27;s radiogram, they adopted the name &#x27;The Stereophonics&#x27;, before quickly dropping the &#x27;The&#x27; to simply Stereophonics. On August 1st, 1996 they became the first band to be signed to Richard Branson&#x27;s new label V2. Kelly, Stuart and Richard grew up in Cwmaman, a former coal mining pit village near Aberdare, South Wales, noted only for having some of the steepest hills in the United Kingdom; a fact eluded to in the BBC Wales documentary &#x27; The Road Up is the Worst &#x27; aired as part of BBC Wales&#x27; St. David&#x27;s day celebrations. Kelly worked locally in a variety of jobs including on a fruit and veg stall where he would observe people as they wandered by or stopped to talk. It was this acute attention to detail that provided the inspiration for all of the early Stereophonics material. Inspired by a modern approach to storytelling a la Paul Weller, the only natural way of songwriting for Kelly, who was and remains the principal lyricist for the band, was to write about what you know. At the time, the young Kelly felt that having as many words in the songs as he had written would mean that they&#x27;d be harder to remember and even harder for fans to regurgitate at gigs, but they pursued with writing material that meant something to them on such a personal level. These songs formed the majority of material submitted to tape for their first studio album and also in a wealth of B-sides that accompanied their subsequent singles. As part of the rising Britpop movement in the late 1990s, and also what would eventually be coined as the &#x27;cool Cymru&#x27; phase of a dominance of welsh bands charting well on a national level. Word Gets Around &#x27;Word Gets Around&#x27; was released on the 25th of August, 1997, with equal credit being given to all three members of the band for writing the songs Jones/Jones/Cable) with credit for the words given to Kelly Jones. It was preceded by singles Local Boy in the Photograph (#51), More Life in a Tramps Vest (#33) and A Thousand Trees (#22) and it charted well at #6 in the UK album charts. Following the success of the album, Traffic (#20) was released in October 1997 and the band capped off an exceptional year by winning the 1998 BRIT award for &#x27;British Breakthrough Act&#x27;. They also re-released Local Boy in the Photograph and it gained a more respectable chart positioning at #14 and played to their biggest crowd in their career to that point by receiving a heroes welcome at their homecoming gig in Cardiff Castle on June 12th, where they played to a 10,000 strong crowd during a 19-song set which included 5 new songs. By this stage, the live setup of the band had grown to include Tony Kirkham as the touring pianist and keyboard player. The song Local Boy In the Photograph has since become a cult classic and was given a Q Classic Song Award at the Q Awards in 2007. A video was also shot for the song Not Up to You but the track remained unreleased by V2. Performance and Cocktails In November 1998, the band moved quickly to start the wheels turning on the release of their second album, &#x27;Performance and Cocktails&#x27;, releasing the song The Bartender and the Thief to wide commercial success. Despite it&#x27;s heavier, archaic sound it charted at #3 - the band&#x27;s highest charting up until that point - which would remain the highest ranked single chart position for 7 years along with other songs they would subsequently release. In February, just prior to the album release, another single Just Looking (#4) was released, again to massive commercial and critial acclaim and on March 8th, 1999 V2 released Performance and Cocktails. The songs were variously recorded at Real World Studios in Bath, Parkgate in Sussex and Rockfield in Monmouth, and the album was a major success, hitting the UK album chart #1 instantly. It&#x27;s success was only heightened by the following successful single Pick a Part That&#x27;s New (#4) with it&#x27;s promotional video which included the band sending up the film &#x27;The Italian Job&#x27;. Buoyed by their first #1 album and recent chart success, the band announced they would be playing their biggest ever show at the soon to be demolished Morfa Stadium, Swansea. On July 31, 1999, the band took to the stage in front of 50,000 adoring people. The show, which was one of the largest ever outdoor gatherings to take place in Wales at the time, and was a triumphant success. Two weeks after playing to their mammouth audience in Swansea, the band took home the Kerrang! award for &#x27;Best British Band&#x27; and &#x27;Best Album&#x27; for &#x27;Performance and Cocktails&#x27;. On the back of the Morfa Stadium show, they released two more singles. I Wouldn&#x27;t Believe Your Radio and Hurry Up and Wait, both songs which were a departure for the normally consistant, rockier sound that had come to be expected, but still charted well, both hitting the #11 spot. The videos for the songs on this album also became more elaborate than that of the singles from &#x27;Word Gets Around&#x27; and leant heavily on the medium of cinema. The inspiration for four of the singles came directly from the films the band liked and they played out their fantasy roles in their individual promos. By subtely tweaking the narrative to suit the look of the band or feel of the song, the videos for The Bartender and the Thief, Pick a Part That&#x27;s New (a track the band performed before the 1999 IRB Rugby World Cup Final at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff), I Wouldn&#x27;t Believe Your Radio and Hurry Up and Wait all took their direct inspiration, or as some would say, parodying out of films such as Apocalypse Now , The Italian Job , Easy Rider and M*A*S*H* respectively with Just Looking, though not a direct tribute to any particular film as such, still had a very filmic quality to it. These videos, along with the videos from &#x27;Word Gets Around&#x27; were released on a compilation DVD in 2000 called &#x27;Call Us What You Want But Don&#x27;t Call Us in the Morning&#x27; . In 2000, Stereophonics featured on the Tom Jones comeback album called &#x27;Reload&#x27;, contributing a duet performance of the Three Dog Night cover, Mama Told Me Not To Come, and Kelly was a guest artist on the Jools Holland Hootenanny New Year&#x27;s Eve show, where Kelly would accompany Jools and his Rhythm and Blues Orchestra in a performance of the Mike d&#x27;Abo penned classic Handbags and Gladrags. This song would eventually go on to become a Stereophonics favourite in it&#x27;s own right. Just Enough Education to Perform Once again teaming up with Bird and Bush to produce their album, the Stereophonics set about recording an album that was a sonic departure for what they had previously amassed as a band. In the years that had taken them away from small town Cwmaman and around the world as the new darlings of the Britpop machine, they had come to experience a lot more of the good and bad sides the music industry had to offer. Preceded by the track Mr. Writer, it was a downbeat, acoustic drawl that saw their comeback on the UK chart scene. It charted well at #5, and had an infectious melancholy hook, but the song was a direct response to a journalist that had toured with the band on an American tour. The band claim that he had &quot; lived amongst them, ate their food and drank their drink &quot; (citation needed) but when he left the band to write about them, the review was very negative. This lead to a steely attitude being taken by the band after this. However, this had a knock on effect to the band in general, as the media regarded Jones with a growing discomfort and unease that neither he, or the band have ever really been able to shake. The second single, the polar opposite of Mr. Writer, was Have a Nice Day (also UK#5), a poppy, joyful song about taking a taxi ride in California. The subjects of Jones&#x27; writings have for a long time been put under the microscope, but consistently, you can get a feel for the experience he was having at the time by taking the lyrics as read. Have a Nice Day itself is a clear dividing point for many Stereophonics fan. The success of this song and the album that followed gained the band a wealth of new fans, but older fans felt that the band were moving too far into a new, pop-orientated direction. The album, the appropriately titled &#x27;Just Enough Education to Perform&#x27; went straight in at #1 in the UK. The band had originally wanted to name the album &#x27;JEEP&#x27;, a shortened word which stood for the phrase that apparently Kelly got from his brother after he came home from a stint in the army and wrote the word on his bedroom wall. However, Daimler-Chrysler copyrighted the word this name so it was changed to its current, elongated title. It is commonly referred to by it&#x27;s acronym, &#x27;J. E. E. P. &#x27;, with the album itself seeing a departure from the normal 3-piece rock sound, and straying more into dreamy acoustic and indie rock territory. The album spawned three further other singles, one of which was the country-tinged Step On My Old Size Nines (UK#4). On July 21st, the Stereophonics followed in the footsteps of the Manic Street Preachers and played a full concert at the newly built Millennium Stadium, Cardiff. Then in November 2001, the band announced it would release Handbags and Gladrags (UK#4) as an official studio track, though it wasn&#x27;t on the current album tracklisting. &#x27;Just Enough Education to Perform&#x27; got a re-release with the song included, and also a hidden bonus track called Surprise, which was originally a b-side on the Have a Nice Day single . The band performed as part of the lineup for the follow up to the Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball for Amnesty International&#x27;s &#x27; We Know Where You Live&#x27; 2001 at Wembley Arena, where they played an acoustic version of Have a Nice Day and also teamed up with Tom Jones to perform Mama Told Me Not To Come. 2002, saw the release of the DVD, &#x27; A Day at the Races &#x27;, which was a live DVD documenting the gig at the Millennium Stadium the previous July, and to raise the profile of the DVD, the fifth and final single from &#x27;J. E. E. P. &#x27; was released. Vegas Two Times, the album opener was released on DVD single, and live footage from &#x27;A Day at the Races&#x27; was overdubbed with the studio track for the video. &#x27;Just Enough Education to Perform&#x27;, and Vegas Two Times (UK#23) as a prime example was also the first time the band moved away from having just one prolific singer or harmoniser. Vegas Two Times opens the album with a minute of female harmonies before the track kicks in. This extended intro was completely cut for the single version, and also when being played live, but by this point in their career, the live 4-piece had once again grown to included second touring guitarist Scott James, and backing singers Aileen McLaughlin and Anna Ross. The album itself divided fans and critics alike. Most opinions were and still are very cold towards the record, citing the dramatic departure from the band&#x27;s signature sound as main reason behind it&#x27;s poor critial reception. It is also worth noting the effect that &#x27;Mr. Writer&#x27; had on the relationship between the media and the increasingly outspoken Jones. Most reviewers refute this claim however, citing a lacklustre performance in songwriting as the principal downfall of the LP. Fans are also split, for some of them were not fans until the release of the album and use of such tracks as Have a Nice Day on TV commercials. Others see the departure in signature sound as a fall from grace the band has yet to recover, whilst the more pragmatic approaches seem to suggest that the giddy days at the time of &#x27;WGA&#x27; and &#x27;Performance&#x27; were dizzy heights that will probably never be reached again, if only for the luck of timing and social chords that were struck within the era of these intial albums. The band themselves were quick to defend the sound of the album, without making any apology for the songs that made the cut, suggesting that the rigours of touring the world as a rock band mean that they were constantly in an environment surrounded by loud music, and when they got back on their tour bus, they wanted to distance themselves from that sound, so they turned to a different type of music. In turn, this music feeds the inspiration for the upcoming songwriting process. You Gotta Go There to Come Back In June 2002, the band headlined the Pyramid stage of the prestigious Glastonbury festival, displaying a confident reportoire of songs new and old alike, and for the first time played unreleased songs, the most significant and electrifiying of these performances being that of future lead single Madame Helga. After a summer of festival appearances the band settled in back at their homes to write songs for the album. In the coming months, both Kelly and Richard both decided it would be better if they moved to London, to ease their label pressures and commitments. Stuart declined to do the same. Instead, Cable was given his own TV chat show, Cable TV , by BBC Wales, where he would host lively chat and music, which included an acoustic set by Stereophonics, although curiously without Stuart, obviously wanting to draw clear definitions between his band and his TV persona. They played acoustic versions of songs that would go on to become Getaway and Climbing the Wall. When it came to the new album, it is widely assumed that Kelly wrote the songs without any input from anyone, except live recording engineer and personal friend Jim Lowe. In the liner notes of the new album, Kelly wrote: &quot; We got together as a band and rehearsed the demos at Stuart&#x27;s garage a week before going into the studio&#8230; &quot; But demanding schedulings had already begun to put a strain on the working relationship of the band. The studio process also changed for this album. Relying heavily on live engineer Lowe to capture the tracks in as few takes as nessessary added to the very live and raw sound on the album. Kelly also took over the role of producer, and outsourced the mixing of the album to experienced, Grammy Award-winning music engineer and producer Jack Joseph Puig ( Weezer, Green Day, The Black Crowes, Goo Goo Dolls ). Preceded by the released of lead single Madame Helga (UK#4), the new album, titled &#x27;You Gotta Go There to Come Back&#x27; again went straight in at the UK#1 spot. The album had more of a bluesy feeling, and with it, a confident swagger of sleazy Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll (showcased on songs such as Jealousy and Help Me (She&#x27;s Out of Her Mind)) juxtaposed with the subtle frailties of lost love and innocence (I Miss You Now, Since I Told You It&#x27;s Over). The song were on a more personal level, rather than on a narrative, and faced issues like alcohol and drug abuse, sex and procarious living more than had reviously been addressed by the band. On July 21st, 2003 the band released their biggest international smash song to date, the gorgeous and aching Maybe Tomorrow which charted in the UK at #3, but went on to transcend the band&#x27;s status as a restricted UK act. The melotron and rhodes piano sound that gave the song its melancholy charm found it&#x27;s way onto quite a few American TV and film soundtracks including &#x27; Wicker Park &#x27; and later on the 2005 Academy Award-winning film &#x27; Crash &#x27;. The band lined up on last single to be released in the UK prior to finishing their world tour in 2003, the aforementioned Since I Told You It&#x27;s Over was scheduled for released in November. However, in September whilst in America touring the album, Stuart Cable was sacked by the two founding members of the band, Kelly and Richard, citing commitment issues as the sole reason for the departure. Reported by the BBC in September 2003, Kelly said on the band&#x27;s website: &quot; Me and Stuart started a band when I was 12. Emotionally to me this is heartbreaking, I love him like a brother, but commitment-wise there have been issues since Just Enough Education To Perform. &quot; Cable had pulled out of imminent and ongoing US tour dates citing ill health and had suspended his own touring regime at the advise of doctors, though the band were set to continue toruing without him, leaving him to return to the UK to recuperate. Cable has always claimed that he knew nothing of his sacking until being confronted with it by the media. The band replaced him on the road with friend and former drummer for The Black Crowes, Steve Gorman. Gorman remained on tour with the band until they had completed every date, and even appeared in the video for bonus single Moviestar, a track that didn&#x27;t make the original cut of the album, but was to be released as a single in it&#x27;s own right. Stuart Cable provided the drums tracks for the song in studio before his departure, but had already been sacked before the video had been shot. Similarly, Cable had completed the shoot for the previous single Since I Told You It&#x27;s Over just before his abrupt exit. On the 20th December, Cardiff&#x27;s Millennium Stadium would once again play host as the final gig of the world tour, and end a successful year on the road in which they had played in excess of over 60 gigs and festivals in no less than 14 different countries. They ended a turbulent year on a high. Language. Sex. Violence. Other? Work began on the follow up record in January 2004, almost as soon as the &#x27;YGGTTCB&#x27; tour was completed. A settlement was reached between the remaining members of the band and Cable as compensation for his axing, but the bitterness between the band, both current and former, was apparant, with Cable brandishing Jones a &#x27;dictator&#x27;. The recording process for new record was to take up the entirety of 2004. Writing for the album had taken place on the road between 2003-2004, and the band quickly put the disappointments of the previous year behind them and focused on recapturing the imaginations of their listeners. After writing the bulk of the songs for the new record, which was set to throw back to the days of old, the band went into the studio to record the album demos. In April 2004, Kelly and Richard were assisted in the studio by Javier Weyler, an audio engineer, and former member of Vitriol I. D. , who had worked with the band on &#x27;You Gotta Go There to Come Back&#x27; and provided percussion on a number of songs that made the eventual cut of the finished album. The band felt at this point that this process required a committed drummer. Steve Gorman was not considered as a full time replacement for Stuart Cable and Gorman later rejoined the reformed Black Crowes in 2005. As Weyler had assisted in recording demos for Stereophonics&#x27; new studio album, later on that year Kelly Jones and Richard Jones wrote to Javier inviting him to drum permanently within the band. Javier accepted the offer and met up with the rest of the band to finish Stereophonics&#x27; fifth studio album &#x27;Language. Sex. Violence. Other?&#x27;. Apart from Weyler, there were no other additions to the Stereophonics line up, but the band decided that the big band sound which had seen their live stage set up rise to a 7-piece band was now a thing of the past. Aileen McLaughlin, Anna Ross and Scott James ceased to be part of both long or short terms plans the band had. Tony Kirkham remains the a part of the live set up, but Kelly Jones played piano parts on the new album, rather than Kirkham. After a decade of recording studio albums (the last 3 all #1&#x27;s) the band scored its first UK#1 single with their seminal track Dakota, the first single of the new album. Released on February 28th 2005, the midweek charts had put the track in the favourable situation of being the top selling track at the midway point of the week. The track&#x27;s popularity continued throughtout the week, and was eventually crowned the UK&#x27;s #1 single on BBC Radio 1 the following Sunday. The track itself heralded a new era for the band, drawing on elements of the rock history that had brought the band to the heights it had achieved, but also pulsed with a new, modern enthusiasm, and also contained an electronic vibe, thanks to it&#x27;s intro and outro samples. This single, for a band that had always been more concerned with album sales, rather than single sales, meant a new found sense of acceptance and justification. Two weeks later, on March 14th, &#x27;Language. Sex. Violence. Other?&#x27; was released and also went to #1 in the UK charts. The band&#x27;s fourth consecutive #1 album, and a new sound to confound the critics that had so easily written them off. The album received critical acclaim in the British music press, including most notably the NME, who had been one of the band&#x27;s harshest critics in the past, who called the album &quot; &#8230;angry, edgy, dense and intelligent&#8230; an excellent modern rock record&#8230; &quot; The album was a journey through the rock Americana sounds similar in concept to that of bands like U2, it had a harder, edgier and angrier than we&#x27;d seen from the band in a long time. Riding high on the success of their first chart-topping single and another chart-topping album, Stereophonics became the first band to play at Apple&#x27;s Regent Street store in London, showcasing 5 tracks from the new album and releasing the first in what eventually became a long line of exclusive EPs put out by Apple iTunes titled &#x27;Live in London&#x27;. The album also delivered a further three singles, album opener Superman, Devil, the controversial video for which was banned from television circulation due to it&#x27;s content, and Rewind. All the tracks on the album had one word titles, and videos for all the singles, including the banned &#x27;Devil&#x27; were dirtected by Charles Mehling. The music video for this song shows Kelly Jones in an apartment, tied to a chair. A woman arrives and appears to be the kidnapper. Soon after, he is taken outside and forced into the trunk of a car that she drives to an unknown place. There are shots of the band performing this song occasionally. At the end of the video, the title card &quot;To Be Continued&#8230;&quot; appears. The video for &#x27;Rewind&#x27; subsequently deals with the content in the video for &#x27;Devil&#x27; and the other videos for the singles taken from this album, by piecing together a common narrative through the four promos. The &#x27;Rewind&#x27; video picks up where the video for &#x27;Devil&#x27; left off, with singer Kelly being let out of the trunk of his kidnappers&#x27; car. It is revealed to be a set, and the car is simply driving along in front of a moving screen. Kelly then walks on a treadmill in a studio made up of sets from the previous videos of &#x27;Dakota&#x27;, &#x27;Superman&#x27; and &#x27;Devil&#x27;. On Saturday, 2nd July 2005, the world&#x27;s focus turned to various events around the world as LIVE8 took place. 20 years after the groundbreaking Live Aid events captured the imagination of the developed world, an estimated 3 billion people watched LIVE 8, called the greatest show on Earth, as artists around the world came together with one message - make poverty history. Stereophonics played a 4 song set at the Hyde Park venue in front of 200,000 people. Around the same time, &#x27;Dakota&#x27; became the first Stereophonics single to achieve success on alternative rock radio stations in the United States - where it was promoted as &quot;Dakota (You Made Me Feel Like The One)&quot;. Before &quot;Dakota&quot;, no Stereophonics single had charted on any rock charts in the U. S, including the worldwide hit &#x27;Maybe Tomorrow. After its release in February, the single steadily gained ground on U. S. alternative rock radio, notably on stations such as WFNX, WBCN and KROQ. &#x27;Dakota&#x27; continued to gain support across the U. S. and eventually become the first Stereophonics song to chart on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. It first charted on July 9, 2005, almost half a year after its original release. The song peaked at #34 on the chart and remained on the chart for six weeks. It was their first and so-far only single to make the chart. The band once again took off on an extended UK, European and World tour, which ended in 2006. After which, the DVD entitled &#x27; Language. Sex. Violence. Other? &#x27; was released including tour footage, live shots and the videos for the singles from the album of the same name. Live From Dakota In terms of commercial success, the Stereophonics had never had it so good. But weary of the success that had gone before them, they had become a resiliant unit, determined and hardworking to maintain the success they had once again earned, and also displayed a certain amount of level-headedness, keeping their feet firmly on the ground as a forward thinking rock band. In April 2006, they released their first live album, called &#x27;Live From Dakota&#x27;, which despite it&#x27;s name was recorded in and around the UK on the &#x27;L. S. V. O. &#x27; tour. It included 20 tracks across a double CD, and included the previously unreleased track Jayne (live). The album contained no overdubs, and was inteded to show the real side of the band live, mistakes and all. Though, rather than being a recording of single show, every night of the tour was recorded and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. It charted well for a live album, reaching the #13 spot in the UK album chart. For the American release it was released on the band&#x27;s own imprint label, Vox Populi Records. Pull the Pin &#x27;Pull the Pin&#x27; became the sixth studio album by Stereophonics, which was released in the UK on 15 October 2007. A Stereophonics newsletter released the &quot;Pull the Pin&quot; album artwork to suscribers. The cover was also shown to MySpace users that had added the band in a bulletin. In 2006, there was speculation that the next Stereophonics album was originally going to be called &#x27; Cries on Hope Street &#x27;. In 2006, Kelly had taken part in &#x27; The Cool Cymru Collection &#x27; by Terry Morris, which was a collection of photographs designed to make up the first ever Welsh hall of fame. Kelly had his photo taken on the fictional &#x27; Cries on Hope St &#x27;, an anagram of the word &#x27; Stereophonics &#x27; and when asked about the shot, Kelly quipped that they were going to use the photo as the image for the next album, fueling rumours of the new album title. In early 2007, Kelly Jones brought out his first solo album, &#x27;Only The Names Have Been Changed&#x27;, as a limited edition release, which managed to reach number 1 on the iTunes download chart, but was made ineligable by Jones to chart so as not to detract attention from the band onto him solely. He explained that; &quot; We were recording the sixth Stereophonics album last year and in-between takes I started doing these songs off the cuff. Three or four tracks in I realised that this could actually be something. . . strange how it&#x27;s always little things that makes big things happen. &quot; This created speculation that Jones would leave Stereophonics to pursue his solo career, however he denied these rumours and the band pushed on with work on the new album. Due to the success and warm reception of the album however, Jones did a small solo tour around the UK playing songs from the album, before returning swiftly to the band, and refocusing on the new album. During the time Kelly was out on his solo tour, Javier, who had recorded a solo album in his native latin, &#x27;Lagrima&#x27; (meaning &#x27;Tear&#x27;), under the persona of Capitan Melao, which was released on April 2, 2007. The project includes contributions from Phil Manzanera of Roxy Music and Natalia Lafourcade, with Weyler describing it as having &quot; dreamy and poetic &quot; lyrics and Latin rhythms. Weyler&#x27;s alter-ego translates as &#x27;Capitan&#x27; being the Spanish for &#x27;Captain&#x27; and &#x27;Melao&#x27; Latin American slang for &#x27;swing&#x27;, &#x27;rhythm&#x27; or &#x27;soul&#x27;. After the band had reunited, work began on promotion of the sixth studio album. Also during the period between solo albums and the release of the new studio album, the DVD &#x27;Rewind&#x27; was released. It was a 2-disc celebration of an entire decade of Stereophonics material. It contains over three hours of live and documentary footage spanning their entire career; from pre-Stereophonics years to their signing to V2 Records in 1996, up until 2006. A booklet was also included with the DVD, featuring several previously unseen photographs of the band, from Kelly Jones&#x27; own personal photo album. The band also reportedly patched up their relationship with estranged drummer, Stuart Cable, although events from the supposed meetings between the childhood friends, Kelly and Stuart did not match up, and the relationship is still reported to be frosty even today. Cable released his autobiography of his time during the Stereophonics in 2009, entitled &#x27; Demons and Cocktails &#x27;, and is a &#x27;tell all&#x27; book which undoubtably did nothing to ease the strain on his friendship with Kelly. The taster track Bank Holiday Monday had its world premier on Radio 1&#x27;s Chris Moyles Show on Tuesday 1 May 2007 and was made available for digital download on Monday 28 May 2007 from online retailers. The band wanted to released the track as the first proper single off the album, but record company executives declined this, stressing that a different song was more likely to do well in the chart climate they were set to release in. The band&#x27;s newsletter on 24 July 2007 confirmed details and artwork of the first &#x27;proper&#x27; single to be released from the album. It Means Nothing (UK#12) was released in the UK on 24 September 2007. They previews the track at Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend in Preston, which they headlined. It has also appeared on the soundtrack to US drama, &#x27; Bones &#x27;. A second proper single was also released in December 2007. The track My Friends was given an official release but charted at UK#32, making it the lowest charting single by the band since &quot;More Life in a Tramps Vest&quot; reached #33 back in 1997. Decade In The Sun For the &#x27;Pull the Pin&#x27; tour, the guitarist and singer Adam Zindani of SpiderSimpson, who later with Zindani reverted back to their old name of Casino joined the band as a touring guitarist, to give the band a fuller sound and to help the band recreate the music that had been displayed on &#x27;Pull the Pin&#x27;. In a Q&amp;A session on the band&#x27;s website in 2008, Zindani confirmed that whilst still a full time committed member of Casino, he had officially become a proper member of Stereophonics. This story was corroborated by the band, and Zindani&#x27;s own skills as a songwriter were to be utilised by the band on forthcoming songs. In 2008, with the appointment of Zindani in toe, the band surprised fans by announcing the release of a greatest hits album to be called &#x27;Decade in the Sun&#x27;. In addition to the 18 tracks considered hits for the band, the album also included two new songs, You&#x27;re My Star and My Own Worst Enemy which was penned by Jones and Zindani. You&#x27;re My Star was released in a limited number of 7&quot; vinyl, but did sell every copy, meaning that the track charted officially in the UK at #170. To mark the release of the single and also the release of the compilation album, the band held a competition for fans to win tickets to a full-circle gig at the Camden Roundhouse, the venue that the band frequently played gigs &quot;with no f*cker watching us. . &quot; quipped Kelly, before they were a signed act a full decade previously. They had originally wanted to do the gig in Cardiff Castle, but the castle heritage committee decided against the idea, explaining that the fragile state of the castle was no longer able to stand up to the vigorous demands that a rock concert would put upon it. The special edition of &#x27;Decade in the Sun&#x27; contained another 20 songs from the extended collection of the Stereophonics&#x27; back catelogue, and even included some demo tracks and b-sides, which were previously unreleased. A DVD edition of &#x27;Decade in the Sun&#x27; was also released. The band toured the album and the standard version of the CD charted extremely well, peaking at #2 in the UK charts, a great position for a greatest hits album. Up to and including the point of the release of &#x27;Decade&#x27;, the band had released 6 studio albums, 1 live album, 1 compilation album and had amassed 27 hit singles, including 10 UK top-10 songs, with one UK#1. Kelly appeared as a guest on Jools Holland&#x27;s Hootenanny 2008, once again performing Handbags and Gladrags and a cover of &#x27;My Girl&#x27; across the New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration show. They also headlined the V Festival and Isle of Wight Festivals during that summer. Keep Calm and Carry On Aside from finishing the tour triumphantly, selling out venues over the country, 2009 remained a quiet year for the band until August, when via e-mailing list newsletter, the band announced the release date for a new album that was to be called &#x27;Keep Calm and Carry On&#x27;, their first album as an official 4-piece. In addition to the album, they also announced that they would be playing a special, one-off home-coming show in Cardiff Castle on October 3rd, 2009.

", "James": "There are several artists in this entry: 1) a British indie rock band formed in 1981 in Manchester 2) the vocalist of popular Bangladeshi band Nagar Baul 3) a Dutch rapper connected to the Fakkelteitgroep. 1) James (formed 1981 in Manchester, England) are a popular band that were at the forefront of the indie rock movement, releasing a string of hit singles and maintaining popularity through the &#x27;90s. The band&#x27;s sound is mostly defined by their lead singer Tim Booth&#x27;s resonating vocals and emotional lyrics, as well as a spirit of experimentation that they held onto throughout their active career. The band&#x27;s most well-known songs include the hits &quot;Sit Down&quot; and &quot;Laid&quot;, the former marking the band&#x27;s rise to popularity. Although James predate the &#x27;Madchester scene&#x27; of the late 1980s and their sound was never &quot;baggy&quot; nevertheless their Mancunian origins and their more commercial releases were appropriated by the scene. For many reasons, including the departure of lead singer Booth, the band&#x27;s final album became a struggle to record. This departure occurred in 2001 and the band has been inactive since, though they never officially declared a breakup. In 2007, the band was reactivated when Booth returned to the band. 2) James is the vocalist of popular Bangladeshi band Nagar Baul. He was a member of the band Feelings and later formed the band Nagar Baul. James was raised in Chittagong and later moved to Dhaka for his singing career. Stylishly longhaired James&ndash;overwhelmingly known as the Nagar Baul (the City Bard), was the pioneer of psychedelic rock in Bangladesh. Originally a lead singer and guitarist, he has always been respected for his solo projects. He became affectionately called Guru by his fans. His tunes were bright and his singing a divergence from the archetypal tunes preferred by the commercial-type directors. His songs expressed love, rage, discontent, frustration, and happiness. 3) A Dutch rapper connected to the Fakkelteitgroep. ", "RuPaul": "RuPaul (born RuPaul Andre Charles on 17 November 1960) is an American drag performer singer-songwriter, actor and television personality who gained world-wide fame in the 1990s; appearing in a wide variety of television programs, films, and musical albums. Though a catty attitude is often associated with drag queens, RuPaul intentionally set himself apart with a &quot;love one another&quot; attitude. Although primarily known for his extravagant drag queen persona, his has performed as a man in a number of roles, usually billed as RuPaul Charles. Ru was born in born in San Diego, California. His name was given to him by his mother, a Louisiana native. The &quot;Ru&quot; came from roux, which is the term for the base of gumbo and other creole stews and soups. RuPaul struggled as a musician and filmmaker in Atlanta, Georgia during the 1980s. He participated in underground cinema, helping create the low-budget film Star Booty, and an album by the same name. In Atlanta, RuPaul often performed at the Celebrity Club (managed by Larry Tee) as a bar dancer or with his band, Wee Wee Pole. RuPaul also performed as a backup singer to Glen Meadmore along with drag queen Vaginal Davis. RuPaul&#x27;s first prominent national exposure came in 1989 with an extra role dancing in the video for &quot;Love Shack&quot; by The B-52&#x27;s. In the early 1990s, RuPaul worked the Georgia club scene and was known by his full birth name. Initially participating in genderfuck-style performances, RuPaul performed solo and in collaboration with other bands at several New York nightclubs, most notably the Pyramid Club. He played opposite New York City drag performer, Mona Foote (Nashom Benjamin) in the one act Sci-Fi parody &quot;My Pet Homo&quot; written and directed by Jon Michael Johnson for Cooper Square Productions. He appeared for many years at the annual Wigstock drag festival and appeared in the documentary Wigstock: The Movie. In the 1990s, RuPaul was known in the UK for his appearances on the Channel 4 series Manhattan Cable, a weekly series produced by World of Wonder and presented by American Laurie Pike about New York&#x27;s wild and wacky public-access television system. In 1993 RuPaul recorded dance/house albums which included Supermodel of the World. They were released through the rap label Tommy Boy, spawning the dance track hit &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;. The music video was an unexpected success on MTV channels, as grunge and gangsta rap were popular at the time. The song peaked at #45 on the Billboard Hot 100. It further charted on the UK Singles Chart, peaking on the top 40 at #39. The song found the most success peaking at number 2 on the U. S. dance music charts (known as the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart). Airplay, heavy rotation of the music video on the MTV network and television appearances on popular programs like The Arsenio Hall Show popularized the song. His next two singles/videos, &quot;Back to My Roots&quot; and &quot;A Shade Shady (Now Prance)&quot; both went #1 on the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart and furthered his campy persona. Between them, &quot;House of Love&quot; was released without a video. It failed to place on any U. S. charts, despite rising to #68 on the UK Singles Chart. RuPaul caused a controversy at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards when he presented an award with actor Milton Berle, who performed a different type of drag early in his career. The two had conflicts back-stage, and when Berle touched RuPaul&#x27;s false breasts, RuPaul ad-libbed the line &quot;So you used to wear gowns, but now you&#x27;re wearing diapers&quot;. A surprised Berle replied, &quot;Oh, we&#x27;re going to ad lib? I&#x27;ll check my brain and we&#x27;ll start even&quot;. The press portrayed the exchange as a crack in the &quot;love everyone&quot; message RuPaul presented, and as a young newcomer treating a legend poorly. RuPaul would later describe the situation in his autobiography, describing Berle&#x27;s behavior backstage as sexually inappropriate and rude. He did regret the situation, saying: &quot;Of course, what I should have done backstage is told him &#x27;Get your dirty hands off of me, you motherfucker!&#x27;, and then gone out there and been Miss Black America&quot;. That same year would also mark his biggest hit on the UK Singles Chart, a remake of &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot; with Elton John, which went to number seven. It was around this time that RuPaul co-hosted the BRIT Awards in London, also with Elton John. RuPaul was signed to a modeling contract for MAC Cosmetics, making him the first drag queen supermodel. Various billboards featured him in full drag, often with the text &quot;I am the MAC girl&quot;. He also released his autobiography, Lettin&#x27; It All Hang Out. He promoted that book in part with a 1995 guest appearance on ABC&#x27;s All My Children, in a storyline that put it on the set of Erica Kane&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;. The next year he landed a talk show of his own on VH1, called The RuPaul Show, interviewing celebrity guests and musical acts. Diana Ross, Nirvana, Duran Duran, Pat Benatar, Mary J. Blige, Bea Arthur, Dionne Warwick, Cyndi Lauper, Olivia Newton-John, Beenie Man, Pete Burns, Bow Wow Wow, and the Backstreet Boys were notable guests. His co-host was Michelle Visage, with whom he also co-hosted on WKTU radio. On one episode, RuPaul featured guests Chi Chi LaRue and Tom Chase speaking about the gay porn industry. Later in the year he released his second album, Foxy Lady, this time on the L. A. -based Rhino Records label. Despite his growing celebrity, he failed to chart within the Billboard 200. However, the first single &quot;Snapshot&quot; found success in the dance market and went to number four on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. It also enjoyed limited mainstream success, charting at number 95 on the Billboard Hot 100 (which was his second and only other Hot 100 entry to date). The second single &quot;Little Bit of Love&quot; only charted at number 28 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album featured covers of a 1981 Diana Ross song &quot;Work That Body&quot;, co-written by Paul Jabara and &quot;If You Were a Woman and I Was a Man&quot;, originally recorded by Bonnie Tyler. Because of his strong fan base within the gay community, RuPaul has performed at gay pride events and numerous gay clubs. During this time RuPaul helped launch the return of WKTU radio in New York City and would serve as host (with Michelle Visage) of the morning show until 1998. In 1997 he released his third album, a Christmas album entitled Ho, Ho, Ho. He has had guest appearances in many films, including both Brady Bunch movies, in which he played Jan&#x27;s female guidance counselor. In 1997 RuPaul teamed with Martha Wash to remake the classic disco anthem, &quot;It&#x27;s Raining Men&quot;. The song was included on the 1998 compilation CD RuPaul&#x27;s Go Go Box Classics, which was a collection of some of his favorite dance songs by other artists; this would be his third and final release through Rhino Records and a major record label. It was during this time that he appeared in Webex TV commercials and magazine ads. In 2002 he recorded with Brigitte Nielsen, credited as Gitta, the Eurodance track &quot;You&#x27;re No Lady&quot;. In 2004, RuPaul released his fourth album, Red Hot on his own RuCo Inc. Music label. It received some dance radio and club play, but very little press coverage. On his blog, RuPaul discussed how he felt betrayed by the entertainment industry, particularly the gay press. In one incident, it was noted that the magazine Entertainment Weekly refused to review the album, instead asking him to make a comedic contribution to a fashion article. He likened the experience to &quot;a black person being invited to a party, but only if they&#x27;ll serve. &quot; Despite his apparent dissatisfaction with the release, Red Hot showed RuPaul returning to the top of the dance charts in the US with the lead off single &quot;Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous&quot; hitting number two on the dance chart. The second, &quot;WorkOut&quot;, peaked at number five. The third and final single from the album &quot;People Are People&quot; a duet with Tom Trujillo peaked at number 10. The album itself only charted on the Top Electronic Albums chart, where it hit number nine. When asked about this in an interview, RuPaul said, &quot;Well, betrayed might be the wrong word. &#x27;Betrayed&#x27; alludes to an idea that there was some kind of a promise made to me, and there never was. More so, I was disappointed. I don&#x27;t feel like it was a betrayal. Nobody promises anything in show business and you understand that from day one. But, I don&#x27;t know what happened. It seemed I couldn&#x27;t get press on my album unless I was willing to play into the role that the mainstream press has assigned to gay people, which is as servants of straight ideals. &quot; On June 13, 2006, RuPaul released ReWorked, his first remix album and fifth album overall. It features reworked versions of songs from his back catalog, as well as new recordings. The only single released from the album is a re-recording of &quot;Supermodel (You Better Work)&quot;, reaching number 21 on the U. S. dance chart.

In 2009, Drake released his highly anticipated third mixtape so far gone to critical acclaim and commercial success. Its lead single, Best I Ever Had, peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and has since been certified double platinum by the RIAA.

The rapper eventually signed a deal with Young Money Entertainment in the summer of 2009 and released an official EP version of the mixtape soon after; eventually receiving Gold status for shipments of 500,000 units. This astronomical rise to success continued into 2010 with the release of his major label debut album thank me later.

Now, I&#x27;m 26, I&#x27;m with my friends, I&#x27;m making jobs for people, I&#x27;m making memories for people that will last a lifetime. I don&#x27;t need to be in love right now. I don&#x27;t need these things that I maybe once thought that I needed to feel normal and feel righteous about myself. I think for the first time in an album I&#x27;m content--not satisfied--but proud of where I&#x27;m at as a person. &quot; Drake announced in July 2014 that his next album would be titled &#x27;Views from the 6&#x27;, though no release date has been given.

Jamie went on to produce a series of remixes of songs by Gil Scott-Heron from his 2010 album I&#x27;m New Here. The first remix single &#x27;NY Is Killing Me&#x27;, credited to Gil Scott-Heron and Jamie xx, aired on radio stations across the UK and Europe in late 2010, followed by &#x27;I&#x27;ll Take Care Of U&#x27; in January 2011. Both singles drew a lot of attention by the public and critics and set the way for a 13-track remix album entitled &#x27;We&#x27;re New Here&#x27;, out February 21, 2011 on the XL Recordings label and produced entirely by Jamie xx. &#x27;We&#x27;re New Here&#x27; received very positive critical acclaim and was named &quot;a masterpiece in its own right&quot; by BBC&#x27;s Ele Beattie. On June 6th, he released the single &#x27;Far Nearer / Beat For&#x27;, which was met with strong critical acclaim. ", "The Rolling Stones": "The Rolling Stones are an English rock group that formed in London in 1962. First popular in Europe, they quickly became successful in North America during the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of the mid-60s. Since then, their worldwide sales are estimated at more than 200 million albums. In 1989, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 2004, they ranked number 4 in Rolling Stone magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. In 2008, Billboard magazine ranked the Rolling Stones at number ten on &quot;The Billboard Hot 100 Top All-Time Artists&quot;, and as the second most successful group in the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The group was formed by Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Ian Stewart, who met as schoolmates in Dartford, Kent. They took their name from a Muddy Waters song called &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone Blues&quot;, and made their live debut at London&#x27;s Marquee Club (minus Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts). They start playing pubs and clubs around the city and suburbs. Bill Wyman joined later that year (the popular story is that he was asked because he had his own amplifier). In January 1963, Charlie Watts joined the Stones. The band gigged constantly, with residencies at venues like Ealing Jazz Club, Ken Colyer&#x27;s Studio 51, and Eel Pie Island in Twickenham. Their weekly performances at the Crawdaddy at Richmond&#x27;s Station Hotel resulted in ecstatic press reviews, and in April Andrew Loog Oldham saw them there and signed them to his management company the next day. He started the &quot;Would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone&quot; press campaign, which set the tone for their career. In May 1963, the Stones were signed to Decca Records by the same man who had turned down the Beatles. A month later &quot;Come On&quot;, the first Rolling Stones single, was released, and reached number two in the U. K. charts. The fifth member of the group, Brian Jones, left on 8th June 1969, saying that he wanted to form a new group. He was replaced by Mick Taylor, formerly in John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers. In 1971 the Stones, whose contract with Decca had expired, launched their Rolling Stones Records label. In December 1974 Taylor left the group in order to pursue a solo career. He was replaced in 1975 by Ronnie Wood. Since Wyman left the Stones in 1993, the band has consisted of Jagger, Richards, Watts and guitarist Ronnie Wood. In studio and live performances, Darryl Jones (bassist) and Chuck Leavell (keyboardist) also serve as a regular contributors. All the members have also undertaken solo projects of various kinds. ", "Fresno": "A Brazilian Rock outfit hailing from Porto Alegre, Fresno were formed by school friends Leandro &quot;Nego&quot; Pereira (vocals) Lucas &quot;Paraiba&quot; Silveira (guitars), Gustavo &quot;Vavo&quot; Mantovani (guitars), and Pedro &quot;Cuper&quot; Cupertino (drums) in 1999. Bassist Bruno &quot;Lezo&quot; Teixeira joined soon after, and the five-piece was up and running. Their first demo EP, 2001&#x27;s O Acaso do Erro, marked the beginning of their recording career, but turned out to be the end of the road for Pereira, who called it a day, with Silveira taking over on vocals. The band released its first album, Quarto dos Livros, in 2003, which was quickly followed by 2004&#x27;s O Rio a Cidade a Arvore. Following the release of their third album, Ciano, bassist Bruno &quot;Lezo&quot; Teixeira left the group, and the band recruited Abril bassist Rodrigo Tavares to fill the empty roster slot. Fresno released the live album MTV Ao Vivio and won Best New Artist at the MTV Brazil Awards in 2007. The following year Fresno unleashed album number four, Redencao, which also turned out to be the last Fresno album to feature the talents of drummer Pedro Cupertino. He was soon replaced by Rodrigo &quot;Bell&quot; Ruschell. ", "Monkey Majik": "MONKEY MAJIK is a band formed in Sendai, Japan in 2000. The band consists of two canadians brothers, Maynard and Blaise Plant, and two Japanese members, drummer Takuya &quot;Tax&quot; Kikuchi and bass player Hideki &quot;DICK&quot;. MONKEY MAJIK&#x27;s music is energetic pop-rock with lyrics in both English and Japanese. One of the Plant brothers, Maynard (blanc. ), came to Japan in 1997 as an English teacher and speaks fluent Japanese. He then later invited his brother, Blaise Plant, to Japan to form a band due to the interest of music that they shared. They have 7 original albums, 3 Mini-albums, 16 singles and 3 compilation albums. The band&#x27;s first big hit was the single Around The World, the theme song of the TV drama Saiyuuki-Journey to the West. In 2007 they worked on a number of collaborations with other J-pop artists, including hip-hop duo m-flo (&quot;Picture Perfect&quot;), SEAMO (&quot;Zu Ye , soshiteWei Lai he. &quot;) and the Ji Tian Xiong Di  (&quot;Change&quot;). The album Kong hamarude (Sora wa Maru de), was released July 25, 2007. Kong hamarude is MONKEY MAJIK&#x27;s fourth original full-length album. The first press of the album includes two bonus tracks from the MONKEY MAJIK x MONKEY MAGIC single. The song Kong hamarude was used as the Yokohama Type image song and became the first song in Japanese History to reach #1 on USEN Request Chart before being released. On September 2008, they released another album, TIME and the album opened its first week at #2 on the Oricon Chart. They also made a collaboration with Tu Wu anna for the song GINGER that was featured in her album, NUDY SHOW! and was used for the Asahi Ginger Draft commercial song. In 2009 they released two singles: aishiteru and Hong Se noYu  / Open Happiness / MONSTER. Early 2010 they released the single SAKURA and a new compilation titled MONKEY MAJIK BEST ~10Years &amp; Forever~ containing songs from thank you to the newest single. The compilation also contains a song titled Fast Forward which was used as the opening theme for the anime Nurarihyon no Mago. Later 2010, they announced the 6th album and a brand new single. The new single titled nurarihiyonnoSun  opuningutema EP contains the tracks Sunshine and Fast Forward, both used as opening themes for Nurarihyon no Mago and the single was released November 24, 2010. The album, titled westview was released in February 2, 2011. They released a compilation album titled RARE TRACKS in March 2, 2011, containing b-sides from singles and random songs used to movies and animes. The band took a break after the Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami, and in October 26 they released their 15th single: Headlight, followed by the 16th single in early 2012, HERO. In March 7 the band released their 7th original album: Somewhere Out There. ", "Bruce Springsteen": "Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949 in Freehold, New Jersey, United States) is an American songwriter, singer, and guitarist. With a recording career stretching back to 1966 that continues to this day, he&#x27;s recorded multiple award-winning studio albums and toured constantly, inspiring generations of pop and rock musicians. He&#x27;s often known as &quot;The Boss&quot;. He has frequently played as Bruce Springsteen &amp; The E Street Band. Most widely known for his brand of heartland rock infused with pop hooks, poetic lyrics, and Americana sentiments, he often sings songs centered around his native New Jersey. Initially inspired by the tuneful songwriting of British invasion music as well as the vocal swagger of Elvis Presley, his eloquence in expressing ordinary, everyday problems has earned him numerous awards, including twenty Grammy Awards and an Academy Award, along with a notoriously dedicated and devoted global fan base. He has sold over 70 million releases in the U. S. alone. Springsteen&#x27;s lyrics often concern men and women struggling to make ends meet. In this sense he was sometimes compared to Woody Guthrie and other popular folk artists. He has gradually become more and more identified with progressive politics, particularly working-class pride. Springsteen is also noted for his support of various relief and rebuilding efforts in New Jersey and elsewhere, and for his response to the September 11, 2001 attacks, on which his album The Rising reflects. Springsteen&#x27;s recordings have tended to alternate between commercially accessible rock and roll albums, often inspired by contemporary pop rock, and somber folk-oriented works. Much of his iconic status stems from the concerts and marathon shows in which he and the E Street Band present intense ballads, rousing anthems, and party rock and roll songs, among which Springsteen intersperses long, whimsical tales or deeply emotional stories alongside numerous jokes and asides. Springsteen has long had the nickname &quot;The Boss,&quot; a term which he was initially reported to dislike but now seems to have come to terms with, as he sometimes jokingly refers to himself as such on stage. The nickname originated when a young Springsteen, playing club gigs with a band in the 1960s, took on the task of collecting the band&#x27;s nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates. Early years Springsteen was born in a hospital in Long Branch, New Jersey. He was raised in nearby Freehold. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was a bus driver of Dutch and Irish ancestry. His mother, Adele Ann Zirilli, was a legal secretary of Italian ancestry. He has an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister, Pamela. Pamela Springsteen had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full time. Raised a Roman Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima parochial school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with both the nuns and other students, even though much of his later music reflected a deep Catholic ethos and included many rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns. In ninth grade he transferred to the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. He completed high school but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped his own graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out. It is rumored that the Dean of Students confronted Springsteen because his clothing made the other students &quot;uncomfortable. &quot; Springsteen had been inspired to take up music at the age of seven after seeing Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. At 13, he bought his first guitar for $18; later, his mother took out a loan to buy the 16-year-old Springsteen a $60 Kent guitar, an event he later memorialized in his song &quot;The Wish&quot;. In 1965, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist of The Castiles, and later lead singer of the group. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township, New Jersey and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said that she believed Springsteen when, as a young man, he said he was going to make it big. From 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed around New Jersey with guitarist Steve Van Zandt, organist Danny Federici and drummer Vini Lopez in a band called Child, later renamed Steel Mill. They went on to play the mid-Atlantic college circuit, and also briefly in California. During this time Springsteen also performed regularly at small clubs in Asbury Park and along the Jersey Shore, quickly gathering a cult following. Other acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and songwriting style: Dr Zoom &amp; the Sonic Boom (early-mid 1971), Sundance Blues Band (mid 1971), and The Bruce Springsteen Band (mid 1971-mid 1972). With the addition of pianist David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horns sections, &quot;The Zoomettes&quot; (a group of female backing vocalists for &quot;Dr Zoom&quot;) and Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&amp;B, jazz, church music, early rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, and soul. His profilic songwriting ability, with more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums, brought his skill to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: new managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, and legendary Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond, who, under Appel&#x27;s pressure, auditioned Springsteen in May 1972. Even after gaining international acclaim, Springsteen&#x27;s New Jersey roots reverberated in his music, and he routinely praised &quot;the great state of New Jersey&quot; in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey and Philadelphia venues and, much like the Grateful Dead, his song lists varied significantly from one night to the next. He also made many surprise appearances at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years, becoming the foremost exponent of the Jersey Shore sound. 1972-1974 Springsteen signed a record deal with Columbia Records in 1972, with the help of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same record label a decade earlier. Springsteen brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named as such for a couple more years). His debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, N. J. , released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite, though sales were slow. Because of his lyrics-heavy, folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;For You,&quot; as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. &quot;He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven&#x27;t heard since I was rocked by &#x27;Like a Rolling Stone&#x27;,&quot; wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen&#x27;s first interview/profile, in March, 1973. Crawdaddy &quot;discovered&quot; Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Famed music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem, 1975, that when Springsteen&#x27;s first album was released&#8230;. . &quot;many of us dismissed it: he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison&#x27;s. &quot; The track &quot;Spirit in the Night&quot; especially showed Morrison&#x27;s influence, while with &quot;Lost in the Flood&quot; Springsteen presented the first of his many portraits of Vietnam veterans. In September 1973 his second album, The Wild, the Innocent &amp; the E Street Shuffle was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen&#x27;s songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folky, more R&amp;B vibe and the lyrics often romanticizing teenage street life. &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; and &quot;Incident on 57th Street&quot; would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing &quot;Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)&quot; would rank among Springsteen&#x27;s most beloved concert numbers. In the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston&#x27;s The Real Paper, music critic Jon Landau wrote after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, &quot;I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time. &quot; Landau subsequently became Springsteen&#x27;s manager and producer, helping to finish the epic new album, Born to Run. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of &quot;Born to Run&quot; to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album&#x27;s release. 1975-1981 On August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York&#x27;s Bottom Line club; it attracted major media attention, was broadcast live on WNEW-FM, and convinced many skeptics that Springsteen was for real. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll. ) With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success: while there were no real hit singles, &quot;Born to Run&quot;, &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-out&quot; and &quot;Jungleland&quot; all received massive FM radio airplay and remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations to this day. With its panoramic imagery, thundering production and desperate optimism, some fans consider this among the best rock and roll albums of all time and Springsteen&#x27;s finest work. It established him as a sincere and dynamic rock and roll personality who spoke for and in the voice of a large part of the rock audience. To cap off the triumph, Springsteen appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that Springsteen eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a concert appearance in London. A legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for over two years, during which time he kept The E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U. S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, the new songs he was writing and often debuting on stage had taken a more somber tone than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen finally returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point of Springsteen&#x27;s career. Gone were the rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; now the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen&#x27;s growing intellectual and political awareness. Some fans consider Darkness Springsteen&#x27;s best and most consistent record; tracks such as &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;The Promised Land&quot; became concert staples for decades to come, while the track &quot;Prove It All Night&quot; received a significant amount of radio airplay (#33, Billboard Hot 100). Other fans would prefer the work of the adventurous early Springsteen. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity of its shows. By the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann&#x27;s Earth Band had achieved a U. S. number one pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of Greetings&#x27; &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; in early 1977. Patti Smith reached number 13 with her take on Springsteen&#x27;s unreleased &quot;Because the Night&quot; (which Smith co-wrote) in 1978, while The Pointer Sisters hit number two in 1979 with Springsteen&#x27;s also-unreleased &quot;Fire&quot;. In September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated setlist while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album, as well as the following summer&#x27;s No Nukes documentary film, represented the first official recordings and filmings of Springsteen&#x27;s fabled live act, as well as Springsteen&#x27;s first tentative dip into political involvement. Springsteen continued to consolidate his thematic focus on working-class life with the double album The River in 1980, which finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, &quot;Hungry Heart&quot;, but also included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads. The album sold well, and a long tour in 1980 and 1981 followed, featuring Springsteen&#x27;s first extended playing of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U. S. 1982-1989 Springsteen suddenly veered off the normal rock career course, following The River with the stark solo acoustic Nebraska in 1982. According to the Marsh biographies, Springsteen was in a depressed state when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. The title track on this album is about the murder spree of Charles Starkweather. The album actually started (according to Marsh) as a demo tape for new songs to be played with the E Street Band - but during the recording process, Springsteen and producer Landau realized they worked better as solo acoustic numbers; several attempts at re-recording the songs in a studio led them to realize that the original versions, recorded on a simple, low-tech four-track cassette deck in Springsteen&#x27;s kitchen, were the best versions they were going to get. While Nebraska did not sell especially well, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine&#x27;s critics) and influenced later significant works by other major artists, including U2&#x27;s album, The Joshua Tree. It helped inspire the musical genre known as lo-fi music, becoming a cult favorite among indie-rockers. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with Nebraska&#x27;s release. Springsteen probably is best known for his album Born in the U. S. A. (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U. S. alone and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the top 10, and the massively successful world tour that followed it. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen&#x27;s friends and bandmates. The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. Springsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by Chrysler Corporation for using the song in a car commercial. (In later years, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only with acoustic guitar to make the song&#x27;s original meaning more explicitly clear. An acoustic version also appeared on Tracks, a later album. ) &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U. S. A. , peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The music video for the song featured a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, an appearance which helped kickstart the actress&#x27;s career; a number of the videos for the album were made by noted film directors Brian De Palma or John Sayles. During the Born in the U. S. A. Tour he met actress Julianne Phillips. They were married in Lake Oswego, Oregon, on May 13, 1985 surrounded by intense media attention. Opposites in background, their marriage was not to be long-lived. Springsteen&#x27;s 1987 album Tunnel of Love described some of his unhappinesses in the relationship and during the subsequent Tunnel of Love Express tour, Springsteen took up with backup singer Patti Scialfa, as reported by many tabloids. Subsequently, Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988. The divorce was finalized in 1989. The Born in the U. S. A. period represented the height of Springsteen&#x27;s visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience demographic he would ever reach (this was further helped by releasing Arthur Baker dance mixes of three of the singles). Live/1975-85, a five-record box set (also released on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and also became a huge success, selling 13 million units in the U. S. and becoming the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U. S. album charts. It is one of the best selling live albums of all time. It summed up Springsteen&#x27;s career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen&#x27;s difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long coda to &quot;Racing in the Street&quot;. Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album&#x27;s song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and trading among fans. After this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his first marriage, to Julianne Phillips. Reflecting the challenges of love in Brilliant Disguise, Springsteen sang:  I heard somebody call your name, from underneath our willow. I saw something tucked in shame, underneath your pillow. Well I&#x27;ve tried so hard baby, but I just can&#x27;t see. What a woman like you is doing with me. The subsequent Tunnel of Love Express tour shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements; during the European leg in 1988, Springsteen&#x27;s relationship with E Street Band backup singer Patti Scialfa became public. Later in 1988, Springsteen headlined the truly worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In the fall of 1989, he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California. 1990s Springsteen married Scialfa in 1991; they have three children Evan James (b. 1990), Jessica Rae (b. 1991) and Sam Ryan (b. 1994). In 1992, after risking charges of &quot;going Hollywood&quot; by moving to Los Angeles (a radical move for someone so linked to the blue-collar life of the Jersey Shore) and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were even more introspective than any of his previous work. Also different about these albums was the confidence he displayed. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself. Some E Street Band fans voiced (and continue to voice) a low opinion of these albums, (especially Human Touch), and did not follow the subsequent &quot;Other Band&quot; Tour. For other fans, however, who had only come to know Springsteen after the 1975 consolidation of the E Street Band, the &quot;Other Band&quot; Tour was an exciting opportunity to see Springsteen develop a working onstage relationship with a different group of musicians, and to see him explore the Asbury Park soul-and-gospel base in some of his classic material. It was also during this tour that fans generally became aware of Springsteen using a teleprompter so as to not forget his lyrics, a practice that has continued ever since. An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program (that was later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:  I&#x27;ve gotta thank him because -- what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs - and I tried it in the early &#x27;90s and it didn&#x27;t work; the public didn&#x27;t like it. A multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;, which appeared in the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The song, along with the film, was applauded by many for its sympathetic portrayal of a gay man dying of AIDS. The music video for the song shows Springsteen&#x27;s actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This was a technique developed on the &quot;Brilliant Disguise&quot; video. In 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad. This was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and didactic nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully featured many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet during the performances. Following the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family. In 1998, another precursor to the E Street Band&#x27;s upcoming re-birth appeared in the form of a sprawling, four-disc box set of out-takes, Tracks. In 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band officially came together again and went on the extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey to kick off the American leg of the tour. 2000s Springsteen&#x27;s Reunion Tour with the E Street Band ended with a triumphant ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden in mid-2000 and controversy over a new song, &quot;American Skin (41 Shots)&quot;, about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo. The final shows at Madison Square Garden were recorded and resulted in an HBO Concert, with corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band: Live in New York City. In 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen&#x27;s best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show, The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U. S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U. S. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U. S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close. During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Bruce-oriented online communities had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour came to a final conclusion with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy over &quot;American Skin&quot; and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan. During the 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and he&#x27;s played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations and causes. These shows are explicitly intended for the faithful, featuring numbers such as the unreleased (until Tracks) E Street Shuffle outtake &quot;Thundercrack&quot;, a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even go so far as to stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song &quot;My City of Ruins&quot; was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for a post-Sept. 11 benefit concert honoring New York City, he selected &quot;My City of Ruins,&quot; which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the concert, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to &quot;Rise up!&quot; The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close &quot;The Rising&quot; album and as an encore on the subsequent tour. At the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash&#x27;s &quot;London Calling&quot; along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt in tribute to Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and the triple Sandinista!. In 2004, Springsteen announced that he and the E Street Band would participate in a politically motivated &quot;Vote for Change&quot; tour, in conjunction with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R. E. M. , Bright Eyes, Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in swing states, to benefit MoveOn. org and to encourage people to vote against George W. Bush. A finale was held in Washington, D. C. , bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed - against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, Amnesty International and the Christic Institute - he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan &quot;Born in the U. S. A. &quot; flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;No Surrender&quot; became the main campaign theme song for John Kerry&#x27;s unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies. Springsteen&#x27;s stance coincided with a reduction in his fan base over the next two years, but how much was due to his politics versus his noncommercial music choices was unclear. Devils &amp; Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, a couple of them being performed then but never released. The title track concerns an ordinary soldier&#x27;s feelings and fears during the Iraq War. Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen&#x27;s anti-corporate politics. Nonetheless, the album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo Devils &amp; Dust Tour at the same time as the album&#x27;s release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, ukulele, banjo, electric guitar and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar and percussion also are used for some songs. ) Unearthly renditions of &quot;Reason to Believe&quot;, &quot;The Promised Land&quot;, and Suicide&#x27;s &quot;Dream Baby Dream&quot; jolted audiences to attention, while rarities, frequent set list changes, and a willingness to keep trying even through audible piano mistakes kept most of his loyal audiences happy. In November 2005, New Jersey Senators Frank Lautenberg and Jon Corzine sponsored a U. S. Senate resolution to honor Springsteen on the 30th anniversary of the release of his Born to Run album. In general, resolutions honoring native sons are passed with a simple voice vote. For unstated reasons, this resolution was killed in committee. Also in November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station on Channel 10 called &quot;E Street Radio. &quot; This channel featured commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen &amp; the E Street Band recorded throughout their career. In April 2006, Springsteen released another radical departure, We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians, including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. The Bruce Springsteen with The Seeger Sessions Band Tour began the same month, featuring the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed the Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to the Sessions Band). Seeger Sessions material was heavily featured, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews, but newspapers reported that a number of U. S. shows suffered from sparse attendance. By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the The Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June. Springsteen&#x27;s most recent album, entitled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it featured ten new announced Springsteen songs plus &quot;Long Walk Home,&quot; performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), &quot;Terry&#x27;s Song,&quot; a tribute to Springsteen&#x27;s long-time assistant Terry Magovern who died on July 30, 2007. The first single &quot;Radio Nowhere&quot; was made available for a free download on August 28. On October 7, Magic debuted at number 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the Irish charts at number 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in Norway again. On October 11, 2007 Media Traffic reported that Springsteen&#x27;s Magic sold 563,000 copies around the world in its first week, making it the best-selling record in the world for that particular week. The next world chart saw Bruce remain at the top, selling another 270,000 copies of Magic and bringing the total for that album to 833,000 copies worldwide. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted &quot;E Street Radio&quot; on Channel 10, on September 27, 2007 in anticipation of Magic. Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications reportedly decided to not play the new album, sending an edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material. An accompanying tour with the E Street Band began at the Hartford Civic Center with the album&#x27;s release and was routed to North America and Europe. Springsteen and the band performed live on NBC&#x27;s Today Show in advance of the opener. Springsteen was the musical guest on November 9, 2007 at former-New York Yankees manager Joe Torre&#x27;s &quot;Safe At Home&quot; Foundation&#x27;s 5th annual gala. Yankees&#x27; outfielder Bernie Williams joined Springsteen on stage and contibuted two guitar solos to an impromptu rendition of the Springsteen hit, &quot;Glory Days&quot;. Magic was followed up by a traditionally strong tour throughout 2008, during which original band-member and friend Danny Federici passed away. Federici had already been temporarily replaced by Charlie Giordano, with whom Springsteen played the year before during the Seeger Sessions. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band rounded the 100-show tour at Harley-Davidson's 105th anniversary celebration. On January 27, 2009 Springsteen's twenty-fourth album \"Working on a Dream\" was released. According to the official press release, Working on a Dream was recorded with the E Street Band and features twelve new Springsteen compositions plus two bonus tracks. It is the fourth collaboration between Springsteen and Brendan O'Brien, who produced and mixed the album. A new tour for 2009 is expected to be announced soon. Springsteen and the E Street Band will play The Super Bowl halftime show on February 1, 2009. Springsteen&#x27;s 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. Three songs previously only available as live versions--&quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;, &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot;, and &quot;American Land&quot;--appear on the album. The anthemic up-tempo rocker, &quot;We Take Care Of Our Own&quot; is the album&#x27;s lead single. It finds The Boss singing of patriotism and brotherhood and decrying the broken promises of the government. &quot;Wherever this flag&#x27;s flown, we take care of our own,&quot; he croons. The song was released on January 19, 2012. Springsteen released his eighteenth studio album, High Hopes, on January 14, 2014. The first single and music video was a newly recorded version of the song &quot;High Hopes&quot;, which Springsteen had previously recorded in 1995. The album was the first by Springsteen in which all songs are either cover songs, newly recorded outtakes from previous records, or newly recorded versions of songs previously released. The 2014 E Street Band touring lineup, along with deceased E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, appears on the album along with guitarist Tom Morello. E Street Band The E Street Band is considered to have started in October 1972, even though it was not officially known as such until September 1974. The E Street Band was inactive from the end of 1988 through early 1999, except for a brief reunion in 1995.

Clarence Clemons passed away on on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke. Film connections Springsteen&#x27;s music has long been intertwined with film. It made its first appearance in the 1983 John Sayles&#x27; film Baby, It&#x27;s You, which featured several songs from Born to Run. The relationship Springsteen established with Sayles would re-surface in later years, with Sayles directing videos for songs from Born in the U. S. A. and Tunnel of Love. The song &quot;(Just Around the Corner to the) Light of Day&quot; was written for the early Michael J. Fox/Joan Jett vehicle Light of Day. His work has been used in films (winning him an Oscar for his song &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;). Additionally his 1995 song &quot;Secret Garden&quot; appeared on the soundtrack for the Tom Cruise film Jerry Maguire. In turn, films have been inspired by his music, including The Indian Runner, written and directed by Sean Penn, which Penn has specifically noted as being inspired by Springsteen&#x27;s song &quot;Highway Patrolman&quot;. He was nominated for a second Oscar for &quot;Dead Man Walkin&#x27;&quot;, from the movie Dead Man Walking. In addition, &quot;Lift Me Up&quot; ran over the credits for the John Sayles film Limbo. Bruce also made a cameo appearance in the John Cusack film High Fidelity. In the film, Cusack&#x27;s character, Rob, imagines Springsteen giving him advice on his fractured love life.

She released her first EP, The Love Club EP, in March 2013 and her first single, &quot;Royals&quot;, in June 2013. Her debut album, Pure Heroine, was released on September 27, 2013. She was born in Auckland, New Zealand. Her father, an Irish-New Zealander, is a civil engineer, and her mother, Sonja Yelich, a Croatian-New Zealander, is a prize-winning poet. She was raised in Devonport, a suburb of Auckland. At the age of 12, she was spotted by A&amp;R scout Scott Maclachlan when he saw her singing in a video of a talent show at her school, Belmont Intermediate. Later, when Yelich-O&#x27;Connor was 13, Maclachlan signed her to Universal Music and, at the age of 14, she began working with their songwriters in 2012. Officially released digitally in March 2013 and on CD in May 2013, The Love Club EP features five songs, including the number one hit &quot;Royals&quot;. On May 27 2013, &quot;Royals&quot; was covered on national television on the New Zealand version of The X Factor by all-girl group Gap 5, mentored by Melanie Blatt of the All Saints. &quot;Royals&quot; debuted as a single at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 on 15 March 2013 and remained in the top position for three weeks. In the U. S. it peaked at number 1 on the Hot 100 and number 1 on both the Alternative charts (making Lorde the first female artist since Tracy Bonham to reach the top) and number 1 on the Rock charts, making her the first female artist to top the charts as a lead singer. On 8 May 2013, The Love Club EP debuted in the number 2 position on the album chart. In August 2013, Lorde became the first woman to top the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the United States since Tracy Bonham in 1996. Following the release of &quot;Royals&quot; in the United States in June 2013, 85,000 copies were sold during a single week in July. In a subsequent interview, Lorde stated, &quot;I had a sneaking suspicion that it might do all right&quot; . In November 2013, her song &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; was included on the soundtrack of &quot;the movie &quot;The Hunger Games: Catching Fire&quot; along with tracks from Coldplay, Sia, The Weeknd, Christina Aguilera, Of Monsters and Men, and Imagine Dragons among others. The &quot;Tennis Court&quot; single was released in New Zealand on 8 June 2013. The &quot;Tennis Court EP&quot; was released digitally in the UK on 7 June (due to the timezone difference) and physically on 22 June. It was played during the BBC Sport coverage of the 2013 Wimbledon Championships - Women&#x27;s Singles final. On 14 June 2013, Yelich-O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s second single &quot;Tennis Court&quot; debuted at number 1 on the New Zealand Top 40 singles chart. In the same week, she also became the first New Zealand artist to simultaneously have four songs in the top 20 tracks of the New Zealand Top 40. Previously, Titanium held this record with three songs. 2014 - Major Awards continue Lorde&#x27;s success continued in 2014, picking up major awards at: - the 56th Grammy Awards - &quot;Song of The Year&quot; for &quot;Royals&quot; and also &quot;Best Pop Vocal Performance&quot; (Los Angeles, January 2014). - the BRIT Awards - International Female Solo Artist (London, February 2014). - the inaugural iHeartRadio Awards - Best New Artist (Los Angeles, May 2014). ", "Prince": "Prince Rogers Nelson (born June 7, 1958), known from 1993 to 2000 as an unpronounceable symbol (or, informally, &#x27;The Artist Formerly Known as Prince&#x27;, &#x27;Tafkap&#x27;, &#x27;The Artist&#x27;, etc), is a popular American musician. He had 1984&#x27;s biggest hit song in the U. S. with &quot;When Doves Cry&quot;, and he&#x27;s arguably best known for his album &#x27; Purple Rain &#x27; and his movie of the same name. During the 80s, Prince had comparable success with other &#x27;mega-superstars&#x27; such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, and Madonna in terms of star power and sales. Both individually and with his backing groups &#x27; The Revolution &#x27; and &#x27; The New Power Generation &#x27;, Prince has remained one of the world&#x27;s most bestselling artists, even as his popularity has waned since the mid-90s, Few other musicians have matched the formidable breadth of his talents as a multi-instrumentalist performer, with his skills including not just singing and dancing but also composing, producing, and playing multiple instruments while directing videos and movies. In fact, Prince played nearly all the instruments on his first five albums, and he has produced himself since signing with Warner Bros. as a mere teenager. In terms of style, Prince&#x27;s music has spanned myriad genres and showed a debt to numerous past artists. From his early material, rooted in funk and soul, he has constantly expanded his musical palette throughout his career, absorbing many other genres such as pop, rock, jazz, and hip-hop. In terms of critical acclaim, Prince has won seven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe, and an Academy Award. He was additionally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2004, the first year he was eligible. Born in Minneapolis, he has based his entire career in Minnesota and helped codify what&#x27;s known as the &quot;Minneapolis sound&quot;. He lately has been residing in Los Angeles, California. The distinctive characteristics of the early-to-mid 80s work that raised him to super-stardom involved industrial sounding drum machine arrangements as well as the use of synthesizer riffs to serve the role of horn riffs traditionally used in earlier R&amp;B-related releases. That slick, often smooth musical ethos is known as &quot;the Minneapolis sound&quot;, as referred to before. Prince additionally is famous for his reputation as a workaholic, having released over a thousand songs both under his own name and through other artists, and for having composed and recorded many more songs that remain unreleased. Regarded as a perfectionist, Prince has a reputation as being somewhat difficult to work with and for being highly protective of his music. As referred to before, he writes, composes and produces most of his music single-handed while also playing most of the instruments on his albums. Born at Mount Sinai Hospital in Minneapolis, Minnesota to parents John L. Nelson and Mattie Shaw, he had a somewhat troubled childhood, with his parents divorcing when he was only seven. The story gets started in 1976, when Prince created a demo tape with producer Chris Moon in Moon&#x27;s Minneapolis studio. Having trouble securing a recording contract but seeing clear potential in Prince&#x27;s sound, Moon brought the tape to Minneapolis businessman Owen Husney. Husney signed Prince, at the mere age of seventeen, to a management contract, and he helped Prince create a demo recording at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with producer/engineer David Z. The demo recording, along with a press kit produced at Husney&#x27;s ad agency, resulted in interest from several record companies. With the help of Husney, Prince signed a recording contract with Warner Bros. The label agreed to give Prince creative control for three albums as well as ownership of the publishing rights. Having experienced the local scene while playing in a band called Grand Central along with other students attending Minneapolis&#x27;s Central High School, Prince then aimed for the big time. His first two albums were solid, if unremarkable, late-&#x27;70s funky pop releases. Coming after a move to Sausalito, California, Prince&#x27;s debut studio album, titled &#x27; For You &#x27;, was recorded at Record Plant Studios and released in 1978. With Prince playing all twenty-six instruments featured on the album himself, the aptly titled single &quot;Soft and Wet&quot; became a minor hit and pointed the way forward. With 1980&#x27;s &#x27; Dirty Mind &#x27;, Prince recorded his large-scale hit album, a work regarded by fans and many critics as a one-man tour-de-force of sex and music. The release featured hard-edged funk, catchy melodies reminiscent of The Beatles, soul ballads, and guitar-driven pop rock, all on the same album. Numerous critics have praised the work over the years; for example, Pitchfork Media has ranked &#x27; Dirty Mind &#x27; number 87 on its list of the &#x27;Top 100 Albums of the 1980s&#x27;. The follow-up, &#x27; Controversy &#x27;, continued on with the same musical vibe. With songs wading into social and political commentary, the album&#x27;s cover itself referencing gun control while also quoting the Bible, Prince&#x27;s fans enjoyed the work but felt that he seemed primed for something bigger. In commercial terms, &#x27; 1999 &#x27; was brilliant. The 1982 release, the artist&#x27;s fifth full studio album, blasted Prince into the mainstream pop charts, with over three million copies sold both in the U. S. and internationally in what seemed like no time. Being inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008, &#x27; 1999 &#x27; seemed to showcase a determination to throw genre-labels out the window. The music video for the single &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; proved to be a popular one. It was notably one of the first music videos by an African-American artist to be played on MTV alongside Michael Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot;. Other songs such as &quot;1999&quot; filled dance floors from city to city and showed a synthpop driven side that brought Prince an even larger fan-base. His skilled live tours showcased a group of talented backing musicians that he dubbed &#x27;&#x27; The Revolution &#x27;, including artists that went on to other prominent endeavors. Then came what is regarded as Prince&#x27;s masterpiece, 1984&#x27;s &#x27; Purple Rain &#x27;, which at its height was selling over one million copies per week in the U. S. alone. The release spun off several number one records and top ten hits. All this, not to mention the #1 blockbuster hit movie of the same name, turned Prince from a mere popular performer into an international icon. The &#x27; Purple Rain &#x27; album did so well that it even spent an astonishing 24 weeks at number one. Prince was a mega-superstar; his work had delivered seamlessly. By 1996, said album easily surpassed the esteemed RIAA Diamond Certification (which is earned after selling at least 10 million domestic units). Prince matched his studio acclaim with the eclectic talent of his touring band. He and his group zig-zagged the nation to the delight of his many fans. Prince had plunged himself into a pool of the most pop-oriented music he has ever made, the emotionally thrilling and reflective lyrics in tracks such as &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot; matching their sonic energy. Instead of continuing in this accessible direction, however, Prince and the Revolution decided to shift gears, and the group veered off into the psychedelic rock and avant-garde music inspired world of &#x27; Around the World in a Day &#x27;. Although some commentators opined that Prince&#x27;s success may have already peaked, the album nevertheless zoomed to number one on the album chart and sold over three million copies. Coming out on April 22, 1985, that release contains the critically acclaimed tunes &quot;Raspberry Beret&quot; and &quot;Pop Life&quot;, which were noted for their strong, sophisticated story-telling lyrics and became top 10 hits. As a whole, though, the less pop-friendly album challenged many listeners even while receiving general praise from many music critics. With songs featuring cryptic religious imagery as well as a mixed tapestry of instrumentation, putting chime bells alongside guitars, &#x27; Around the World in a Day &#x27; in retrospect signaled Prince&#x27;s desire to wade into more ambiguous, darker territory exploring personal identity and sexuality as he would do in later works. In 1986, Prince released an album titled &#x27; Parade &#x27;. In its own way, fans viewed it as ambitious and intricate as any art rock exploration of the 60s and 70s. Yet those albums were never grounded with a super hit as brilliant as the spare rock and funk fusion of &quot;Kiss&quot;. Several entities such as &#x27;Rolling Stone&#x27;, &#x27;Billboard&#x27;, and &#x27;New Musical Express&#x27; have ranked the song near the top of their list of the greatest singles of all time. &quot;Kiss&quot; rocketed right to number one (pushing out another huge chart topper by rockers The Bangles, &quot;Manic Monday&quot;, that ironically enough was also composed by Prince) and stayed perched there for several weeks. Prince&#x27;s musical associates, including the female duo Wendy &amp; Lisa, had had the opportunity to shine for themselves, and they played a significant role with the release. Numerous critics ate up the album as a whole, with the &#x27;Detroit Free Press&#x27; speaking for many when the publication called it &quot;a confirmation of Prince&#x27;s place as a superior melodist, arranger, and player, as well as a celebration of his creativity. &quot; &#x27; Parade &#x27; sold several million copies, particularly doing well in Europe, and was used as the soundtrack to Prince&#x27;s second movie. However, that film, titled &#x27; Under The Cherry Moon &#x27;, proved to be a complete bomb. The casting of Prince as a villain, a vindictive swindler no less, provided a stark contrast to the heroic, coming-of-age role of Prince in the &#x27; Purple Rain &#x27; flick. The film ended up failing to even earn back its budget. Though somewhat chastened, Prince still felt immense ambitions musically and visually. The artist, his dreams growing by leaps and bounds, felt inspired to release a double-album. Having an &#x27;everything but the kitchen sink&#x27; ethos around him in terms of lyrics and style, the backing group &#x27;The Revolution&#x27; going of the picture as it disbanded. as well, Prince released the sprawling masterpiece &#x27; Sign o&#x27; the Times &#x27; on March 31, 1987. Numerous critics have praised the work. For instance, it earned the #16 rank in &#x27;New Musical Express&#x27; magazine&#x27;s list of the &#x27;All Time Top 100 Albums&#x27; as well as the #3 slot in &#x27;Hot Press&#x27; magazine&#x27;s list of the &#x27;100 Best Albums of All Time&#x27;. Prince had embraced a musical vibe enriched with socially conscious commentary and a soulful pop style. However, he felt inspired to undertake another hard turn with his next work, once again veering off into another direction. Prince became set to release the abrasive funk of &#x27; The Black Album &#x27; by the end of the year, a album featuring negative elements from casual profanity to lyrics detailing a murder. Yet Prince withdrew the album just before its full release, deciding it was too dark and immoral after what he later described as a spiritual epiphany. The aborted album has since been a popular bootleg item, eventually receiving a belated formal release years later. Instead, Prince released the confused &#x27; Lovesexy &#x27; in 1988. Though not received as well as his previous material, with its cover (featuring Prince in the buff) becoming an object of ridicule, it remains a fan favorite and has picked up several staunch critical defenders. The soundtrack to 1989&#x27;s &#x27; Batman &#x27; rejuvenated Prince&#x27;s fortunes; he returned to the top of the charts with gusto. Even if the album was essentially a recap of everything he had done before, Prince had left his stamp on a cultural icon with a timeless appeal. The blockbuster film itself, as much a part of cinema history as &#x27; Purple Rain &#x27;, even featured the iconic villain the Joker dancing to Prince&#x27;s track &quot;Partyman&quot;. The following year, Prince released &#x27; Graffiti Bridge &#x27;, the soundtrack to the film of the same name. That movie, a sequel to &#x27; Purple Rain &#x27;, turned out to be a considerable disappointment. On the other hand, the album picked up serious acclaim, viewed as a return to the catchy punch of Prince&#x27;s mid-80s work. The release hit the number one slot on the U. K. Albums Chart and also did very well domestically. In 1991, Prince formed what he dubbed &quot;The New Power Generation&quot;, the most versatile backing group that he has ever assembled. With their first album, &#x27; Diamonds and Pearls &#x27;, Prince reasserted his mastery of contemporary R&amp;B. The album became his biggest hit since 1985, with the song &quot;Cream&quot; being a worldwide smash and countless fans loving the vibrant soulful ethos of the work. Other tunes such as &quot;Money Don&#x27;t Matter 2 Night&quot; and &quot;Diamonds and Pearls&quot; earned major praise. On October 13, 1992, Prince released his twelfth studio album, which was titled with a cryptic symbol; in 1993, Prince legally changed his name to the symbol (dubbed by many as &#x27;the love symbol&#x27;). Even longtime fans appeared baffled by the artist&#x27;s behavior. Though ever the eccentric, Prince succeeded, with New Power Generation group fueling his desires, to create a new master-work. Exploring elements of hip-hop as well as dance pop and more, &#x27; The Love Symbol Album &#x27; earned huge support from many critics, with Allmusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine aptly remarking that the album &quot;has some of the finest, most inventive music of Prince&#x27;s career. &quot; In 1994, after becoming embroiled in contract disagreements with Warner Bros. , he independently released the single &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,&quot; likely to illustrate what he would be capable of on his own. The song became his biggest hit single in years. Later that summer, Warner released the halfhearted &#x27; Come &#x27; under the name of Prince. The record was a moderate success commercially, yet its mediocre sound and the fractious situation behind its creation seemed to darkly portend how Prince&#x27;s career would proceed. In November 1994, as part of a contractual obligation, Prince agreed to the official release of the aforementioned work &#x27; The Black Album &#x27;. The artist&#x27;s concerns about the album proved right as many fans didn&#x27;t quite know what to make of it. In early 1995, he immersed himself in another legal battle with Warner, feeling animated enough about the conflict to appear in public with the word &quot;slave&quot; on his cheek. Prince&#x27;s business-related issues fueled anticipation for when his new record, titled &#x27; The Gold Experience &#x27;, would finally see a release. By the end of the summer, a fed-up Warner had negotiated a compromise which guaranteed the album&#x27;s release, plus one final record for the label. &#x27; The Gold Experience &#x27; came out in the fall. Although it received rave reviews and had a smash single to support it, the release failed to catch fire commercially as much as some of his previous albums. However, it remains a fan favorite for many Prince aficionados. Singles &quot;I Hate U&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot; also became popular hits due to their infectious feel. In the summer of 1996, Prince released &#x27; Chaos &amp; Disorder &#x27;, which freed him to become an independent artist. The album received somewhat of a fractious response. Its title aptly labeled it as a messy rock and roll inspired release, with the album pleasing listeners yet failing to achieve have the magic of his previous 90s work in the view of many critics. Setting up his own label, NPG (which was distributed by EMI), Prince resurfaced later that same year with the three-disc &#x27; Emancipation &#x27;, which was designed as a new magnum opus that would spin off singles for several years and be supported with several tours. However, even his devoted following needed considerable time to digest such an enormous compilation of songs, and Prince&#x27;s ability to appeal to the musical mainstream seemed to have faded. Once it was clear that &#x27; Emancipation &#x27; wasn&#x27;t the commercial blockbuster that he hoped it would be, Prince assembled a long-awaited collection of outtakes and unreleased material, titling it &#x27; Crystal Ball &#x27;, in 1998. With &#x27; Crystal Ball &#x27;, Prince discovered that it&#x27;s much more difficult to get records to an audience than it seems. Some fans who pre-ordered their copies through Prince&#x27;s website (from which a bonus fifth disc was included) didn&#x27;t receive them until months after the set began appearing in stores. Prince then released a new one-man album, called &#x27; New Power Soul &#x27; (also known as &#x27; Newpower Soul &#x27;, just three months after &#x27; Crystal Ball &#x27;. Even though it was his most straightforward album musically in several years, it didn&#x27;t do well on the charts, partly because many listeners didn&#x27;t realize it had been released. Despite being a gigantic figure in the music world during the 80s and into much of the 90s, the esoteric nature of Prince&#x27;s work and the scatter-shot nature of its releases proved to be signs that his commercial success and impact on popular culture had significantly waned. Several critics panned &#x27; New Power Soul &#x27; as a pleasant yet pedestrian listen that showed the former master just going through the motions. Numerous fans considered it his worst album, an assessment still held years later. A year later, with &quot;1999&quot; predictably an end-of-the-millennium anthem, Prince prominently issued a new remix collection featuring the still appealing track. Though at the heels of what seemed like a substantial return to fame, a great deal of listeners felt hungry for brand-new material from Prince rather than mere remixes. He additionally aliened many fans by suing a popular fan magazine based on his work. A collection of Warner Bros. -era leftovers, &#x27; Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale &#x27;, received an August 24, 1999 release. On November 9, 1999, Prince came out with &#x27; Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic &#x27;, a release paring him with many famous fellow musicians. Neither album appeared to quite catch on. In the fall of 2001, the artist released the controversial &#x27; Rainbow Children &#x27; album, a jazz-infused circus of sound trumpeting his conversion to the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses religious sect that left many long time fans out in the cold. Though religious and spiritual material were far from rare in Prince&#x27;s previous work, the nature of his preaching and the overall tone of the release turned off general audiences as well. Some commentators opined that he had reached a point in which he had decided to record music only for himself and not for anyone else. Prince further isolated himself with 2003&#x27;s &#x27; N. E. W. S. &#x27;, a four-song set of instrumental jams unlike the vast majority of his past releases. Several critics remarked that the album sounded a lot more fun to play than to listen to. With a great number of fans (and critics) alike considering it his second worst or very worst release ever, Prince&#x27;s fortunes appeared to have changed irrevocably. Thankfully, Prince re-bounded with the chart-topping &#x27; Musicology &#x27;, a return to form that found the artist back in the top ten. He re-embraced the same vibrant, soul and rnb fueled sound that had brought him large scale success back in the early 90s. In 2004, Prince was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and he additionally performed at the Grammy Awards with fellow star Beyonce Knowles. On December 9, 2005, the news came out that Prince had devised an agreement with Universal Records to release his next album, titled &#x27; 3121 &#x27;. This deal, commentators remarked, seemed similar to that which the artist had struck with Columbia Records for &#x27; Musicology &#x27;. The debut single put forward from the album was the Latin-tinged \"Te Amo Corazon,\" the video for which debuted on VH1 on December 13, and was directed by actress Salma Hayek. The piece was filmed in Marrakesh, and showed Prince accompanied on-screen by Mia Maestro. She was also present at a brief press conference which Prince made in promotion of the new single and video. The video for \"Black Sweat,\" the second single from &#x27; 3121 &#x27;, premiered on February 2, 2006, demonstrating a rather more minimalist approach both in the sound of the song and the style of the video. As well in February 2006, Prince was the musical guest on Saturday Night Live, coming in after a 25 year gap between appearances, where he performed two new songs. The guitar-driven \"Fury\" joined the tune \"Beautiful, Loved &amp; Blessed&quot;, the latter featuring the then up-and-coming R&amp;B singer Tamar. Both songs being featured on &#x27; 3121 &#x27;, Prince consented to \"Beautiful, Loved &amp; Blessed\" also appearing on Tamar's album of the same title. That same month, Prince performed at the Brit awards alongside Wendy, Lisa and Sheila E, wowing the crowd with was generally regarded as the best performance of the night. &#x27; 3121 &#x27; ended-up giving Prince his first career number-one debut on the Billboard 200, impressing fans and reassuring general audiences that his comeback would not be temporary. The set sold 183,000 copies in the U. S. alone in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. It also debuted at number one on Billboard's Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart as well as the number one spot on Billboard&#x27;s European Top 100 Albums chart the following week, giving the legendary artist his highest charting international album of the decade. On May 24, 2006, Prince performed the songs \"Lolita\" and \"Satisfied\" on the last results show of the fifth season of American Idol. He was the only artist to perform without any contestant in the episode. The infamous judge on the show, Simon Cowell, turned his barbed comments toward the artist. In regard to Prince's late arrival and abrupt departure, Cowell remarked, \"It just tells you how selfish he is. He comes on, not a word--'I'm not gonna sing with anybody else, I'm not gonna say goodbye. ' Thank you for your generosity, Prince. \" On June 12, 2006, Prince was hono(u)red with a Webby Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of his &quot;visionary&quot; use of the Internet that included becoming the first major artist to release an entire album--1997&#x27;s &quot;Crystal Ball&quot;--exclusively on the Web. &quot;Everything you think is true,&quot; Prince said, coming in under the five-word limit and leaving everyone wondering what he meant as he launched into a solo number. The performance ended abruptly as he suddenly chucked his guitar back over his head with a crash and raced off to a waiting limousine. On June 27, 2006, Prince appeared at the BET awards. He was awarded Best Male R&amp;B artist. In his acceptance speech he told the crowd that he was surprised but honored to receive the award. He also thanked Jehovah, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, India. Arie, and Yolanda Adams. Later in the evening Prince participated in a tribute to Chaka Khan with the other artists he had named in his speech. The tribute was part of Chaka Khan&#x27;s lifetime acheievement award given to her that evening. Prince also closed the show, alongside Tamar, with his song &quot;3121&quot; from his album of the same name. He was joined onstage by musician will. i. am from The Black Eyed Peas. On June 28, 2007, the UK national newspaper &#x27;The Mail On Sunday&#x27; revealed that it had made a deal to give Prince&#x27;s new album Planet Earth away for free with an &quot;imminent&quot; edition of the paper, making it the first place in the world to get the album. The date chosen was July 15, 2007. This move has sparked controversy among music distributors and has also led the UK arm of Prince&#x27;s distributor, Sony BMG, to withdraw from distributing the album in UK stores. The UK&#x27;s largest high street music retailer, HMV, decided to stock the paper on release day due to the giveaway. Last year in the summer, he played 21 nights over 2 months in London&#x27;s o2 Arena including many aftershow parties where he would play for up to 3 hours. He recently released a book called &quot;21 Nights&quot; which featured professional photos of the concerts, photoshoots and poems written by Prince himself. In the spring of 2009 Prince released two albums: LOtUSFLOW3R and MPLSoUND. He released two new albums in 2014; one solo -Art Official Girl - and PLECTRUMELECTRUM with 3rdeyegirl. Looking backward, few artists have created a body of work as rich and as varied as Prince. His genius is critically agreed. He emerged during the 80s as one of the singular talents of the modern musical era, capable of seamlessly tying together pop, funk, rock and more. Not only did he release a series of ground-breaking albums, he toured frequently, produced albums and wrote songs for many other artists. As well, he has recorded hundreds of songs that still lie unreleased in his vaults. With each album he has released, Prince has shown remarkable stylistic growth and musical diversity, constantly experimenting with different sounds, textures, and genres. Occasionally, his music can be maddeningly inconsistent because of this eclecticism, but his experiments frequently succeed. Few other contemporary artists can blend so many diverse styles into a cohesive whole, and numerous listeners await Prince&#x27;s next work. ", "Daft Punk": "Daft Punk is a multi Grammy Award-winning electronic music duo formed in 1994 in Paris, France, and consisting of French musicians Thomas Bangalter (born 3 January 1975) and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo (born 8 February 1974). The band is considered one of the most successful electronic music collaborations of all time, both in album sales and in critical acclaim. Daft Punk reached significant popularity in the late 90s house movement in France , along with other artists such as Air, Cassius, and Dimitri From Paris. Daft Punk are credited with producing songs that were considered essential in the French house scene. They were managed from 1996 to 2008 by Pedro Winter (Busy P), the head of Ed Banger Records. The group released four studio albums: Homework (1997), Discovery (2001), Human After All (2005), and Random Access Memories (2013). They also released the soundtrack album TRON: Legacy (2010); the live albums Alive 1997 (2002), Alive 2007 (2007); the compilation Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 (2006); the remix albums Daft Club (2003), Human After All: Remixes (2006), TRON: Legacy Reconfigured (2011). Early years (1987-1993) Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo met in 1987 on the grounds of the Lycee Carnot, a secondary school in Paris. The two became good friends and later recorded demo tracks with others from the school. This eventually led to the formation of the guitar-based group Darlin&#x27; with Laurent Brancowitz in 1992. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo played bass and guitar, respectively, while Brancowitz performed on drums. The trio had branded themselves after The Beach Boys song of the same name, which they covered along with an original composition. Stereolab released both tracks on a multi-artist Duophonic Records EP and invited the band to open for stage shows in the United Kingdom. Bangalter felt that &quot;The rock n&#x27; roll thing we did was pretty average, I think. It was so brief, maybe six months, four songs and two gigs and that was it. &quot; A negative review in Melody Maker subsequently dubbed the music &quot;a bunch of daft punk. &quot; Instead of dismissing the review, Bangalter and de Homem-Christo found it to be amusing. As the latter stated, &quot;We struggled so long to find Darlin&#x27;, and this happened so quickly. &quot; Darlin&#x27; soon disbanded, leaving Brancowitz to pursue other efforts with Phoenix. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo formed Daft Punk and experimented with drum machines and synthesizers. Homework era (1993-1999) In 1993 Daft Punk attended a rave at EuroDisney, where they met Stuart Macmillan of Slam, co-founder of the label Soma Quality Recordings. The demo tape given to Macmillan at the rave formed the basis for Daft Punk&#x27;s debut single, &quot;The New Wave&quot;, a limited release in 1994. The single also contained the final mix of &quot;The New Wave&quot; called &quot;Alive&quot;. Daft Punk returned to the studio in May 1995 to record &quot;Da Funk&quot;. It became their first commercially successful single the same year. After the success of &quot;Da Funk&quot;, Daft Punk looked to find a manager. They had no trouble finding one at the time as they chose Pedro Winter, who regularly promoted them and other artists at his Hype night clubs. The band signed with Virgin Records in September 1996 and made a deal through which they licensed their tracks to the major label through their production company, Daft Trax. &quot;Da Funk&quot; and &quot;Alive&quot; were later included on Daft Punk&#x27;s 1997 debut album Homework . The album was regarded as an innovative synthesis of techno, house, acid house and electro styles, and is widely acknowledged as one of the most influential dance music albums of the nineties. &quot;Da Funk&quot; was also included on The Saint film soundtrack. It was during this period of change in dance music that Daft Punk became largely successful. They combined the aforementioned music styles and elements of rave that were crowd pleasers. The most successful single from Homework was &quot;Around the World&quot;, which is known for the repeating chant of the song&#x27;s title. Daft Punk also produced a series of music videos for Homework directed by Spike Jonze , Michel Gondry , Roman Coppola and Seb Janiak. The collection of videos was released in 1999 and titled D. A. F. T. - A Story about Dogs, Androids, Firemen and Tomatoes . Discovery era (1999-2004) By 1999 the duo were well into the recording sessions for their second album, which had begun a year earlier. 2001&#x27;s Discovery took on a slicker and distinctly synthpop-oriented style, initially stunning fans of Daft Punk&#x27;s previous material in Homework . The group states that the album was conceived as an attempt to reconnect with a playful, open-minded attitude associated with the discovery phase of childhood. This accounts for the heavy use of themes and samples from the late &#x27;70s to early &#x27;80s era on the album. It reached #2 in the United Kingdom, and its single &quot;One More Time&quot; was a major club hit, creating a new generation of fans mainly familiar with the second Daft Punk release. The singles &quot;Digital Love&quot; and &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; were also very successful in the UK and on the United States dance chart, and &quot;Face to Face&quot; hit #1 on the USA club play charts despite a limited single release. A 45-minute excerpt from a Daftendirektour performance recorded at Birmingham, UK in 1997 was also released in 2001, entitled Alive 1997 . 2003 first saw the release of the feature-length animated film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem . Daft Punk produced the film under the supervision of Leiji Matsumoto, whom they have said is their childhood hero. The album Daft Club was also released to promote the film. It features a collection of remixes previously made available through an online membership service of the same name. Human After All era (2004-present) Starting on September 13 and ending November 9, 2004, Daft Punk devoted six weeks to creating new material. The duo released the album Human After All in March 2005. Reviews were mixed, mostly citing its overly repetitive nature and seemingly rushed recording. The singles taken from this album were &quot;Robot Rock&quot;, &quot;Technologic&quot;, &quot;Human After All&quot; and &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot;. The earliest official statement from Daft Punk concerning the album was &quot;we believe that Human After All speaks for itself. &quot; A Daft Punk anthology CD/DVD entitled Musique Vol. 1 1993-2005 was released on 4 April 2006. It contains new music videos for &quot;The Prime Time of Your Life&quot; and &quot;Robot Rock (Maximum Overdrive)&quot;. Daft Punk also released a remix album of Human After All called Human After All: Remixes . A limited edition included two kubricks of Daft Punk as robots. On 21 May 2006, Daft Punk premiered their first directed film, Daft Punk&#x27;s Electroma at the Cannes Film Festival sidebar Director&#x27;s Fortnight. The film does not include their own music, which is a first for the duo considering their previous DVD and film releases (D. A. F. T. for Homework and Interstella 5555 for Discovery ). Midnight screenings of the film were shown in Paris theaters starting from the end of March 2007. Daft Punk released their second live album titled Alive 2007 on 19 November 2007. It contains the duo&#x27;s performance in Paris from their Alive 2007 tour. The album includes a 50-page book showcasing photographs shot while on tour. The live version of &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot; from Alive 2007 was released as a single. A music video for the single directed by Olivier Gondry features footage shot by 250 audience members at Daft Punk&#x27;s Brooklyn appearance at KeySpan Park, Coney Island. In 2007 Daft Punk also debuted in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine in position 71. Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. Influences Bangalter and de Homem-Christo have credited many sources that influenced their musical style. Years before producing electronic music as a duo, they were stated to have shared tastes for Elton John, MC5, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys and The Stooges. Their mutual admiration for rock bands led to the founding of their own independent project, Darlin&#x27;. Bangalter expressed that &quot;It was still maybe more a teenage thing at that time. It&#x27;s like, you know, everybody wants to be in a band. &quot;They drew inspiration from the rock and acid house displayed in the United Kingdom during the early 1990s. De Homem-Christo pointed to Screamadelica by Primal Scream as an influential work, as the record &quot;put everything together&quot; in terms of genre. The liner notes of Homework pay tribute to a large number of musical artists and contains a quote from Brian Wilson. Bangalter expressed that &quot;In Brian Wilson&#x27;s music you could really feel the beauty - it was very spiritual. Like Bob Marley, too. &quot; When questioned on the success of Daft Punk&#x27;s debut album and rising popularity of their associated musical genre, Bangalter responded, &quot;before us you had Frankie Knuckles or Juan Atkins and so on. The least you can do is pay respect to those who are not known and who have influenced people. &quot; The Daft Punk track &quot;Teachers&quot; on Homework refers to several influences including Romanthony and Todd Edwards. De Homem-Christo stated that &quot;Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions -- the compression, the sound of the kick drum and Romanthony&#x27;s voice, the emotion and soul -- is part of how we sound today. &quot; Romanthony and Edwards later collaborated with Daft Punk in tracks for Discovery . For the album Daft Punk focused on new styles of electronic music. A major inspiration was the Aphex Twin single &quot;Windowlicker&quot;, which was &quot;neither a purely club track nor a very chilled-out, down-tempo relaxation track&quot; according to Bangalter. The duo also utilized vintage equipment to recreate the sound of a previous artist. As stated by de Homem-Christo, &quot;On &#x27;Digital Love&#x27; you get this Supertramp vibe on the bridge,&quot; which was generated through an in-studio Wurlitzer piano. During a later interview, de Homem-Christo clarified that &quot;we didn&#x27;t make a list of artists we like and copy their songs. &quot; Visual components Daft Punk are noted for their use of visual components associated with their musical productions. The music videos for their singles from Homework featured memorable characters and placed emphasis on storytelling instead of musical performance. The album Discovery subsequently became the soundtrack to Interstella 5555. Their outward personae have also changed over time. During their Homework years, the duo would usually wear masks to hide their appearance. When not wearing disguises, they occasionally preferred to be replaced by animation (as they appeared in The Work of Director Michel Gondry DVD) or have their faces digitally obscured for press kits. Very few photos of the duo&#x27;s faces exist, including a blurry one found in the Homework liner notes. In their more visible Discovery years, they have appeared as futuristic robots for publicity photo shoots, interviews, live shows and music videos. These suits, engineered by Tony Gardner and Alterian, Inc. , sport complicated helmets capable of various LED effects and metallic finger gloves. Daft Punk introduced the costumes to many U. S. television viewers through an advertisement for a special presentation of their videos during Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block. Thomas Bangalter once stated, &quot;We did not choose to become robots. There was an accident in our studio. We were working on our sampler, and at exactly 9:09 a. m. on September 9, 1999, it exploded. When we regained consciousness, we discovered that we had become robots. &quot; During a video interview shot in Japan, Daft Punk stated that they donned their robot masks to easily merge the characteristics of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later admitted that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. &quot;But then it became exciting from the audiences&#x27; point of view. It&#x27;s the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower. &quot; When asked on whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated &quot;No, we don&#x27;t need to. It&#x27;s not about having inhibitions. It&#x27;s more like an advanced version of glam, where it&#x27;s definitely not you. &quot; With the release of Human After All , the musical duo&#x27;s outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of dark leather jumpsuits and simplified versions of the Discovery head gear. The jumpsuits were designed by Hedi Slimane. During the filming and promotion of Daft Punk&#x27;s Electroma, the duo went to great lengths to avoid showing their faces. While on the set of the film, the duo chose to be interviewed with their backs turned. As reported on October 2006, the band went as far as to wear black cloth over their heads during a televised interview. It is believed that the mystery of their identity and the elaborate nature of their disguises has added to their popularity. The iconic status of the robotic costumes has been compared to the makeup of KISS and the leather jacket worn by Iggy Pop. Bangalter stated, &quot;The mask gets very hot, but after wearing it as long as I have, I am used to it. &quot; Live performances In the mid-to-late nineties, Daft Punk performed live without costumes in many places including the United States. In particular, a rare bootlegged video featuring the duo in Wisconsin matches the verified identity of Thomas Bangalter. Less clearly seen, Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo is to Bangalter&#x27;s right and is mostly cut off from the camera. Comparing the artwork packaging of Homework to the video footage, one can verify that the album&#x27;s liner note photo was taken during this event. In the fall of 1997 they did their Daftendirektour to promote Homework in several cities throughout the world. For this tour Daft Punk opted to utilize their home studio equipment for the live stage instead of creating a more conventional DJ set. As Bangalter stated, &quot;Everything was synched up -- the drum machines, the bass lines. The sequencer was just sending out the tempos and controlling the beats and bars. On top of this structure we built all these layers of samples and various parts that we could bring in whenever we wanted to. &quot; 25 May 1997 saw them perform at the Tribal Gathering festival at Luton Hoo, England, headlining with Orbital and Kraftwerk. Also of note is the November 8 performance in Birmingham, UK, from which came the recording of Alive 1997 . At the start of 2006, Daft Punk announced plans for a number of special summer shows. On 29 April Daft Punk performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival where they received a jubilant reception for their first U. S. performance since 1997. Thomas Bangalter had initially been reported as saying that there would be a DVD of their recent live set. He later emphasized his reluctance for such a release, as the duo felt that online amateur videos of their performances were more compelling than anything captured professionally. In an interview with the Miami Herald Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo stated that their November 11 appearance at the Bang Music Festival was their final for 2006 and that Daft Punk would conduct more performances in the future. The band later specified a date for a live show at Bercy, Paris for June 2007. Also reported were dates at the Rock Ness Festival and Wireless Festival in June, the Oxegen festival in July and Lollapalooza in August. Daft Punk then announced a world tour called Alive 2007. Daft Punk played at the Rock Ness Festival by the banks of Loch Ness, Scotland on 10 June 2007 as the headline act in the 10,000 capacity Clash tent. To the crowds displeasure, the show was delayed, but the crowd gave the duo a jubilant welcome when they appeared. Due to popularity, part of the tent was removed to allow thousands of people outside to see the show. On 16 June 2007 Daft Punk successfully headlined the third day of the O2 Wireless Festival to positive reaction and reviews. The Times described the set as a &quot;memorable sensory spectacle, both dazzling and deafening&quot; and ThisisLondon declared it &quot;an almost faultless set of relentless electro euphoria&quot;. Daft Punk headlined Stage 2/NME Stage at the Oxegen music festival on 8 July 2007. Their live set was preceded by a showing of the trailer for the film Daft Punk&#x27;s Electroma. Subsequent reports stated that the Daft Punk appearance was the highlight of the festival. NME expressed that the performance was &quot;a robotic spectacular&quot;, while Shoutmouth described the set as &quot;typically triumphant&quot;. Four days later, the duo played at Traffic Torino Free Festival in Parco della Pellerina in Turin, Italy . Daft Punk headlined the AT&amp;T stage on 3 August 2007, the first night of the Lollapalooza music festival in Chicago . Their show there was praised by Pitchfork Media stating that the experience of watching the performance &quot;was a much-needed reminder of the still-potent power of communicative pop. &quot; On August 9 they performed at KeySpan Park in Brooklyn , New York . Daft Punk composed the music for the Louis Vuitton Spring/Summer 2008 Womenswear Full Show on 7 October 2007. The duo also headlined the Vegoose festival in Las Vegas on 27 October. They appeared at the festival along with bands Rage Against the Machine, Muse and Queens of the Stone Age. At the end of the month, Daft Punk performed in Mexico City. The duo also performed on Friday November 2, 2007 at the Arena Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico. Modular announced that Daft Punk would appear in Australia for an event in December 2007 called Never Ever Land. The announcement addressed years of speculation on whether Daft Punk would visit Australia for live performances. Never Ever Land included Australian acts The Presets, Cut Copy, Muscles, Van She and the Bang Gang Deejays. Daft Punk were supported by their regular acts SebastiAn and Kavinsky at the appearances, which had been announced as an extension to the Alive 2007 tour. Never Ever Land toured to Melbourne at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, Perth at the Esplanade, Brisbane at the Riverstage and finally Sydney at the Sydney Showground Main Arena. A Triple J interview with Pedro Winter (Busy P) revealed that Daft Punk&#x27;s Sydney appearance on December 22 would be their final show for 2007 and the last to feature the pyramid light scheme. Tickets for the Australian tour sold more quickly than for any Daft Punk-related event in their history. The duo stated in an EMI-sponsored live webchat that there will be no tour performances for 2008, and that they would instead focus on new projects. Daft Punk made a surprise appearance at the 50th Grammy Awards on February 10, 2008. The duo appeared with Kanye West to perform a reworked version of &quot;Stronger&quot; on stage at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. For the appearance, Daft Punk utilized four JazzMutant Lemur controllers. A press release specified that this was the first televised live performance by the duo in their career. Bangalter&#x27;s wife, Elodie Bouchez, also attended the event. Following the Alive 2007 tour, Daft Punk focused on other projects. A 2008 interview with Pedro Winter revealed that the duo returned to their Paris studio to work on new material. Winter also stepped down from managing Daft Punk to focus attention on his Ed Banger Records label and his work as Busy P. He stated in a later interview that the duo are working with an unspecified management company in Los Angeles. In 2008, Daft Punk placed 38th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after debuting at position 71 in the year before. On 8 February 2009, Daft Punk won Grammy Awards for Alive 2007 and its single &quot;Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger&quot;. Daft Punk in DJ Hero Daft Punk provided eleven new mixes featuring their music for the video game DJ Hero. They also appear in the game as playable characters, along with their own venue. The duo appear wearing their Discovery-era helmets and Human After All-era leather attire. Daft Punk&#x27;s playable likenesses are absent from the sequel DJ Hero 2, which includes a remixed version of their song &quot;Human After All&quot;. At the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that the duo composed 24 tracks for the film Tron: Legacy. Daft Punk&#x27;s score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese. The band collaborated with him for two years on the score, from pre-production to completion. The score features an 85-piece orchestra, recorded at AIR Lyndhurst Studios in London. Joseph Kosinski, director of the film, referred to the score as being a mixture of orchestral and electronic elements. Daft Punk also make a cameo appearance as disc jockey programs wearing their trademark robot masks within the film&#x27;s virtual world. Tron: Legacy co-star Olivia Wilde stated that the duo may be involved with future promotional events related to the film. A teaser trailer features Daft Punk and their track &quot;Derezzed&quot; from Tron: Legacy. The soundtrack album of the film was released on 6 December 2010. A deluxe 2-disc edition of the album was also released that includes a poster of the duo from the film. Additional bonus tracks are also available through various online vendors. An official music video for &quot;Derezzed&quot;, with a running time of less than two minutes, also premiered on the MTV Networks on the same day the album was released. The video, which features Olivia Wilde as Quorra in specially shot footage, along with images of Daft Punk in Flynn&#x27;s Arcade, was later made available for purchase from the iTunes Store and included in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of the film. Walt Disney Records released a remix album of the score titled Tron: Legacy Reconfigured on 5 April 2011. In 2010 Daft Punk were admitted into the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, an order of merit of France. Bangalter and de Homem-Christo were individually awarded the rank of Chevalier (knight). Soma Records released a previously unpublished Daft Punk track called &quot;Drive&quot; that was made during the same time the duo was still with Soma Records and recording &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Scratchin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Da Funk&quot;. The track was included in a 20th anniversary multi-artist compilation of the Soma label. In October 2011, Daft Punk placed 28th in a worldwide official poll of DJ Magazine after appearing at position 44 in the year before. On 19 January 2012, Daft Punk ranked No. 2 on Mixmag&#x27;s Greatest Dance Acts of All Time, with The Prodigy at No. 1 by just a few points. In October 2012, Daft Punk provided a fifteen-minute mix of songs by blues musician Junior Kimbrough for Hedi Slimane&#x27;s Yves Saint Laurent fashion show. The duo also placed 44th in DJ Magazine&#x27;s annual Top 100 DJs list. Daft Punk is currently working on their forthcoming album in collaboration with singer-songwriter Paul Williams and Chic frontman Nile Rodgers. Williams mentioned the collaboration in two separate interviews, and that the project has been in production since 2010. During an interview with Rodgers, he stated that he would meet with Daft Punk to discuss the duo&#x27;s upcoming album. Rodgers later said that he and Daft Punk had an informal jam session when they met, and that a formal collaboration would be undertaken. Although Williams stated that Daft Punk&#x27;s new album could be released as early as June 2012, it was later confirmed that this would not be the case. In May 2012 it was announced that Giorgio Moroder had collaborated with the duo, recording a monologue about his life in a vocal booth containing microphones ranging from the 1960s to present day. When asked, the engineer responded that each mic was used to represent the different decades of Moroder&#x27;s life in his monologue. Rodgers was also present during the recording session. Chilly Gonzales stated in an interview that he had performed material for the duo&#x27;s project in a one-day session: &quot;I played for hours and they're gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever. &quot; He also said that the album would be released &quot;next spring&quot;. In an interview conducted on 28 November 2012 with Fourplay member Nathan East, he said to have collaborated with the duo on the project. In this interview, it is also implied that the album will be available in CD format. On 4 January 2013, Nile Rodgers talked about his number of collaborations to be released in 2013 on his blog, and also stated &quot;The next time foot in Japan, collaboration with Daft Punk would have started to hit people&#x27;s eardrums&quot;. http://www. daftpunk. com http://www. daftalive. com", "Flying Lotus": "Los Angeles resident Steven Ellison, better known as Flying Lotus, is a producer of electronic music and hip-hop beats, known for his abstract and sometimes jazz-tinted style.

Formed in 2003, the band is composed of vocalist and guitarist John D. Cronise, guitarist Kyle Shutt, bassist Bryan Richie, and drummer Santiago &quot;Jimmy&quot; Vela III. Originally signed to New York-based independent label Kemado Records, the group released its debut album Age of Winters, which was largely written by Cronise before the band&#x27;s formation, in 2006. The follow-up, Gods of the Earth, was released two years later, and gave the group its first entry on the US Billboard 200 chart. In 2010 the band released Warp Riders, a concept album centered on an original science fiction narrative, which marked the first time the band had enlisted an external producer (Matt Bayles). Original drummer Trivett Wingo left the group later in the year, and was replaced briefly by Kevin Fender before Vela joined in 2011. After leaving Kemado and signing with Razor &amp; Tie in early 2012, the group released its fourth album Apocryphon in October, which will be promoted on the Apocryphon Tour throughout 2012 and 2013. The Sword are commonly categorized as a doom metal or stoner metal band, and are heavily influenced by such groups as Black Sabbath and Sleep. The group have toured with a wide range of fellow metal artists, including local band &#8230;And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead and stoner group Year Long Disaster, and have also been chosen to support Metallica on a number of recent tours. Their first album Age of Winters failed to chart, but their subsequent releases have all gained increasing commercial success, with Apocryphon charting in the top 20 of the Billboard 200 chart. ", "Dashboard Confessional": "Dashboard Confessional was an emo group started in 2000, by Chris Carrabba in Boca Raton, Florida, as a side project from his band Further Seems Forever. Chris recorded his first album, The Swiss Army Romance, in 2000. The following year, he recorded Further Seems Forever&#x27;s debut album The Moon Is Down. However, he left the band soon after the album&#x27;s release, instead recording and releasing his sophomore album The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most, as well as a follow-up EP titled So Impossible. By 2002, three other musicians had joined the band, including former Further Seems Forever band mate Jerry Castellanos and started the process of recording the band&#x27;s next album. After the success of his second album, Carrabba was asked to perform on MTV Unplugged, and the subsequent release marked the first time many of the songs were recorded with a full band. Also in 2002, the music video for &quot;Screaming Infidelities&quot; won the coveted MTV2 award at the MTV Video Music Awards, beating out Norah Jones, The Strokes, The Hives, Nappy Roots and Musiq. This video starred Chris in both the performance and the storyline. The video was directed by Maureen Egan and Matthew Barry. In 2003, the band released its third album A Mark, A Mission, A Brand, A Scar. Peaking at #2 on the United States Billboard charts, the album proved to be the band&#x27;s most commercially-viable album yet. In the summer of 2004, Dashboard Confessional recorded the song &quot;Vindicated&quot; for the film Spider-Man 2. The song was featured on the soundtrack and played over the film&#x27;s end credits. Because of this, the band gained a sizable audience for their next release the following summer. In May of 2005, Dashboard Confessional entered the studio to record their fourth album with acclaimed producer, Daniel Lanois. The album was released on June 27, 2006; its first single was &quot;Don&#x27;t Wait&quot;. Following the release of Dusk and Summer, Dashboard Confessional went on a summer tour of the U.

During an interview with Billboard posted on September 11, 2007, Carrabba stated that he is 14 tracks into what would be the band&#x27;s sixth studio album. He is also unsure about when it would be recorded, but plans to have 30 tracks to draw from. It may be a concept album: &quot;only with the last three has it become, like, &#x27;All right, these have a continuity and there&#x27;s something going on,&#x27; so I&#x27;m excited to see where that leads&quot;. The album, titled &#x27;Alter The Ending&#x27;, was released November 10 2009 (US). A two disc version of the album is available.

", "Soda Stereo": "Soda Stereo was a rock power trio formed in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1982. Consisting of guitarist and vocalist Gustavo Cerati, bassist Zeta Bosio and drummer Charly Alberti, the band established what would become the template for many other popular Spanish-speaking pop and rock music groups: Clever, often mysterious lyrics, pleasing musical arrangements and an elaborate and glamorous aesthetic image. Though nominally thought of as a new wave or alternative rock group, they also experimented with several different styles throughout their career, including ska, post-punk, power pop, shoegazing, neo-psychedelia, dream pop and electronic rock. The band&#x27;s sound was heavily influenced by British and American new wave and post-punk groups, including The Police, XTC, Talking Heads and Squeeze. In 1997, after a farewell tour through various countries and finally Argentina, the band disbanded. Personal and creative differences brought them to this decision. On September 20, 1997, Soda Stereo played their last show, in front of 75,000 people at the Estadio Monumental (or River Plate Stadium) in Buenos Aires. A final comeback tour in late 2007, the &quot;Me Veras Volver&quot; tour was scheduled and the band performed live for large audiences breaking sell out records throughout Latin America and the US. With the release of albums such as &quot;Signos&quot;, &quot;Doble Vida&quot;, &quot;Cancion Animal&quot; and &quot;Dynamo&quot;, Soda Stereo became one of the most critically acclaimed Argentinean rock bands, being the first one to tour through all of Latin America, and achieving a degree of success that no other local rock band had accomplished before. Bio : In 1982, Cerati, Bosio and Alberti recorded some demos and started to play regularly in a Buenos Aires bar called &quot;Zero&quot;. After performing several shows, a CBS producer decided to give the band a chance. In 1984, their eponymous debut album, Soda Stereo was released. Produced by Federico Moura, lead singer of the band Virus, it proved successful. In October, 1984 the band played at the Buenos Aires Rock &amp; Pop Festival with INXS, Nina Hagen and Charly Garcia. Their second album, Nada Personal was released in 1985 and re-affirmed the popularity of the band. Instant classics such as &quot;Nada Personal&quot; and &quot;Cuando Pase el Temblor&quot; made the album a big seller and increased the band&#x27;s notoriety. The video for the single &quot;Cuando Pase el Temblor&quot; was nominated in the category &quot;Finalist Video&quot; on the 12th Edition of the Video and TV World Festival. Released in 1986, their third LP Signos represented the international breakthrough from Argentina to the rest of Latin America: This was the first Argentinean rock album to be released on compact disc, -however the CD was first released in 1988. &quot;Signos&quot; contained songs as &quot;Persiana Americana&quot;, the self-tiled &quot;Signos&quot; and &quot;Profugos&quot;. The album was number one in several countries and gave the band the chance to conquer much wider audiences. Sodamania, resembling Beatlemania, was now widespread. Soda Stereo embarked in an extensive tour through Latin America to promote the album: They gave an unprecedented 22 concerts in 17 different cities. A live album called Ruido Blanco was recorded and contained most of the songs played on the &quot;Signos&quot; Tour. After over a year without recording new material, the band travelled to New York City to start work on Doble Vida which was released in 1988. The album, produced by David Bowie&#x27;s guitarist Carlos Alomar, was recorded and mixed in a state of the arts console and was Soda&#x27;s most ambitious project so far. The first three songs of the album were released as singles, &quot;Picnic en el 4oB&quot;, &quot;En la Ciudad de la Furia&quot; and &quot;Lo que Sangra (La Cupula)&quot; which became massive hits. The EP Languis followed. Released the next year, it contaided mixes from Doble Vida and one new song, &quot;Mundo de Quimeras&quot;. It was their seventh album, Cancion Animal, to be released in 1990 the one that represented the band&#x27;s creative and commercial peak. The songs are amongst the band&#x27;s strongest and most popular. It was recorded in Miami and Buenos Aires. &quot;Cancion Animal&quot; contained the instant classic &quot;de Musica Ligera&quot;, the single &quot;Un Millon de Anos Luz&quot;, the intimate short piece &quot;Te Para Tres&quot; and the anthemic tracks &quot;(En) El Septimo Dia&quot; and &quot;Hombre Al Agua&quot;. Overall, the album is considered the most consistent work by the band, along with &quot;Signos&quot;. On December 14, 1991 they performed the majority of the album on the 9 de Julio Avenue in Buenos Aires at a free concert. An unprecedented 250,000 people were in attendance. This success brought them to perform 14 continuous sold-out shows at Buenos Aires&#x27;s Gran Rex Theater. From these shows emerged the Live/Mixes EP Rex Mix. In late 1992 Soda Stereo released Dynamo. This album although now regarded as a highlight in the history of Argentinean rock, was initially Soda&#x27;s most underrated, and with the passing of time has achieved significant recognition. Its most ambitious and experimental work so far, Dynamo was recorded in Buenos Aires. The album delved in electronic, shoegazy and dance-ethereal sophisticated compositions. The band presented the highly experimental record in its entirety in a local talk-show, &quot;Fax&quot;. This was the first stereophonic TV transmission in Argentina. The band toured Europe and did TV Shows and concerts in Spain and later again in South America. Shortly after the tour, bassist Zeta Bosio suffered the loss of his son in a car accident. This unfortunate incident forced the band to stop touring and promoting the album and sent the trio into a hiatus, during which singer Gustavo Cerati started his solo career and released his debut solo album Amor Amarillo. The band&#x27;s last studio album, Sueno Stereo was recorded in London and Buenos Aires and was released in 1995. Three singles became significant hits: &quot;Ella Uso mi Cabeza como un Revolver&quot;, &quot;Paseando por Roma&quot; and &quot;Zoom&quot;. &quot;Sueno Stereo&quot; reached platinum disc only 15 days after its release. MTV Unplugged&#x27;s Comfort y Musica Para Volar was released in 1996, and contained not only unplugged and plugged songs, but some out-takes from Sueno Stereo as well. On May 1st, 1997, personal problems between the members and different artistic criteria led the band to announce its end and started the final tour on July 1997. Their last concert given on September 20th at the River Plate Stadium was recorded and released in two CD&#x27;s: &quot;El Ultimo Concierto - A &amp; B&quot;. Comeback During 2007, and after 10 years of the original split, rumours stated that Soda Stereo would tour South America before the end of the year. A reunion tour was finally announced on June 9, 2007 as the &quot;Me Veras Volver&quot; Tour (&quot;You&#x27;ll See Me Return&quot;, referring to lyrics on Doble Vida&#x27;s &quot;En la Ciudad de la Furia&quot;). The tour started at the River Plate stadium on October 19, 2007, where they played &quot;El Ultimo Concierto&quot; in 1997. It ended in the same venue on December 21, 2007. Initially, the band announced two concerts at River, but 90. 000 tickets were sold in only 24 hours. The band added one more show to the schedule, and after three days, the tickets for the first three shows were also sold out, so the band added two more shows in Argentina to the tour. The surprising amount of fans attending the five shows (more than 300,000) made Soda Stereo&#x27;s return one of the most watched public events in Argentina. As of 20 October 2007, 22 shows were confirmed, including one show in Santiago - Chile, Bogota - Colombia, and others in Ecuador, Venezuela, Peru and Panama. Also three shows were confirmed in the United States: One in the Home Depot Center in Los Angeles, California and two in the American Airlines Arena in Miami, Florida. Later, more shows were added in Mexico and Argentina. This made Soda Stereo the only band to have performed more than five times in Buenos Aires&#x27;s Estadio Monumental in a single tour. &quot;Gira Me Veras Volver&quot; -the supporting 2CD album, featured live performances of the songs in all the different countries of Latin America where the tour went, and the U. S. Together with the new comeback tour, a compilation album was released, entitled Me Veras Volver (Hits &amp; +). Exclusive content can be downloaded via the band&#x27;s official website using a special code featured on the CD booklet. After the end of the tour, the band members continued with their individual careers.

A progressive rock band from Warsaw, Poland, founded in 2001 by Mariusz Duda (bass guitar, vocal), Piotr Grudzinski (electric guitar) and Piotr Kozieradzki (drums), who shared a love for progressive rock and heavy metal. Up to 2003 Jacek Mielnicki was playing keyboard in the band, but some conflicts led him to leave the band, and in the same year the new keyboardist Michal Lapaj joined. Following their 2003 debut Out of Myself, the band were signed by major prog label InsideOut, releasing Second Life Syndrome in 2005. Riverside&#x27;s music has been described as a mix between, Pink Floyd, Anathema, Opeth, and Dream Theater, containing long, ethereal keyboard-laden passages and heavy, crunchy metal riffs. Rapid Eye Movement was leaked on the internet in August 2007, and was released in the end of September in Europe, October 09 in the US. In the summer of 2007 Riverside supported Dream Theater in the European leg of their tour. In 2009 they released their album Anno Domini High Definition. Mariusz Duda had the following to say about the album on January 27, 2009: &quot;We have gone from Warsaw, we have changed the studio and the producer. We care deeply about creating a coherent record and that is why most probably there are only going to be five songs on it. The material will be energetic, multifarious, and - I hope so - very good for live performances. It will be a story about liquid modernity, life in a constant hurry, stress and anxiety about the future. A picture of our times in 1920 x 1080 definition. &quot; In 2011 they released a mini album (only available at the 10th anniversary tour gigs), entitled Memories in My Head, and contains 3 new songs. In January 2013, Riverside released their fifth full-length album, Shrine of New Generation Slaves. Official site 2. A 90s alternative rock band from Pennsylvania that played jangly music along the lines of the Railway Children and the Ocean Blue, yet incorporated a dream pop sound similar to For Against. Their first album, One, was released on Sire Records in 1992, and their second album, Taste, was self-released around 1994. The Official Site of this band is http://www. riversidetaste. com . 3. A country rock band formerly known as Riverside Avenue from Missouri, USA. They were active between 1980 and 1990. They re-formed in 2001 and released the album Simple Life.

The original lineup included singer/bassist Fat Mike, drummer Erik Sandin, and guitarist Eric Melvin. Since 1991, the lineup has remained the same, with El Hefe playing guitar and trumpet. They have released 11 full-length studio albums, 15 EPs, 2 live albums, and many 7&quot; singles. The group has sold over 6 million records worldwide, making them one of the most successful independent acts of all time. The band&#x27;s sound is diverse, utilizing elements of skate punk, hardcore punk, reggae, and other music genres. Their lyrics generally satirize issues such as politics, society, various subcultures, racism, the music industry, and religion, often using a large amount of comedy. NOFX&#x27;s first recording was a demo from 1983, produced by The Germs drummer Don Bolles, which did not sell any copies. They released their self-titled debut EP on Mystic Records in 1985, which was later re-released in 1992 as part of the Maximum RocknRoll CD. For a year, Erik Sandin left the band and was replaced by Scott Sellers, then Scott Aldahl. Dave Allen was in the band for about four months, until he died in a car accident. In 1986, the band released So What if We&#x27;re on Mystic! . Dave Casillas joined the band on second guitar in 1987 and was featured on the EP The P. M. R. C. Can Suck on This! , attacking the PMRC&#x27;s call for censorship of music. The original cover was an edited S&amp;M photo, but the re-released version was changed to a photo of Eric Melvin. Eric Sandin returned and they recorded Liberal Animation in 1988 (before Dave was replaced by Steve) with Brett Gurewitz of Bad Religion. Although the title and some lyrics mocked vegetarianism and animal rights, Fat Mike says that he became a vegetarian after he wrote Liberal Animation . &#x27;If a big enough animal had a chance it would eat you up!&#x27; The album was re-released in 1991 on Gurewitz&#x27;s label Epitaph. Dave then left the band and was replaced by Steve Kidwiller. NOFX had signed to Epitaph by 1989, releasing their second album, titled S&amp;M Airlines . 1990 saw the release of Ribbed . By 1991, Aaron Abeyta (aka El Hefe), joined to round out the group. White Trash, Two Heebs and a Bean was released in 1992, which originally had the title White Trash, Two Kikes, and a Spic . The original title was changed because Eric Melvin&#x27;s grandmother was upset about the racial epithets. It was not until the 1994 release of Punk in Drublic that the band had a commercial breakthrough, with the album going gold. In the same year, pop punk entered the mainstream with the success of The Offspring&#x27;s Smash and Green Day&#x27;s Dookie . In 1996 they released Heavy Petting Zoo , which wasn&#x27;t very popular among its fans because it showed a different sound in some tracks. Their 1997 record So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes was faster, with more ska and reggae, and was well received by the public, although its title shocked everybody because it seemed as it was going to be their last album. They soon stated it wasn&#x27;t true. In 1999, the band released The Decline , a fiery and pessimistic social commentary. Having a duration of 18 minutes and 23 seconds, it is nearly the longest punk song to date, second only to &quot;Yes Sir, I Will&quot; by Crass, which spans more than 22 minutes. The coming of a new century marked the end of NOFX in Epitaph Records. In 2000 they released Pump Up the Valuum , which in many people&#x27;s opinion is a good record but still is missing something. In 2003, NOFX released War on Errorism , and launched their anti-George W. Bush campaign. Fat Mike organized the website Punkvoter. com, compiled two chart-topping Rock Against Bush compilations, and kicked off a Rock Against Bush United States tour. The band has released many EPs (i. e. Fuck the Kids , The Longest Line ) on Fat Mike&#x27;s own label Fat Wreck Chords. In February 2005, they launched the NOFX 7&quot; of the Month Club, a subscription-based service which saw the release of one new EP almost monthly, from February 2005 to March 2006 (a total of 12 releases). The cover art for these EPs were chosen from fan-submitted entries. The first 3000 subscribers to the club received all of their records on colored vinyl. Fat Wreck Chords later released full sets of the EPs. On March 14, 2006, an EP entitled Never Trust a Hippy was released. The EP was followed on April 18 by the album Wolves in Wolves&#x27; Clothing . On September 12, 2006, the video game EA Sports NHL07 was released, featuring the title track of the latter album on its soundtrack. The band recorded three nights of shows in San Francisco, California for the live album, They&#x27;ve Actually Gotten Worse Live! that was released on November 20, 2007. NOFX aired in 2008 a reality show on Fuse TV called NOFX: Backstage Passport , chronicling their recent worldwide tour full of mishaps and fun stuff. NOFX released their eleventh full length, Coaster , on April 28, 2009. NOFX will release their twelfth full length, Self/Entitled, on September 11th, 2012. Official site: http://nofxofficialwebsite. com", "Halestorm": "Halestorm is a rock band from Pennsylvania (US) that signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records, a major recording label, on June 28, 2005. The group has been consistently active, writing and performing original music since the mid-1990&#x27;s and becoming increasingly successful. They have achieved international airplay, having been featured on the Lord Litter show in Germany. The band has been the featured artist, appearing on the cover of Pennsylvania Musician magazine three times (August 1999, March 2000, and February 2003). The band toured nationally across the United States from January to March 2006 on the Winterfresh Sno-Core Tour with Seether, Shinedown, and Flyleaf. There were about 23 shows in that tour, and the band has performed about 200 times per year since 1997. Siblings Arejay and Elizabeth &quot;Lzzy&quot; Hale have been actively writing and performing original music since 1997 when they were 10 and 13 years old, respectively. Both brother and sister started learning piano at the age of 5; Lzzy later progressed to a keytar and Arejay to the drums. Lzzy took guitar lessons at 16. The teen siblings released an EP titled Don&#x27;t Mess With the Time Man in 2000. In Halestorm&#x27;s earliest incarnation, Lzzy and Arejay&#x27;s father played bass before Josh Smith joined the group in 2004. Guitarist Joe Hottinger joined in 2003. The group signed a recording contract with Atlantic Records on June 28, 2005 and released a live EP titled One and Done. The EP, now out of print, featured an early live version of &quot;It&#x27;s Not You. &quot; Their self-titled debut album was released on April 28, 2009. The song &quot;I Get Off&quot; served as the album&#x27;s lead single and has gained heavy radio play. Both the song and video for their second single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not You&quot;, were released in late November 2009. In early 2010, the band released a promotional music video for their song &quot;Love/Hate Heartbreak&quot;. &quot;Familiar Taste of Poison&quot;, was released in 2010. The official music video was released on August 10, 2010. Lzzy Hale&#x27;s use of Gibson guitars is well known; models she plays includes the Tribal Flying V, Gibson Explorer, Les Paul Custom, Firebird and the Joan Jett Signature Melody Maker. Arejay Hale was featured in the June 2010 issue of Modern Drummer magazine, and is endorsed by Ludwig Drums, Zildjian Cymbals and Pro-Mark Drumsticks. Halestorm is well known for their near non-stop touring, often performing as many as 250 shows a year. Since 2006 they have toured with many hard rock and heavy metal acts including Chevelle, Seether, Staind, Papa Roach, Trapt, Three Days Grace, Theory of a Deadman, Buckcherry, Disturbed, Shinedown, Megadeth, and Heaven &amp; Hell. Halestorm appeared on the first annual Rockstar Energy drink Uproar Festival with headliners Disturbed and Avenged Sevenfold; plus Stone Sour, Hellyeah, Hail the Villain, Airbourne and New Medicine. In October 2010 Halestorm will be making their first trip to Japan to participate in the 2010 Loud Park Festival. Halestorm will embark on the 2010 Taste of Chaos tour alongside headliners, Disturbed, as well as support acts, Papa Roach, and Buckcherry. On November 16, 2010 Halestorm released a live CD/DVD entitled Live in Philly 2010, which was recorded at The TLA in Philadelphia in early 2010. On March 22, 2011, Halestorm released an EP called ReAnimate containing covers of songs of different genres, including &quot;Out Ta Get Me&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses, &quot;Bad Romance&quot; by Lady Gaga, and the first single &quot;Slave to the Grind&quot; by Skid Row. On January 24, 2012, Halestorm released the EP Hello, It&#x27;s Mz. Hyde, a sneak preview of four songs from their upcoming studio album. Their second full length album, The Strange Case Of&#8230; was released on April 10, 2012 in the US, April 9 in the UK, and April 17 in Italy. In May 2012, Halestorm made history by becoming the first female-fronted band to top the active rock airplay chart with their song &quot;Love Bites&#8230;(So Do I). &quot; In the same month, Gibson Guitars created a signature series guitar for Lzzy Hale. On February 10, 2013, Halestorm won Grammy for best rock/metal performance for their song Love Bites (so do I). ", "The Orb": "The Orb (sometimes credited as simply Orb) is a British electronic music band known for pioneering the genre of ambient house. The Orb is heavily influenced by dub music, and much of their later output has been in the electronic dub category, more so than ambient house. The group was formed in 1988 by Dr. Alex Paterson (full name Duncan Robert Alex Paterson) and Jimmy Cauty (one half of The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu and later The KLF). The Orb&#x27;s first release was the acid house anthem &quot;Tripping on Sunshine&quot;. In May 1989, The Orb released the &quot;Kiss EP&quot;, which was heavily influenced by New York&#x27;s KISS FM. Paterson began DJing around London, England at this time when he met Paul Oakenfold. At Oakenfold&#x27;s behest, Paterson began DJing at Land of Oz, the chill-out room at Heaven. Paterson mixed samples of BBC nature recordings, NASA space broadcasts and everything in between into the music of ambient pioneers such as Brian Eno. Around this time, Paterson met Steve Hillage and Hillage later contributed guitar to the Orb&#x27;s &quot;Blue Room&quot; single. In return Paterson worked on Hillage&#x27;s System 7 project. In October 1989 The Orb released the 22-minute single &quot;A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules From the Centre of the Ultraworld&quot;, which contains large chunks of Minnie Riperton&#x27;s &quot;Loving You&quot;. The single managed to reach the lower end of the UK chart. Although Paterson and Cauty had been working on a debut album, the two split in April 1990. Cauty removed Paterson&#x27;s contributions to the album and released the remainder as &quot;Space&quot;. Killing Joke&#x27;s Youth, who&#x27;d recently found dancefloor success with Blue Pearl assisted with the single &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot;, but existing commitments made it impossible for him to be anything more than a part-time member. In his place, Paterson recruited Kris Weston (aka Thrash), a young studio engineer who had worked on &quot;Little Fluffy Clouds&quot; and recently left Fortran 5. In April, 1991, The Orb&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld&quot; was released in the United Kingdom to critical acclaim. The double-album obtained a top 30 placing in the UK. &quot;U. F. Orb&quot; was released in July, 1992. It featured the 39 minute 59 second &quot;Blue Room&quot; which was their third single to reach the UK charts, although the album version was only 17 minutes long. Early pressings of the album were available in three differently coloured sealed plastic packs (black (10,000) and blue (5,000) in the UK and green (1,000) in the US) containing an additional disc with the soundtrack from Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld (Patterns &amp; Textures edition), a mail order only long form video released by the Orb. During 1993 and 1994 The Orb were dismayed by Big Life&#x27;s intention to re-issue some of the Orb&#x27;s earlier material. As a result, Paterson and Thrash opted out of their contract and Paterson signed an international deal with Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Island Records. The double-album &quot;Live &#x27;93&quot; soon followed. It was a mix of recordings made in Glastonbury, Copenhagen and Tokyo. The album&#x27;s credits included, Simon Phillips, Nick Burton, Kris Weston, Fluff and of course Paterson. In June, 1994, they released their first studio album for Island, &quot;Pomme Fritz (The Orb&#x27;s Little Album)&quot;. The album reached number six on the UK, but critics hated it, even comparing Paterson to Pink Floyd&#x27;s Syd Barrett. August, 1994 saw the release of a collaboration between Robert Fripp, Paterson, Weston, and Thomas Fehlmann, hence the name FFWD or Fripp, Fehlmann, Weston and Duncan. Weston&#x27;s input was already diminishing by this time and following the release of FFWD, he finally parted company with Paterson. He was replaced by Thomas Fehlmann. &quot;Orbus Terrarum&quot; was released in March, 1995. In February, 1997, following an ambitious world tour, they released &quot;Orblivion&quot;. The retrospective &quot;U. F. Off&quot; came in October, 1998 and was initially available in a Limited Edition double CD. &quot;Cydonia&quot;, although recorded in 1999, was delayed by Island until its release in February, 2001. Several different versions of the album were leaked on the Net some time before the official release. The 2004 released album &quot;Bicycles &amp; Tricycles&quot; strongly departed from their earlier ambient sound, and incorporated strong hip-hop influenced rhythms, including rap on one of the tracks. In 2005 The Orb released a new studio album, &quot;Okie Dokie It&#x27;s The Orb On Kompakt&quot;, which focused heavily on the microhouse and pop ambient sounds that the Kompakt label is well known for. 2005 also saw the release of &quot;Orbsessions Volume 1&quot;, which was an album of rarities from throughout The Orbs&#x27; career. Sadly, Andy Hughes, long-time mixer and producer of many of The Orb&#x27;s works, passed away on June 12 2009, following a &#x27;short illness&#x27;. ", "While She Sleeps": "While She Sleeps is a British metallic hardcore band from Sheffield, England. Formed in 2006, the group consists of vocalist Lawrence Taylor, guitarists Sean Long and Mat Welsh, bassist Aaran Mackenzie and drummer Adam Savage. They are currently signed to Search and Destroy Records in the UK, The End Records in the US and Shock Records in Australia. Since releasing their debut mini-album The North Stands for Nothing in 2010, they have gained a much increased following. Their debut studio album This Is the Six was released on 13 August 2012, whilst While She Sleeps have received a lot of praise from the UK press and won the award for Best British Newcomer at the Kerrang! Awards 2012. While She Sleeps are generally recognized by professional reviewers as metallic hardcore. Personally citing hard rock and heavy metal bands such as; Thrice, Slipknot, Foo Fighters, Underoath, Refused, Comeback Kid, Gallows and Alexisonfire as musical influences. The band&#x27;s sound typically features heavily down-tuned guitars, thick bass tones, screaming vocals and fast-paced drumming - occasionally complimented by melodic guitar tones and piano interludes. When questioned about the progression between their debut mini-album and their latest album, guitarist Welsh said that they have not changed their sound drastically. Saying that; &quot;it&#x27;s super heavy but then it&#x27;s melodic too,&quot; suggesting that they have worked to their strengths while challenging themselves. ", "redeubelbes": "", "blink-182": "Blink-182 is an American rock band formed in Poway, a suburb of San Diego, California in 1992. The trio consists of bassist and vocalist Mark Hoppus, guitarist and vocalist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker. The band is considered a key group in the development of pop punk music; their combination of pop melodies with fast-paced punk rock featured a more radio-friendly accessibility than prior bands. The group, with original drummer Scott Raynor, emerged from the Southern California punk scene of the early 1990s and first gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent lyrical toilet humor. DeLonge left the group in 2005, sending the band into what was termed an &quot;indefinite hiatus. &quot; Following the dissolution of the band, Hoppus formed +44 together with Barker, while DeLonge put together his own outfit, Angels &amp; Airwaves. Following the death of long-time producer and friend Jerry Finn, and Barker&#x27;s near fatal plane crash, the trio reunited in 2009 and their sixth studio album, Neighborhoods, was released in 2011. Early years (1992-1998) In May 1993, Blink recorded their first demo tape, entitled &quot;Flyswatter&quot;, in drummer Scott Raynor&#x27;s bedroom. A 4-track was used to record the material. According to Hoppus, only around fifty copies of the demo were produced to give to their family and friends. Before the end of the year, the band released another two demos, one commonly known as Demo #2 while the other was entitled Buddha. Of this last record around 1,000 copies were produced by Filter Records, an independent record company headed by Hoppus&#x27;s boss. In early 1994, Blink signed with Cargo Records. The band recorded their debut full-length album, &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot; in three days. The album contained a number of updated versions of songs such as &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Strings&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;TV&quot; that had appeared on the &quot;Buddha Promo Tape&quot; as well as some originals. Shortly after the release of &quot;Cheshire Cat&quot;, Blink was threatened with legal action by a pop band in Ireland of the same name. In order to avoid a dispute, Blink appended &quot;182&quot; to the end of their name. The band has cited a variety of reasons for ultimately choosing 182, with some of the more common explanations being the number of times Tony Montana utters the word &quot;fuck&quot; in Scarface, references to the 1985 Timothy Hutton film, Turk 182!, the band&#x27;s ideal weight, the number of half the days in a year and the number of miles Hoppus had to drive to visit his girlfriend. However, DeLonge has stated that it is just a number that they &quot;pulled out of their ass&quot;. After moving to Encinitas, California, the band recorded the album &quot;Dude Ranch&quot; in 1996 with producer Mark Trombino. blink-182 recorded the album under Cargo Records, but signed with MCA which later became Geffen Records in 1996, in order to handle increased distribution. The album was released in 1997 and was relatively commercially successful, selling 4 million copies worldwide. The single &quot;Dammit&quot; did well on U. S. modern rock charts, however drummer Scott Raynor later left the band. There are two common explanations for his removal - that Raynor had a serious drinking problem and was asked to go into rehab or face ejection, or alternately, that he departed in order to attend college. Raynor claims he agreed to go to rehab, but that DeLonge and Hoppus were doubtful of his sincerity and subsequently fired him over the phone. Hoppus and DeLonge had asked drummer Travis Barker of blink-182&#x27;s support band The Aquabats to fill in for Raynor for the remainder of the tour, thus he had to learn all of the songs in a matter of hours before the show. He ultimately went on to join the band permanently afterwards, leaving The Aquabats. In 1999, blink-182 hired Jerry Finn as its producer and recorded &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. This album propelled the band into the mainstream with hit singles &quot;What&#x27;s My Age Again?&quot;, &quot;All the Small Things&quot; and &quot;Adam&#x27;s Song&quot;. All gained a significant amount of airtime on radio and MTV. Enema of the State went on to sell over 10 million copies worldwide making it the band&#x27;s best-selling album to that point. In 1999 the band also had small parts in the film American Pie, though Travis Barker was incorrectly credited as Scott Raynor. In 2000, the band released The Urethra Chronicles, a DVD which featured behind-the-scenes information. &quot;The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show: The Enema Strikes Back&quot;, blink-182&#x27;s live album, was also released in 2000, featuring songs from their three full-length records. The album also included one new studio song, &quot;Man Overboard,&quot; among the live renditions. The album quickly went out of print making it a much sought after item. A limited edition was printed in October 2006. The band continued its commercial success with &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; in 2001, which was in the same vein as &quot;Enema of the State&quot;. However, a European tour in winter 2001 was canceled in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Rescheduled dates in early 2002 were also canceled due to DeLonge&#x27;s problems with his back. In 2002, blink-182 co-headlined the Pop Disaster Tour with Green Day, along with supporting acts Jimmy Eat World and a little known band called Kut U Up. The tour was documented, from Kut U Up&#x27;s point of view, on the DVD Riding In Vans With Boys. After taking some time off in 2002, recording of the next record began in early 2003. The band released its next studio album on November 18, 2003. It featured the hit singles &quot;Feeling This&quot;, &quot;I Miss You&quot;, &quot;Down&quot;, and &quot;Always&quot;. According to Barker, the &quot;Untitled&quot; record was supposed to represent a new blink-182. It received significant airplay on radio and TV. The Cure front man Robert Smith, often cited as a major influence on the band, appeared on &quot;All of This&quot;. During late 2003, the band embarked on the &quot;Dolla Bill&quot; tour, named for the inexpensive ticket costs (It was originally planned to be completely free but later realised that it would be necessary to charge something for the ticket). A tour with No Doubt in the summer of 2004 was also very successful. Indefinite hiatus and new bands/spinoffs (2005-2009) In mid-February 2005 the band inexplicably cancelled a performance at Music for Relief&#x27;s Concert for South Asia (a show put on to aid victims of the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake). Shortly there after, before a planned final US spring tour, on February 22, 2005, the band announced they were going on an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot;. Geffen Records released a Greatest Hits compilation on November 1, 2005 in the U. S. , one previously unreleased track was included &quot;Another Girl Another Planet&quot; (a cover song originally by The Only Ones). The song was also used as the theme song to Barker&#x27;s new reality TV show, Meet the Barkers. Included was the previously issued &quot;I Miss You&quot; B-side and blink-182 album bonus track &quot;Not Now&quot;. The album reached number 6 on the Billboard 200 in the United States. DeLonge announced his new band, Angels &amp; Airwaves. As his reason for why blink-182 went on indefinite hiatus, DeLonge suggested the mounting tension between himself and Hoppus, ultimately caused by DeLonge&#x27;s desire for a break with his family coupled with Hoppus&#x27; feelings of betrayal after the formation of Box Car Racer. He also announced his plans to create a film about the final days of blink-182. Angels &amp; Airwaves released their debut album &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need to Whisper&quot; on May 23rd, 2006, where it debuted at number 4 on the Billboard 200. Hoppus and Barker&#x27;s new project +44 surfaced on December 13, 2005 with the song, &quot;No It Isn&#x27;t&quot;. Coincidentally, the song was released on +44&#x27;s official MySpace on the same day that Angels &amp; Airwaves were slated to release their first song (and also Tom DeLonge&#x27;s 30th birthday), though the release of the latter was delayed. Initially, Hoppus was hesitant to admit any deliberate correlation between the song and breakup, but has since admitted the song was about DeLonge and the breakup of the band. +44 released their first album &quot;When Your Heart Stops Beating&quot; on November 14, 2006 and debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200. In August 2006, Hoppus gave an extensive interview with B182. com . The interview focused on blink-182 and the unexplained events that had led to the band&#x27;s hiatus. Contrary to DeLonge&#x27;s statements, Hoppus said that the band had been getting along at the time of their final album. Hoppus went on to say that DeLonge requested a half-year respite from touring to spend time with his family, despite a planned final spring U. S. tour. Hoppus and Barker hesitantly conceded, leading to the cancellation of the upcoming tour. Further problems arose in discussions regarding the band&#x27;s future recording endeavors. It was at this point that Hoppus felt that blink-182 had ceased functioning as a band. Hoppus went on to state that he and Barker eventually formed +44 at the end of the European leg out of frustration for DeLonge&#x27;s constant reluctance. On April 5, 2007, it was confirmed that blink-182, along with Rancid and Green Day are some of the bands set to feature in a documentary about modern punk music. The film is titled One Nine Nine Four and looks at the genre of music in the nineties. It will consist of band interviews and archive footage, which will be all compiled together by the documentary makers Robot Academy Films in Australia. It&#x27;s expected to be released early next year. Skateboarding legend Tony Hawk will narrate the film, which also features the likes of NOFX and The Offspring. Travis Barker of +44 currently was asked if the band would get back together. He said &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I haven&#x27;t talked to Tom in a long time. I do however talk to Mark everyday. &quot; On November 18th, 2008, after Travis Barker was in a small plane crash, Mark Hoppus updated his blog, himynameismark , with this statement: &quot;in the midst of everything else that has happened lately, tom, Travis, and i have all spoken together. first through a number of phone calls, and then a couple of weeks ago we all hung out for a few hours. they've all been great, very positive conversations. we're just reconnecting as friends after four years of not talking. it's a good thing. &quot; He also stated that this doesn&#x27;t mean a blink-182 reunion, but after several years they have finally begun speaking to each other again. Hoppus also talked about Travis Barker&#x27;s brush with death in a plane crash in September 2008 and the death of their great friend and longtime producer Jerry Finn. Blink-182 officially announced their reunion while presenting at the 2009 Grammy Awards. The band&#x27;s Official Website confirmed the band&#x27;s reunion with a statement on their website. This song, the first new material released by blink-182 following their indefinite hiatus, was posted in full to Blink182. com late on July 14, 2011, then officially premiered the following day at 10:30 a. m. on Los Angeles radio station KROQ.

The group is the current project of musician Alan Palomo, also known for his work with the band Ghosthustler and as the artist VEGA. The group has released two albums: &quot;Psychic Chasms&quot; (2009) and &quot;Era Extrana&quot; (2011). The band began to garner attention in 2009 after several of their songs which had been posted online were favorably reviewed by music blogs and Web sites. On October 13, 2009, the group released its debut LP Psychic Chasms. Pitchfork Media also listed two tracks from Psychic Chasms in their list of The Top 100 Tracks of 2009. Should Have Taken Acid With You was listed as the year&#x27;s 74th top track and Deadbeat Summer noticeably came in at number 13. Shortly before the release of Psychic Chasms, Palomo said he planned on releasing another album as VEGA. It was Announced that they had recorded a few tracks recently with Emma Bunton for a possible upcoming Release in 2013. It was undefined whether it would be a part of her Fourth Album or one of their Projects. Palomo is joined on stage with Ronald Gierhart (guitar, vocals), Jason Faries (drums), and Leanne Macomber (keyboard). ", "Led Zeppelin": "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band originally formed in 1968 by guitarist Jimmy Page under the name &quot;The New Yardbirds&quot;, based on Page&#x27;s previous band, The Yardbirds. The band formed when Jimmy Page (guitar) recruited Robert Plant (vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass guitar, keyboards, mandolin), and John Bonham (drums). With their heavy, guitar-driven blues-rock sound, Led Zeppelin are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal and hard rock music. However, the band&#x27;s individualistic style drew from many sources and transcends any one genre. Led Zeppelin did not release songs from their albums as singles in the UK, as they preferred to develop the concept of &quot;album-oriented rock&quot;. Thirty years after disbanding following Bonham&#x27;s death in 1980, the band continues to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success, and broad influence. The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide, including 111. 5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. They have had all of their original studio albums reach the top ten of the Billboard album chart in the US, with six reaching the number one spot. Shortly after their first tour, the group&#x27;s eponymous first album was released on 12th January 1969. Its blend of blues and rock influences with distorted amplification made it one of the pivotal records in the evolution of heavy metal music. Although several of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s earliest songs were based on or were cover versions of blues standards, others such as &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; had a unique and distinctively heavy sound. Led Zeppelin also featured delicate acoustic guitar on &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot; in which the influence of Davy Graham can be heard, and a combination of acoustic and electric approaches on the reworked folk song &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot;. The immediate success of the first album kick-started the band&#x27;s career, especially in the United States, where they would frequently tour. The second record, simply titled Led Zeppelin II , followed in similar style later that year, and was an even greater success for the group, reaching the number-one chart position in both the United States and the United Kingdom. Jimmy Page and Robert Plant were blues fanatics; their first album included the Willie Dixon song &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, and their later hit &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; was lyrically very similar to an earlier Dixon song. (The band were subsequently accused of using his lyrics without crediting Dixon, and it was not until Chess Records brought suit fifteen years later, that proper credit - and a monetary settlement - was given. ) The band also loved American rock and roll; the exuberant styles of Fats Domino and Little Richard were inspirations, and Led Zeppelin would perform rockabilly songs originally made famous by Elvis Presley and Eddie Cochran. Onstage, Led Zeppelin concerts could last more than three hours; expanded, improvised live versions of their song repertoire often incorporated tight workouts of James Brown, Stax, and Motown-influenced soul music and funk (favourites of bassist Jones and drummer Bonham). For the writing of the music on their third album, Led Zeppelin III , the band retired to Bron-yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales. This resulted in a more acoustic sound (and a song &quot;Bron-yr-Aur Stomp&quot;, misspellt as &quot;Bron-y-Aur Stomp&quot; on the album cover) strongly influenced by Celtic and folk music. Led Zeppelin III also ushered in an era of unique album jackets, this one featuring a wheel that displayed various images through cutouts in the main jacket sleeve when rotated. In November 1970 Led Zeppelin&#x27;s record label, Atlantic Records, released &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; as a single against the band&#x27;s wishes (Atlantic had earlier released an edited version of &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; which cut the 5:34 song to 3:10). It included their only B-side, &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot;. Even though the band saw their albums as indivisible, whole listening experiences - and their manager, Peter Grant, maintained an aggressive pro-album stance - nine other singles were released without their consent. The group also resisted television appearances, which would have reduced their ability to control their presentation and sound quality. Lack of Zeppelin television exposure also enforced the band&#x27;s preference that their fans hear and see them in person. Their fourth album, Led Zeppelin IV was actually untitled, but is commonly referred to as Zoso, Runes, The Fourth Album, Sticks, Man with Sticks, or Four Symbols; it featured &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;, which Jimmy Page performed on stage on a custom-built double-necked electric Gibson guitar, the top neck a twelve-stringed version. Over twenty-five years after disbanding in response to drummer John Bonham&#x27;s tragic death in 1980, Led Zeppelin continue to be held in high regard for their artistic achievements, commercial success and influence. Since they disbanded, Page, Plant, and Jones have only played together on rare occasions. Page and Plant did get back together to record No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded as part of the MTV Unplugged series in 1994, which was accompanied by a worldwide tour, and again in 1998 for the studio album Walking Into Clarksdale . John Paul Jones also has performed since the break up - at the Bonnaroo music festival in Manchester, Tennessee. He was part of a &quot;SuperJam&quot; featuring himself on bass, Ben Harper on guitar, and Ahmir &quot;?uestlove&quot; Thompson on drums. He also played as a guest during the sets of various other artists throughout the weekend. Most recently Led Zeppelin have reformed (with Jason Bonham filling in on drums) for a one-off reunion concert in memory of Atlantic Records co-founder and executive Ahmet Ertegun. After a postponement due to Jimmy Page fracturing one of his fingers, the group performed on 10th December 2007 at the O2 Arena, London. The concert was filmed for a potential DVD release. Jimmy Page has hinted that the group may start work on new material, and that a world tour may be in the works. Awards and accolades Led Zeppelin were honoured by US President Barack Obama at the 2012 Kennedy Center Honors Throughout their career, Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band&#x27;s awards are an American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one Gold album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four Silver albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time , Rolling Stone named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004. Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity work in 2005 and Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music in 2009. The band are ranked number one on VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock&#x27;s &quot;50 best live acts of all time&quot;. They were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to British Music&quot; in 1977, as well as a &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; at the 42nd Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the &quot;Best Live Act&quot; prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the &quot;greatest rock and roll band of all time&quot;. The three surviving members (Page, Plant, and Jones) were named as 2012 recipients of Kennedy Center Honors .

Created by Nick Rhodes (keyboards) and John Taylor (bass) in Birmingham, England in 1978, it later add took in Roger Taylor (drums), Andy Taylor (guitar), and Simon Le Bon (lead vocals). The band has sold more than 70 million records over their more than 25 years of existence, making them one of the best-selling groups in history. Their songs are often vivid, hook-laden pieces dance pop that have fared well on the radio, but what many remember best about Duran Duran is their iconic music videos. Though many of the videos were tongue-in-cheek, the band has never quite escaped the glamorous and decadent &#x27;jet set&#x27; image that their early videos projected. Their flashy outfits and strident, art rock influenced music showed an immense debt to 70s English glam artists such as David Bowie and Roxy Music, yet the band grasped a sense of their own identity and became one of the keystones of the new romantic movement. Their first singer and one of their original founding members was Stephen Duffy, and their original bassist was Simon Colley. Several drummers and guitarists were subsequently tried, as well as a handful of vocalists, after Duffy left Duran Duran early in 1979. The band felt that they had something special with vocalist Simon Le Bon, and the group smashed into the pop scene shortly afterwards when &quot;Planet Earth&quot;, their debut single, was released on 2 February 1981. &quot;Planet Earth&quot; became an immediate hit in the band&#x27;s native U. K. , reaching #12 on the U. K. Singles Chart on 21 February, and it did even better in Australia, hitting #8 there. Being Duran Duran&#x27;s first Top 10 hit anywhere in the world, the song showed the group&#x27;s interest in international stardom. The band&#x27;s eponymous debut album came out promptly afterwards in June 1981. &#x27; Duran Duran &#x27; hit #3 on the album charts and remained in the U. K. Top 100 for 117 weeks, achieving platinum status by December 1982. The initial United States release failed to generate much interest at first, but the group was a British sensation due to their strident mix of pop rock and electronic music. Music videos for hit singles &quot;Planet Earth&quot; and &quot;Careless Memories&quot; were filmed in December 1980. As they also experienced considerable success with &quot;Girls on Film&quot;, which hit #5 on the UK Singles Chart and #11 on the Australian Singles Chart, the group firmly grasped the opportunity to make a name for themselves in musical television. As their fame grew, some fans worried that Duran Duran could have peaked too early. They headed into AIR Studios in London in early 1982 anxious to somehow top themselves. Band member John Taylor came up with the new album&#x27;s title, &#x27; Rio &#x27;, as a product of his fascination with the flaunting sexuality and diverse atmosphere of Brazil. He later said, &quot;Rio, to me, was shorthand for the truly foreign, the exotic, a cornucopia of earthly delights, a party that would never stop. &quot; The band had their own plans and ambitions for promotion and reunited with director Russell Mulcahy (who was behind the video for &quot;Planet Earth&quot;) to plan out the release of a full length &#x27;video album&#x27;-- eleven videos in total. Totally dedicated to on-site filming, guitarist Andy Taylor even contracted a tropical virus and ended up hospitalized, thankfully getting better relatively quickly. &#x27; Rio &#x27; was, simply, a commercial juggernaut. The band&#x27;s second studio album, originally released worldwide on 10 May 1982, reached #2 in the UK and #1 in Australia. Massively popular in the U. S. , it earned a gold disc on 1 March 1983 and went platinum on 26 April 1983, eventually reaching double-platinum status. As songs such as &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; received considerable airplay, critical acclaim also grew for the release. With MTV heavily playing the band&#x27;s music videos, the album is still held as one of the best new wave albums ever. In April 2013, &#x27; Rio &#x27; was even voted #3 in BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &#x27;Top 100 Favourite Albums of all time&#x27; list. In 1985, Duran Duran performed &quot;A View To A Kill&quot; for the the James Bond film of the same name. The song appeared in the movie&#x27;s title sequence and was also a best-selling single in its own right. In 1987, &quot;Out Of My Mind&quot; was featured at the end credits of the drama film &#x27;The Saint&#x27; as well. Like Depeche Mode, Duran Duran was among the earliest bands to work on their own remixes. From the very beginning, the band had a keen sense of style, and worked with stylist Perry Haines and fashion designers such as Kahn &amp; Bell and Antony Price to build a sharp and elegant image, soon growing beyond the ruffles and sashes of the pirate-flavoured New Romantic look. Although the group never disbanded, it went through several line-up changes over the years - American guitarist Warren Cuccurullo (formerly of Missing Persons) was also a member of the band from 1989 to 2001, and drummer Sterling Campbell was a member from 1989 to 1991. John Taylor, Roger Taylor and Andy Taylor all returned in 2001 and created a stir among music media and the band&#x27;s fans. Duran Duran released the first album from the reunited line-up, Astronaut , in 2004, which was in turn followed up by many sold out shows in England, most notably Wembley Arena, where a live DVD of the tour was filmed in 2004/2005. In October of 2006, it was announced on Duran Duran&#x27;s website that Andy Taylor had left the band. The band&#x27;s latest album, &#x27; Red Carpet Massacre &#x27; was released in November 2007. They performed the album live in New York City on Broadway at the Barrymore Theater, for what was originally scheduled as an unprecedented 10-night run. A stage hand union strike shortened the run by a few nights, but Duran Duran were able to re-schedule the shows elsewhere. They went on to tour the world, ending their successful run in December of 2008. 2008 also saw the release of a new DVD that documents the making of their now-classic &quot; Rio &quot; album (called &quot; Classic Albums: Rio (Collector&#x27;s Edition) &quot;), and a book called &quot;Would Someone Please Explain?&quot;- a compilation of questions from the &quot;Ask Katy&quot; area of their popular website.  Duran Duran returned at the end of 2010 with their 13th album, the digital and self-released album All You Need Is Now which debuted at number one on the iTunes charts in many countries (including the USA). The physical version of the album will be released with bonus tracks in February 2011. The album was produced by Mark Ronson.

She has received four Grammy Award nominations. Jewel is the daughter of Nedra Carroll, an artist and personal manager, and Atz Kilcher, an elementary school music teacher, folk singer and social worker. Her mother of Irish descent and her father is of Swiss-German origin. She is the cousin of actress Q&#x27;Orianka Kilcher. She spent most of her young life in Homer, Alaska, United States, living with her father. The home she grew up in did not have indoor plumbing; it had a simple outhouse instead. She and her father sometimes earned a living by singing in bars and taverns. It was from these experiences she learned to yodel, a quality demonstrated in many of her songs. Her father was a Mormon, but they stopped attending the church shortly before she turned eight. Yule Kilcher, her grandfather, was a state senator involved in drafting Alaska&#x27;s constitution for its admission into a state from a territory in 1959. During high school, Jewel was known to spell her name &quot;Jule&quot; or &quot;Juel,&quot; but she attributes this to simply playing with her name. Jewel learned to play the guitar while at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Interlochen, Michigan, United States where she majored in operatic voice. She started writing songs at the age of seventeen. For a time, she was poverty-stricken and lived in her van while traveling about the country doing street performances and small gigs. She gained some recognition by singing at the Innerchange Coffeehouse and Java Joe&#x27;s in San Diego, California, United States. Her friend Steve Poltz&#x27;s band, The Rugburns, played at the same venues. Jewel later collaborated with Poltz on some of her songs, including &quot;You Were Meant For Me&quot; (He also appeared in the second, best-known, video for this song). The Rugburns opened for Jewel on her Tiny Lights tour in 1997. Poltz appeared in Jewel&#x27;s band on the Spirit World Tour 1999 playing guitar. In 1993, Michael Balzary (better known by the stage name - Flea) of the rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers met Jewel after he saw her perform at a local cafe. He went back to her van where she was living, where she sang a few of her songs to him. He described her singing voice as being &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;breathtaking&quot;. Jewel was discovered by Inga Vainshtein in August 1993, when a musician from a local San Diego band, Rust, whom Vainshtein was managing at the time, called to tell her about a girl surfer who sang at a local coffee shop on Thursdays. Vainshtein drove to Innerchange coffee shop with a rep from Atlantic Records, and after the show they called Danny Goldberg, the head of Atlantic Records west coast operations, and asked him to pay for Jewel&#x27;s demo. Vainshtein eventually became Jewel&#x27;s manager, and was instrumental in creating a major bidding war, which led to Jewel&#x27;s deal with Atlantic Records. She cut her debut album, Pieces of You, when she was nineteen and it was released in 1995. Jewel recorded &quot;Pieces of You&quot; in a studio on Neil Young&#x27;s ranch, and was backed by his band, The Stray Gators, who played on Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Harvest&quot; and &quot;Harvest Moon&quot; albums. Part of the album was cut live at the Innerchange Coffeehouse in San Diego where she had risen to local fame. The album stayed on the Billboard 200 for an impressive two years, reaching number four at its peak. The album spawned the Top 10 hits &quot;You Were Meant for Me&quot;, &quot;Who Will Save Your Soul&quot; and &quot;Foolish Games&quot;. The album was a huge success and eventually sold over 12 million copies in the United States. alone, more than all of her subsequent albums put together. Due to her successes, she was chosen to sing the American national anthem at the opening of the Super Bowl in January 1998 in San Diego. She was introduced as &quot;San Diego&#x27;s own Jewel!&quot; However, she was criticized for lip-syncing the anthem to a pre-recording. This was especially noticeable due to her missing her cue and not mouthing the first words. In November 1998, Jewel released her second album, Spirit. The album peaked at #3 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 4 million copies in the United States. The songs &quot;Hands&quot; and &quot;Down So Long&quot; hit the Top 10. Other singles followed, a new version of &quot;Jupiter (Swallow The Moon)&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s Simple Is True&quot;, the theme song to her upcoming movie, and the charity single &quot;Life Uncommon&quot;. A year later, In November 1999, Jewel released Joy: A Holiday Collection. The album sold over a million copies and peaked at #32 on the Billboard 200. She released a cover of &quot;Joy to the World&quot; from the album. In November 2001, the album This Way was released. The album peaked at #9 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 1 million copies in the United States, standing as her most critically acclaimed album to date. Jewel hit the Top 10 with the song &quot;Standing Still&quot; and the Top 40 with the song &quot;Break Me&quot;. Other singles released were &quot;This Way&quot; and &quot;Serve The Ego&quot;, the latter giving Jewel her first number one club hit. In 2003, Jewel released the album 0304. She writes in the liner notes, &quot;I wanted to make a record that was a modern interpretation of big band music. A record that was lyric driven, like Cole Porter, that also had a lot of swing. And a lot of it is thanks to Lester, because when I told him I wanted to make a record that combined dance, urban, and folk music, he didn&#x27;t look at me like I was crazy. &quot; While some fans considered 0304 an innovative album that held to the tradition of her previous albums, others felt that it was too much of a departure from the style of her previous albums. Following the limited success of &quot;Serve the Ego&quot;, Jewel moved to a more pop-oriented sound with the release of the single &quot;Intuition&quot;. The song, which strays from her usual folk style with simple guitar instrumentation, starts off with a French accordion and experiments with pop beats using synthesizers. The song was successful, reaching #5 on the Billboard Adult Top 40. However, a number of Jewel&#x27;s fans criticized her for abandoning her traditional folk style in exchange for a new pop sound. Accusations of &quot;selling out&quot; for personal gain, among other things, were made. Despite the different sound style, the song is lyrically similar to her previous work. It has a number of references to culture, including mentioning celebrities such as pop star Jennifer Lopez, model Kate Moss, magazines, film culture and commercialism. On May 2, 2006, Jewel released her sixth album, Goodbye Alice In Wonderland. The album received mixed reviews, but still managed to debut at #8 on the Billboard Albums Chart. The album sold 82,000 copies in its first week out. The lead single &quot;Again and Again&quot; has had moderate success on Adult Top 40 Radio, peaking at #16. The second single, &quot;Good Day&quot;, was released to radio in late June but failed to gain any traction on the radio airplay charts. Later, a video for &quot;Stephenville, TX&quot;, her next single, has been seen on Yahoo! Launch. As of December 2006, the album barely sold 270,000 copies. It is notable in that it is the only Jewel album not to achieve Gold certification, even though it has been hailed as arguably one of her best albums. As one music critic, Timothy Duggan, notes: &quot;This album showcases Jewel&#x27;s unique talent as a lyricist, alongside a definite growth in her musicianship. It is what &#x27;Pieces of You&#x27; might have been had Jewel had the musical knowledge then that she has now. A very satisfying work, all in all&quot;. Rolling Stone however, called the album &quot;overdone and undercooked&quot; with a rating of 2 stars out of 5. In early February 2007, Jewel recorded a duet with Jason Michael Carroll, &quot;No Good in Goodbye (With Jewel)&quot;, that was featured on Carroll&#x27;s debut CD, &quot;Waitin&#x27; in the Country&quot;. She also made a promotional appearance on the T in Boston for the Verizon Yellow Pages, playing songs on a moving subway car and then doing an hour-long acoustic concert in South Station for a large crowd of adoring fans. In an interview with the Boston Globe, Jewel confirmed that she is no longer affiliated with a record label, confirming rumors that Atlantic Records failed to renew her contract after the lackluster sales of her then-latest album. She also hinted that she would like to do a country album next. She is working with John Rich of Big &amp; Rich fame. He says that she is &quot;probably one of the greatest American singer-songwriters we have had&quot;. He also said that &quot;every label in Nashville&quot; is talking to her now. In November 2007, Jewel was signed to Valory Records, a newly formed division of the independent Big Machine Records label. Her first country album, Perfectly Clear, is currently scheduled for release on June 3, 2008; its lead single, Stronger Woman was released to country radio on January 17, 2008, and has entered the Top 20 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts. As of the April 26, 2008 country charts, the single was #13 on the charts, which is its peak position thus far. She will tour with Brad Paisley, Chuck Wicks, and Julianne Hough on Paisley&#x27;s 2008 tour.

In 1986, after a mere 7&quot; single release - SWORD decides to re-baptise the band under the JEWEL moniker. By 'updating' the vocalist position, the quartet aimed at countless regional gigs (one of them caught on cassette tape for national circulation) prior to the release of their self-financed &quot;La Morta&quot; EP in 1988. Whoever can recall some famous Dutch band by the time will stop counting at one hand, so JEWEL had equal opportunities in eating some good slice. The band released of a 1990 live album, a set of gigs in Russia, the 1991's &quot;Revolution in Heaven&quot; CD release and the &quot;Pugnandi Causa&quot; VHS release prior to the band's split-up. 4) Japanese heavy metal band Jewel . Released one EP &quot;Jewel I&quot; and a full length by the same name in 1985 and 1986 respectively, as well as a live video VHS. Split up. For this band, please switch to JEWEL. 5) A Japanese visual kei band called Jewel formed in 2008.

The background: Girl Band are the latest in a long line of &quot;Girl&quot; bands that includes such notables as Girls, Shy Girls, September Girls and Girl Unit - and that&#x27;s not even mentioning the &quot;Women&quot; ones such as Women, Woman E and Woman&#x27;s Hour. Usually when an indie band adopts the female sex (is there an indie band called Female Sex? There ought to be) as part of their moniker there is an element of snarkiness going on, and so it is with Girl Band. They took their name after meeting &quot;an annoying girl&quot; in a bar one night. Apparently, she liked the Wombats. &quot;She was such an awful woman,&quot; said the guitarist afterwards.

Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire before moving to Framlingham, Suffolk. In his time in Suffolk, he was known to have flourished as a hidden talent when it came to music. He learned guitar at a very young age, and began writing songs during his time at Thomas Mills High School in Framlingham. By the time Sheeran had left school, he was already certain that music was going to play a major part in his life, and therefore studied at Access To Music in Norwich before moving to London which improved his chances of getting gigs. Sheeran began recording in 2005, which lead to the release of his first EP, The Orange Room EP. Sheeran also released two albums, a self titled one in 2006 and Want Some? in 2007 gaining little attention. After Sheeran moved to London and had done extensive gigging, performing songs from his EP and albums, as well as ones which he had recently written, he decided to release another EP, You Need Me in late 2009. However, it wasn&#x27;t until February 2010 that Sheeran began to get noticed after he posted a video through SB. tv displaying his diverse style. This video led to mainstream rapper Example asking Sheeran to tour with him. Throughout 2010, Sheeran began to be seen by more and more people over the internet through Youtube and his fan-base grew incredibly, with him also getting credit from The Independent newspaper, England football captain Rio Ferdinand and even Elton John. Sheeran released three EP&#x27;s in 2010, Loose Change, which features one of his most known songs, &quot;The A Team&quot;, Songs I Wrote With Amy, and Ed Sheeran: Live at the Bedford, a live EP recorded in October. During the year, Sheeran also went to the US, where he was discovered by international superstar Jamie Foxx, who asked Sheeran to perform on his radio show, which gained him some fans in the US. By the end of the year, Sheeran was seen to be one of the best unsigned artists in the country. On 9 January 2011, Sheeran released his final independent EP, No. 5 Collaborations Project featuring appearances by grime artists including Wiley, JME, Devlin and Ghetts. With this EP, Sheeran gained mainstream attention for reaching number 2 in the iTunes chart, without any promotion or label. He was listed as a &#x27;special guest&#x27; on Devlin&#x27;s 2011 &#x27;Bud, Sweat and Beers&#x27; mini tour alongside Griminal and Tinchy Stryder.

She is the best-selling female rock artist of all time. Her international debut album Jagged Little Pill (1995) became one of the most successful albums of all time with total worldwide sales estimated at thirty million copies. Six more studio albums followed - Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (1998), Under Rug Swept (2002), Feast On Scraps (2002), So-Called Chaos (2004), Flavors Of Entanglement (2008) and Havoc and Bright Lights (2012) . Early Life Alanis Morissette was born in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, to school teachers Alan and Georgia Morissette. Her father is French Canadian and her mother is Hungarian. She has an older brother, Chad, and a twin brother named Wade. Between the ages of three and six they lived with their parents in Lahr (Black Forest), Germany. Morissette showed a love for singing and songwriting at an early age. When she was 9 years old, Morissette wrote her first song. With the money saved from her stint on the children&#x27;s television show You Can&#x27;t Do That On Television, Morissette released an indie single Fate Stay With Me with the B-side Find The Right Man. In New York City, Morissette landed a spot on Star Search, a popular televised American talent competition with her stage name of Alanis Nadinia. Morissette flew to Los Angeles to appear on the show, but lost after one round. Alanis and Now Is the Time In 1990, Morissette signed with MCA Records Canada and released her full-length debut album, Alanis in 1991 with producer Leslie Howe. At the time, Morissette dropped Nadine from her name and was credited simply as &quot;Alanis&quot;. The dance-pop album, which was only released in Canada, went double platinum and its first single, &quot;Too Hot&quot;, reached the Top 10 on the Canadian charts. Subsequent singles included &quot;Feel Your Love&quot;, &quot;Walk Away&quot; and &quot;Plastic&quot;. In 1992, Morissette was nominated for three Juno Awards: Single of the Year, Best Dance Record, and Most Promising Female Vocalist, the last of which she won. In the same year, she released Now Is the Time, her follow-up to Alanis. The album attempted to move Morissette away from her debut album&#x27;s dance-pop sound and its lead single was An Emotion Away, with No Apologies, Real World and (Change Is) Never A Waste Of Time being the other three. However, Now Is the Time sold less than half the number of copies of her debut album, and, with her two album deal with MCA Canada complete, Morissette was without a major label recording contract. Move to Los Angeles In 1993, Morissette moved from her home town of Ottawa to Toronto. Living alone for the first time in her life, Morissette met with a bevy of songwriters, but the results frustrated her. A visit to Nashville a few months later also proved fruitless. Morissette began making trips to Los Angeles and working with as many musicians as possible, in the hopes of meeting a collaborator. During this time, Morissette met with producer and songwriter Glen Ballard. According to Ballard, the connection was &quot;instant&quot; and within 30 minutes of meeting each other, they had begun experimenting with different sounds in Ballard&#x27;s home studio. Despite Morissette&#x27;s naivety, Ballard believed he was dealing with a woman wise beyond her years. Ballard and Morissette penned their first song together called The Bottom Line. The turning point in their sessions was the song Perfect, which was written and recorded in twenty minutes. Morissette improvised the lyrics on the spot to Ballard&#x27;s delicate guitar strums. The version of the song that appeared on Jagged Little Pill was the only take the pair had ever recorded. Ballard and Morissette recorded the songs on Jagged Little Pill literally as they were being written. According to Morissette, Ballard was the first collaborator who had encouraged her to express her emotions completely and fully without any fear of shame or embarrassment. As a result, Morissette unabashedly shared everything, from her buoyant love of life in You Learn, to her warm infatuations in Head Over Feet, to her darkest, most ruthless revenge fantasies in You Oughta Know. Morissette drew inspiration for her lyrics completely from personal experiences. By the spring of 1995, Morissette penned a deal with Maverick Records. Jagged Little Pill era (1995-1998) In 1995, at the age of twenty-one, Morissette released her first international album, Jagged Little Pill. Since expectations for the album were low, Morissette&#x27;s manager and long-time friend Scott Welsh would later admit that he did not expect the album to sell any more than around 250,000 copies. The album debuted at number 118 on the Billboard 200 chart. However, things changed quickly when a Los Angeles DJ from an influential radio station stumbled onto You Oughta Know and began playing it non-stop. The song instantly garnered attention and a subsequent video went into heavy rotation on MTV. Listeners were shocked, unnerved, and delighted by the song&#x27;s use of profanity, rare for a female artist at the time. The subject of the song, an ex-boyfriend, became the most guessed about protagonist since &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain. &quot; While &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; was a hit, it was the bevy of hit singles that followed that sent Jagged Little Pill to its meteoric rise to the top. Following Hand in My Pocket, the third single, Ironic, went on to become Morissette&#x27;s biggest hit. She received heavy criticism for the lyrics, however, when it became apparent that many of the situations described by Morissette did not actually qualify as being &#x27;ironic&#x27;. Indeed, the Irish comedian Ed Byrne based a significant part of his stand-up act on pointing out the lack of irony in the song. &quot;You Learn&quot; and &quot;Head Over Feet&quot;, the fourth and fifth singles, respectively, kept Jagged Little Pill on the Billboard Top 20 charts for over a year. Jagged Little Pill was a phenomenal success. It went on to sell 16 million copies in the United States alone, over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the most successful records of all time. Indeed in Ireland just as Under Rug Swept was released in 2002, Jagged Little Pill (6 years after its release) re-entered the album charts on 21 February 2002 at #72 and reached a peak of #19 on 7 March . It took 9 weeks before it departed the charts again on 2 May of that year. Morissette was dismissed by some as a record industry puppet. She was attacked for collaborating with producer and supposed image-maker Glen Ballard, though Morissette was responsible for all of Pill&#x27;s lyrics and much of the album&#x27;s music, and though such a collaboration was not uncommon for many solo artists at the time. Her early albums in Canada also proved a hinderance for her respectability, particularly in her native country. Despite this setback, the album was nominated for six Grammy Awards. At the 1996 ceremony, Morissette performed a moving rendition of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, one that all but drained the anger from the song, leaving only an air of sorrow and remorse. That night, Morissette won awards for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, Best Rock Song and Best Rock Album, and the big one, Best Album. Later that year, Morissette embarked on an eighteen-month world tour in support of Jagged Little Pill, beginning in small clubs and ending in large venues. The DVD Jagged Little Pill, Live chronicled the bulk of this tour. Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie era (1998-2002) In 1998, Morissette recorded Uninvited, a song from the soundtrack to the film City of Angels. The track was never officially released as a single (only as a promo one), but nevertheless received widespread radio airplay. Later that year, Morissette released Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie, once again collaborating with Glen Ballard. Fans and critics alike were unprepared for Morissette&#x27;s new songwriting approach, as most of the songs on the disc, including The Couch and Unsent, challenged traditional song formulas. Nowdays, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie is considered the biggest highlight of Alanis in terms of fans&#x27; opinions. Upon release, the album started selling extremely well. Privately, the label hoped for a million copies upon initial release. It sold about half of that. Nevertheless, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, breaking the record for the most albums sold in a single week by a female artist, with sales at 469,000 copies (eventually eclipsed by Britney Spears&#x27;s Oops!&#8230; I Did It Again album). As a follow-up to Jagged Little Pill, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie had very little staying power. Its wordy, personal lyrics turned many fans off and after only 28 weeks, it left the Billboard 200, selling 2. 5 million, a huge drop from Jagged. Worldwide, the album sold about 7 million copies. However, it received positive reviews, including a four-star review from Rolling Stone magazine. In 1999, the song &quot;Uninvited&quot; won two Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. The first single, &quot;Thank U&quot;, was also nominated for a Grammy for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. The video for this song, which featured Morissette in the nude, generated mild controversy. That same year, Morissette released the live acoustic album MTV Unplugged. In 1999, Alanis Morissette briefly returned to acting, appearing as God in the Kevin Smith film Dogma. Smith, who claimed to be a big fan of Morissette&#x27;s, asked her to be in the film several times. She had to turn down the female lead and by the time her schedule allowed her to participate in the film, only the role of God, which involves virtually no speech and only an appearance at the very end of the film, was left. She also wrote and produced a song for the movie&#x27;s soundtrack, that song being Still. She also appeared on the hit HBO comedies Sex and the City and Curb Your Enthusiasm and starred in the play The Vagina Monologues. Under Rug Swept era (2002-2004) Alanis Morissette on stage at the Brazil Music Festival, 2003In 2002, after a four year absence, Alanis Morissette released her third international studio album Under Rug Swept, with the notable absence of Jagged Little Pill and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie collaborator Glen Ballard. For the first time, Morissette took on the role of sole writer and producer. The album spawned the hit single Hands Clean, while the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 215,000 in the first week. Under Rug Swept would eventually sell close to a million copies in the United States alone, though only &quot;Hands Clean&quot; received any substantial radio airplay. The album was overlooked by the Grammy Awards, but Morissette won yet another Juno Award for Producer of the Year. In December 2002, Morissette released a CD/DVD combination package, Feast on Scraps, which included live concert footage and eight previously unreleased songs from the Under Rug Swept recording sessions. The album was nominated for a Juno Music DVD of the Year award. In November 2003, Morissette appeared in the off-Broadway play The Exonerated as Sunny Jacobs, a death row inmate freed after proof surfaced that she hadn&#x27;t committed the crime, a role that she would revisit three years later, in Spring of 2006. So-Called Chaos era (2004) May 2004 saw the release of Morissette's 4th international studio album, So-Called Chaos. While all song writing on the album was credited to Morissette, the album was co-produced with Tim Thorney and John Shanks. Selling over 115,000 copies in its first week of release, the album debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 chart to generally favorable critical reviews. The album's lead single, an optimistic ballad called Everything, was released in March 2004 and saw some commercial success on adult contemporary radio. In an effort to avoid a censor &quot;bleep&quot; in the first line of the song, the radio and music video versions changed the word &quot;asshole&quot; to &quot;nightmare&quot;. The radio and music video version also edited out several verses from the album version. Two other singles, Out Is Through and Eight Easy Steps, soon followed but neither matched the success of &quot;Everything&quot;. A dance mix of &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; was a top ten hit on US dance music charts. In June 2004, Morissette announced her engagement to actor and fellow Canadian, Ryan Reynolds. Morissette expanded her own acting credentials with the July release of the Cole Porter biographical film De-Lovely, in which she performed the song Let&#x27;s Do It, Let&#x27;s Fall in Love and had a brief acting role as an anonymous stage performer. Her recording of the song was featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack and on The Collection. Jagged Little Pill:Acoustic and The Collection era (2005) On February 11, 2005, Morissette became a naturalized citizen of the United States while still maintaining her Canadian citizenship. Morissette refers to herself as a Canadian-American. Also in February 2005 she made a guest appearance on the Canadian television show Degrassi: The Next Generation along with Dogma co-star Jason Mewes and director Kevin Smith. To commemorate the 10 year anniversary of Jagged Little Pill, Morissette released a studio acoustic version on June 13, 2005 entitled Jagged Little Pill Acoustic. CNN reported that the album would be exclusively released through Starbucks&#x27; Hear Music retail concept through their coffee shops for a six-week run, much like Ray Charles&#x27;s successful album Genius Loves Company. This move caused much controversy, with companies such as HMV in Canada removing their entire Morissette catalog for the duration of the deal in protest. The album sold about 310 000 copies. The album went into wide release to all retail chains the last week of July. This version included enhanced features not included on the Starbuck's release version. The accompanying Jagged Little Pill: Acoustic tour ran for two months in the summer of 2005, with Morissette playing in small, intimate theatre venues. On October 14th, Morissette released a cover of the 1991 Seal song Crazy as the first single from her greatest hits album, Alanis Morissette: The Collection. The song reached number 9 on the Billboard Top 40 chart during the week of December 5. The Collection was released on November 15, 2005, followed by a limited edition version of the album on December 6, 2005. The limited edition features a DVD including a documentary with videos of two unreleased songs from Morissette's 1996 &quot;Can't Not&quot; Tour: King of Intimation and Can&#x27;t Not (the latter appeared in a reworked version on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie). The DVD also includes a 90 second clip of the unreleased video for the song &quot;Joining You&quot;. Morissette contributed a song entitled Wunderkind to the soundtrack of the film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The song was nominated for a Golden Globe award for Best Original Song. Flavors of Entanglement Morissette&#x27;s latest studio work, &quot;Flavors Of Entanglement&quot; (2008), was released June 2nd internationally and June 10th in the United States. Production of this album was done Guy Sigsworth (Madonna, Frou Frou) and the album is said by Morissette and Sigsworth to have a very different, unique sound and it drifts apart from Morissette&#x27;s past works. She even included male choruses in one of her songs, something she&#x27;s never done before. Morissette said she wrote 25 songs for Flavors, but only 11 of those made the cut. On March 6th, 2008, the final track list was published via her official website: 1. Citizen of the Planet 2. Underneath 3. Straitjacket 4. Versions of Violence 5. Not As We 6. In Praise of the Vulnerable Man 7. Moratorium 8. Torch 9. Giggling Again for No Reason 10. Tapes 11. Incomplete The other songs will be released in some other manner as Morissette said herself. Some of the other titles are &quot;On The Tequila&quot;, &quot;Limbo No More&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Bitch To Grow Up&quot;, &quot;Madness&quot;, &quot;I Am&quot;, &quot;Orchid&quot;, &quot;Wounded Leading Wounded&quot; Underneath, the lead single from Flavors of Entanglement, was released officially on April 15, 2008 in the United States and a month later in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The single was originally featured at the Elevate Film Festival, a festival of films that encourage environmental activism, on September 15, 2007. The original video featured Morissette and others swimming underwater. An official video was released with the single, featuring contrasts between Alanis&#x27; environmental activism and her romantic life, and sending the message that change a person wants to see must start in their heart. Havoc and Bright Lights The Guardian Songfacts reports that Guardian, the lead single from Havoc and Bright Lights, was released officially on May 15, 2012. ", "Placebo": "There are multiple artists with this name: 1) A popular British rock band. 2) A Belgian jazz band. 3) A Canadian punk band. 4) A British post-punk duo. 1) Placebo is a three-piece alternative rock band, formed in London, United Kingdom, when former Luxembourg schoolmates Brian Molko and Stefan Olsdal - who never actually spoke to each other at the time - met by accident at South Kensington train station in 1994. During their &#x27;accidental&#x27; meet, Molko invited Olsdal to one of his gigs, where Olsdal was impressed by Molko&#x27;s unique vocals. While briefly known as Ashtray Heart, the band soon settled on the name Placebo, after the drug that has no active ingredient but works because the patient believes it does. Soon after forming, the band could not decide on a permanent drummer, with Steve Hewitt (drums) and Robert Schultzberg both alternating on the spot. While Hewitt was the preferred choice, he was bound by other musical commitments as drummer for London-based band Breed, leading to Schultzberg being the drummer when the band signed its contract with Caroline Records. As time went on, Molko and Schultzberg began to drift apart as friends, which eventually led to Molko and Olsdal persuading Hewitt to rejoin the band shortly after their debut album was released. The singles &quot;Nancy Boy&quot;, from Placebo (1996), and &quot;Pure Morning&quot;, from Without You I&#x27;m Nothing (1998), are still to this day the peak of their British success, with both tracks charting in the top ten. Since Without You I&#x27;m Nothing, the band have fallen out of fashion, particularly with the British music press, who regularly mocked the personality and pretensions of its lead member, Brian Molko. However, the band retained a huge popular and critical following in continental Europe. Their musical style has not altered between the debut album Placebo and latest album Battle For The Sun, with their early work based around fairly straightforward guitar playing, often influenced by the style of 1970s British and American rock, and Molko&#x27;s high-pitched, nasal vocals. However, the evolution of the band has led to the experimental use of both dance music (particularly seen on Black Market Music and Sleeping With Ghosts)and orchestrated pieces on their most recent album. The band&#x27;s debut album, Placebo, was recorded between 1995 and 1996 and was followed by a tour of Europe with David Bowie. Their breakthrough is often said to have come with the single Nancy Boy, which gained large success across Europe as the band began to prepare recordings for their next offering. The second album, Without You I&#x27;m Nothing, was released in 1998. The album saw the release of single Pure Morning, which is still to this day often seen as one of the band&#x27;s most popular tracks. David Bowie lent his vocals to the title track and fourth single from the album, Without You I&#x27;m Nothing. After two years of touring and recording, Placebo returned in 2000 with their third album, Black Market Music, followed by the release of Sleeping With Ghosts in 2003. In 2004, the band released a live DVD called &quot;Soulmates Never Die&quot;, which contained live footage from a live concert in Bercy, Paris on their Sleeping With Ghosts tour. The 2003 release was followed by the singles collection, Once More With Feeling, which included two new tracks I Do and Twenty Years. Twenty Years was selected as the first and only single from the compliation, and a DVD including all their videos and an exclusive documentary interview with the band members was released in conjunction. The band&#x27;s fifth album, Meds was released on 03. 03. 06 (04. 04. 06 in the United States). The album was followed by a lengthy worldwide tour throughout 2006, and, towards the end of the year, a live, Internet-only EP, &#x27;Live at La Cigale&#x27; was released, containing six songs from Meds, and two songs from previous albums. The band also reissued their original self-titled album with extra DVD content in late 2006 to celebrate its tenth birthday. &quot;The 10 Year Anniversary Collectors Edition&quot; was released on 25. 09. 06, complete with two B-Sides (&#x27;Drowning by Numbers&#x27; and &#x27;Slackerbitch&#x27;) and two rare demos (&#x27;Paycheck&#x27; and &#x27;Flesh Mechanic&#x27;). The DVD contains performances by the band and the official videos for the singles from the &#x27;Placebo&#x27; album. In October 2007, it was announced on the band&#x27;s website that Steve Hewitt had left the band. The split was considered &#x27;amicable&#x27; by Molko, and that both sides, although disappointed, understood the decision, despite multiple rumours that reported the contrary. However, in mid-2008, Placebo, along with new drummer Steve Forrest, recorded their sixth album, Battle for the Sun, which was released in June 2009. Since it&#x27;s release, the band has been touring and promoting the album worldwide. Official site: www. placeboworld. co. uk 2) Placebo is a Belgian jazz band. Leader Marc Moulin (already a veteran by the early 70&#x27;s since he started in 63 with saxman Scorier) was the main composer of this rather large group (they had a four-man brass section) somewhere between Nucleus and a funky Chicago Transit Authority but with that bizarre and sometimes weird/silly Belgian spirit/absurdism. Their three albums (from 71 to 74) were widely played on the alternative scene in the early 70&#x27;s, so much so, that they appeared in concert on National TV (still to be released commercially but aired two years ago). Their debut &quot;Balls of Eyes&quot; is maybe their better one (it won a prize at 1972&#x27;s Montreux Jazz Festival), but the 1973 album is not far behind. After a rather disappointing eponymous album (on the Harvest label), they slowly disbanded, giving their last concert in 76. Marc Moulin will then have a long solo career (his best album being Sam Suffy in 75), diddle in Eurovision spoof-group Telex, work with great Belgian group Cos (see their entry), produced many artist (Philip Catherine a. o. ), host his own radio show, had his own record label and for the last 15 years has been a precursor in acid-jazz. Although none of their vinyls have received a CD reissue (yet), there is now a compilation that is really an excellent introduction and the track selection suffers no discussion: you are getting the best one possible. Actually their records gained back some interest since they were sampled a few times for Trip-hop records. 3) Feist was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo as early as age 15 in 1991. 4) In 1982 Gary and Michelle Wild (a married couple) found their way to the small village of Pity Me near Durham and laid down nine tracks at Guardian Studios. The resulting LP was entitled &#x27;England&#x27;s Trance&#x27; and issued by Aura Records the same year.

Nick Murphy settled on the stage name Chet Faker as an homage to Chet Baker. Other influences he has cited include Bob Dylan, as well as his mother&#x27;s Motown albums and his father&#x27;s &quot;chilled out Ibiza CDs&quot;. He first rose to prominence after his cover of Blackstreet&#x27;s &quot;No Diggity&quot; went viral online, reaching #1 on the Hypemachine chart in May 2011. He released his first EP Thinking In Textures in 2012 to positive reviews, being described as &quot;wonderfully loungey&quot; and praised for its ability to &quot;mix subtlety with impressive beauty&quot;. The EP was also popular with fans, with single &quot;I&#x27;m Into You&quot; landing at number 24 on the 2012 Triple J Hottest 100 chart. Faker has worked with several other artists since the release of his debut EP, including collaborations with Flume and remixes of songs by MS MR and The Temper Trap. He was a featured vocalist on Say Lou Lou&#x27;s &quot;Fool of Me&quot;, which was named Best New Track by Pitchfork in May 2013. He released a new single featuring Kilo Kish on 12 August 2013. In September of 2013, Flume announced that he and Faker had recorded an EP, stating that the final result &quot;doesn&#x27;t sound particularly like Flume or specifically like, you know, a Chet Faker record it really is kinda like a hybrid of both sounds going to one&quot; and he feels like everything they did with the EP &quot;was collaborative about the whole effort, and I think that shines through. &quot; Faker&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Built on Glass&quot;, was released on 11 April 2014, which was preceded by the release of lead single &quot;Talk Is Cheap&quot; and its accompanying music video on February 11. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Charts. ", "Burial": "There are multiple artists with the name Burial: 1) Burial is an electronic musician from south London. His debut album was released in 2006 to critical acclaim. The Wire magazine named it their album of the year and it came fifth in the Mixmag 2006 Album of the Year list. On Friday, September 28th 2007, a new Burial album was announced, and Untrue was released 6 weeks later on November 5th. Although both albums have been met with much critical acclaim, Burial remained anonymous until August 2008, stating in a past interview that &quot;only five people know I make tunes&quot;. In February 2008, The Independent reported that Burial was an alumnus of south London&#x27;s Elliott School named William Bevan (another alumnus, Hot Chip&#x27;s Joe Goddard, said in 2006 that Burial was in the year above him). The school&#x27;s alumni also include Kieran Hebden aka Four Tet, with whom Bevan has collaborated. William Bevan is also the name of a funeral directors located in Ross-on-Wye, England.

After the removal of Matsuda in 1987, Ueno left the group in 1993 and Kira continued under the name ZABADAK as a solo artist until March 2011, when his wife, vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Koko Komine (Xiao Feng Gong Zi ), joined the band. The sound of ZABADAK has been strongly influenced by both Celtic and progressive music. ", "Chante Moore": "Born to a gospel minister, she grew up singing in the church and was heavily influenced by the music of George Duke and Lee Ritenour. While in high school, she decided to make a career of singing. She was a successful beauty pageant contestant and model when she was discovered by the late Louil Silas at 22, a record executive who had started his own label, Silas Records, then distributed by MCA. Moore has recorded several hit records, including &quot;Love&#x27;s Taken Over&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m What You Need&quot;, &quot;Old School Lovin&quot;, and &quot;Free&quot; (a cover of a Deniece Williams song that showcases her effortless flip into whistle register by jumping an octave higher than the song&#x27;s original top note). Moore was also featured on the soundtrack of Waiting To Exhale in 1995 with the song &quot;Wey U,&quot; which also shows off her ability to reach the whistle register. Once married to Kadeem Hardison, she then married to Kenny Lattimore, with whom she is now divorced. The two are currently a duet act on Jive Records, where they remade Minnie Riperton and Peabo Bryson&#x27;s 70&#x27;s soul hit &quot;Here We Go&quot; on their album, Things That Lovers Do. It is interesting to note that Chante is still signed as a catalog artist with MCA. In 2000, Moore earned a Soul Train Music Awards nomination, alongside Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, for &quot;Single of the Year, Female&quot; for her Billboard No. 2 R&amp;B / No. 10 Pop hit &quot;Chante&#x27;s Got a Man&quot;. However, she lost the award to Lauryn Hill. The single was also certified Gold by the RIAA for sales of over 500,000 copies in America. In 2002, she won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul Single, Group, Band or Duo for &quot;Contagious&quot; featuring The Isley Brothers. She also appeared on the hit UPN show Girlfriends, singing Minnie Riperton&#x27;s Lovin&#x27; You. In 2002, Moore sang on Kenny G&#x27;s single &quot;One More Time,&quot; which registered on the Smooth Jazz and Adult Contemporary singles charts. In 2006 Asian singer Hyori remade Moore&#x27;s single &quot;Straight Up&quot;, it became a top ten hit in Korea. Additionally, in 2006 it was confirmed by Peak Records executive and founder that Chante Moore has signed a record deal with the independent label. Moore released her fifth solo album Love the Woman on June 17, 2008. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Ain&#x27;t Supposed to Be This Way&quot; impacted radio on May 12, 2008. In 2009, Moore set some dates for a Love the Woman tour, with performances in Los Angeles, and Atlanta, Georgia. Additionally, she starred with James Pickens, Jr. (of Grey&#x27;s Anatomy), Vickie Winans, Loretta Devine, Reginald VelJohnson, Rocky Carroll and Kenny Lattimore in a live stage production of Otis Sallid&#x27;s Gospel! Gospel! Gospel at the Wilshire Ebell Theater in May 2009. In July 2011, it was announced that she would be the TV host for an upcoming women&#x27;s fitness reality series sponsored by SportyGirl Fitness. The following year, Moore performed at the 2012 BET Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in a tribute to the late singer Donna Summer. On January 1, 2013, Moore inked a new record deal with Shanachie Entertainment. She released her sixth studio solo album &quot;Moore is More&quot; on July 30, 2013 which was preceded by the single &quot;Talking In My Sleep. &quot; In early 2013, it was announced that Moore had joined the cast of the Reality TV show &quot;R&amp;B Divas L. A. &quot; with Kelly Price, Dawn Robinson (of En Vogue), Michel&#x27;le, Lil&#x27; Mo &amp; Claudette Ortiz. They filmed the series throughout the year, and it premiered/aired during the summer. Currently, Moore is set to join Tom Joyner&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Voyage 2014&quot; Cruise, and is contracted to star on Broadway in the 2014 musical &quot;Gospel Soul Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;.

To date, her YouTube channel boasts over ONE MILLION YouTube Subscribers with over 89 million views. Now, two EP's later Handmade Songs, which Kelly self-penned, produced, mixed and released, and Foreword, she plans to release her first full length debut this spring. Kelly co-wrote \"Nobody Love\" off her 2015 Spring debut alongside Rickard Goransson and Max Martin. Martin says, &quot;After hearing Tori sing, we felt so inspired that we had no choice but to get involved. It's been such a pleasure to be a part of her journey. \" She also co-wrote with such vets as Savan Kotecha, Toby Gad, Claude Kelly, Chuck Harmony, Wolf Cousins, and Ed Sheeran. The album, she says, does not depart from her soulful roots. \"It's like a marriage between that soulful urban thing and a mainstream pop vibe. It was hard to get to that place, but once we had 'Nobody Love,' I knew we'd cracked the code. It felt seamless. \" Working with one of the most successful hit makers in the industry is a long way from Kelly's early years making songs in her bedroom and posting them online.

That&#x27;s always the dream. \"", "Pink Floyd": "Pink Floyd are a psychedelic/progressive rock band formed in Cambridge, England, United Kingdom in 1965. Pink Floyd is one of rock&#x27;s most successful and influential acts, having sold over 200 million albums worldwide and with 74. 5 million certified units in the United States, making them one of the best-selling artists of all time. Currently the band consists of David Gilmour (vocals, guitar) and Nick Mason (drums). The band&#x27;s classic lineup was Roger Waters (vocals, bass), David Gilmour (vocals, guitar), Rick Wright (organ, keyboards, vocals) and Nick Mason (drums). Gilmour was brought into the band in 1968 to replace the band&#x27;s founder, singer, guitarist and songwriter Syd Barrett, who had become increasingly erratic and departed from the band a few months after Gilmour&#x27;s addition. The band became known for their advancements in the genres of psychedelic rock and progressive rock music, philosophical lyrics, avant-garde compositions, sonic experimentation, innovative cover art and elaborate live shows. Pink Floyd enjoyed modest success in the late-1960s as a psychedelic band led by Syd Barrett. Barrett's increasingly erratic behavior eventually caused his colleagues to replace him after The Piper at the Gates Of Dawn with guitarist David Gilmour. The band went on to record several elaborate concept albums; achieving worldwide success with 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon (The second best-selling album of all time), 1975's Wish You Were Here , 1977's Animals , and 1979's The Wall , among the best-selling, most critically acclaimed, and enduringly popular albums in rock music history. In 1985, singer and bassist Roger Waters declared Pink Floyd defunct. However, the remaining members continued recording and touring under the name, eventually reaching a settlement with Waters giving them rights to the name and most of the songs. Pink Floyd evolved from an earlier band, formed in 1964, which was at various times called Sigma 6, The Meggadeaths, The Screaming Abdabs, and The Abdabs. When this band split up, some members -- guitarists Bob Klose and Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason, and wind instrument player Rick Wright -- formed a new band called Tea Set, and were joined shortly thereafter by guitarist Syd Barrett, who became the band's primary vocalist as well. When Tea Set found themselves on the same bill as another band with the same name, Barrett came up with an alternative name on the spur of the moment, choosing The Pink Floyd Sound (after two blues musicians, Pink Anderson and Floyd Council). For a time after this they oscillated between 'Tea Set' and 'The Pink Floyd Sound', with the latter name eventually winning out. The word Sound was dropped fairly quickly, but the definite article was still used occasionally for several years afterward, up to about the time of the More soundtrack. In the early days, the band covered rhythm and blues staples such as \"Louie, Louie\", but gained notoriety for psychedelic interpretations, with extended improvised sections and 'spaced out' solos. The heavily jazz-oriented Klose left the band to become a photographer shortly before Pink Floyd started recording, leaving an otherwise stable lineup with Barrett on lead guitar, Waters on bass guitar, Mason on drums and Wright switching to keyboards. Barrett started writing his own songs, influenced by American and British psychedelic rock with his own brand of whimsical humor. Pink Floyd became a favorite in the underground movement, playing at such prominent venues as the UFO club, the Marquee Club and the Roundhouse. As their popularity increased, the band members formed Blackhill Enterprises in October 1966, a six-way business partnership with their managers, Peter Jenner and Andrew King, issuing the singles &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; in March 1967 and \"See Emily Play\" in June 1967. \"Arnold Layne\" reached number 20 in the UK Singles Chart, and \"See Emily Play\" reached number 6, granting the band its first TV appearance on Top of the Pops in July 1967. Released in August 1967, the band's debut album, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn , is today considered to be a prime example of British psychedelic music, and was generally well-received by critics at the time, and it is now viewed as one of the better debut albums by many critics. The album's tracks, predominantly written by Barrett, showcase poetic lyrics and an eclectic mixture of music, from the avant-garde free-form piece &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; to whimsical songs such as &quot;The Scarecrow&quot;, inspired by the Fenlands, a rural region north of Cambridge (Barrett, Gilmour and Waters's home town). Lyrics were entirely surreal and often referred to folklore, such as &quot;The Gnome&quot;. The music reflected newer technologies in electronics through its prominent use of stereo panning and electric keyboards. The album was a hit in the UK where it peaked at #6, but did not get much attention in North America, reaching #131 in the U. S. During this period, the band toured with The Jimi Hendrix Experience, which helped to increase its popularity. As the band became more and more popular, the stresses of life on the road and a significant intake of psychedelic drugs took their toll on Barrett, whose mental health had been deteriorating for several months. While Barrett's behavior has often been attributed to his drug use, there are many who think that a pre-existing condition, possibly schizophrenia, was equally to blame. In January 1968, guitarist David Gilmour joined the band to carry out Syd's playing and singing duties. With Barrett's behavior becoming less and less predictable, and his almost constant use of LSD, he became very unstable, often staring into space while the rest of the band performed. During some performances, he would simply strum one chord for the duration of a concert, or simply begin detuning his guitar. The band's live shows became increasingly ramshackle until, eventually, the other band members simply stopped taking him to the concerts. It was originally hoped that Syd would write for the band with Gilmour performing live, similar to how the Beach Boys had done with Brian Wilson. However, due to Barrett's increasingly difficult compositions, such as &quot;Have You Got It Yet?\", which changed melodies and chord progression with every take, eventually made the rest of the band give up on this arrangement. Once Barrett's departure was formalized in April 1968, producers Jenner and King decided to remain with him, and the six-way Blackhill partnership was dissolved. The band adopted Steve O'Rourke as manager, and he remained with Pink Floyd until his death in 2003. Musically, this period was one of experimentation for the band. Gilmour, Waters and Wright each contributed material that had its own voice and sound, giving this material less consistency than the Barrett-dominated early years or the more polished, collaborative sound of later years. Waters mostly wrote low-key, jazzy melodies with dominant bass lines and complex, symbolic lyrics, Gilmour focused on guitar-driven blues jams, and Wright preferred melodic psychedelic keyboard-heavy numbers. Unlike Waters, Gilmour and Wright preferred tracks that had simple lyrics or that were purely instrumental. Some of the band's most experimental music is from this period, such as &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, consisting largely of feedback and atonal screeches and loops, \"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving with a Pict\", which is a series of sped-up voice samples resembling rodents chattering that reaches its climax in an incomprehensible Scottish dialect monologue, and \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\" (performed under different names during this period), a very Waters-driven song with a bass and keyboard-heavy jam culminating in crashing drums and Waters's primal screams. Whilst Barrett had written the bulk of the first album, only one Barrett composition, the Piper outtake \"Jugband Blues\", appeared on the second Floyd album. A Saucerful of Secrets was released in June 1968, reaching #9 in the UK and becoming the only Pink Floyd album not to chart in the U. S. Somewhat uneven due to Barrett's departure, the album still contained much of his psychedelic sound combined with the more experimental music that would be fully showcased on Ummagumma . Hints of the epic, lengthy songs to come are in its centerpiece, the 12-minute title track, but the album was poorly received by critics at the time, although critics today tend to be kinder to the album in the context of their body of work. Future Floyd albums would expand upon the idea of long, sprawling compositions, offering more focused songwriting with each subsequent release. Pink Floyd were then recruited by director Barbet Schroeder to produce a soundtrack for his film, More, which premiered in May 1969. The music was released as a Floyd album in its own right, Music From the Film More , in July 1969; the album achieved another #9 finish in the UK, and peaked at #153 in the U. S. The band would use this and future soundtrack recording sessions to produce work that may not have fit into the idea of what would appear on a proper Pink Floyd LP; many of the tracks on More (as fans usually call it) were acoustic folk songs, although critics tend to find the collection of the film's music patchy and uneven. Two of these songs, \"Green Is the Colour\" and \"Cymbaline\", became fixtures in the band's live sets for a time, as can be heard in the many available bootleg recordings from this period. The latter was also the first Pink Floyd song to deal with Roger Waters's cynical attitude toward the music industry explicitly. The rest of the album consisted of incidental music with a few heavier rock songs thrown in, such as \"The Nile Song\". The next record, the double album Ummagumma , was a mix of live recordings and unchecked studio experimentation by the band members, with each member recording half a side of a vinyl record as a solo project (Mason's first wife makes an uncredited contribution as a flautist). Though the album was realized as solo outings and a live set, it was originally intended as a purely avant-garde mixture of sounds from \"found\" instruments. The subsequent difficulties in recording and lack of group organization led to the shelving of the project. The title is slang for sexual procreation, and reflects the attitude of the band at the time, as frustrations in the studio followed them throughout these sessions. Wildly experimental on the studio disc (except for Waters's pure folk \"Grantchester Meadows\"), with atonal and jarring piano pieces (\"Sysyphus\"), meandering folk guitar (\"The Narrow Way\") and large percussion solos, the live disc featured excellent performances of some of their most popular psychedelic-era compositions and caused critics to receive the album more positively than the previous two albums. With fans, the album was Pink Floyd's most popular release yet, hitting UK #5 and making the U. S. charts at #74. 1970's Atom Heart Mother , the band's first recording with an orchestra, was a collaboration with avant-garde composer Ron Geesin. One side of the album consisted of the title piece, a 23-minute long rock-orchestral suite. The second side featured one song from each of the band's then-current vocalists (Roger Waters's folk-rock \"If\", David Gilmour's bluesy \"Fat Old Sun\" and Rick Wright's psychedelic \"Summer '68\"). Another lengthy piece, \"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\", was a sound collage of a man cooking and eating breakfast and his thoughts on the matter, linked with instrumentals. The use of incidental sound effects and voice samples would thereafter be an important part of the band's sound. While Atom Heart Mother was considered a huge step back for the band at the time and is still considered one of its most inaccessible albums, it had the best chart performance for the band so far, reaching #1 in the UK and #55 in the U. S. , although it has since been described by Gilmour as &quot;a load of rubbish&quot; and Waters as suitable for &quot;throwing in the dustbin and never listened to by anyone ever again. &quot; The album was another transitional piece for the group, hinting at future musical territory such as \"Echoes\" in its ambitious title track. The popularity of the album allowed Pink Floyd to embark on its first full U. S. tour. Before releasing its next original album, the band released a compilation album, Relics , which contained several early singles and B-sides, along with one original song (Waters's jazzy \"Biding My Time\"). This is the period in which the Floyd shed their association with the \"psychedelic\" scene (and its association with Barrett) and became a distinctive band that are difficult to classify. The divergent styles of Gilmour, Waters and Wright (Mason's writing contributions to the group were minimal) were merged into a unique sound. This era contains what many consider to be two of the band's masterpiece albums, The Dark Side of the Moon and Wish You Were Here . The sound became polished and collaborative, with the philosophic lyrics and distinctive bass lines of Waters combining with the unique blues guitar style of Gilmour and Wright's light keyboard melodies. Gilmour was the dominant vocalist throughout this period, and female choirs and Dick Parry's saxophone contributions in the studio became a notable part of the band's style. The sometimes atonal and harsh sound exhibited in the band's earlier years gave way to a very smooth, mellow and soothing sound, and the band's epic, lengthy compositions reached their zenith with \"Echoes\" from Meddle (although \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\" exceeded it in total length, it was split in two pieces as the opening and closing of Wish You Were Here ). This period was not only the beginning but the end of the truly collaborative era of the band; after 1975 Waters's influence became more dominant musically as well as lyrically. Wright's last credited composition and last lead vocal on a studio album until 1994's The Division Bell were in this period, and Gilmour's writing credits sharply declined in frequency until Waters left the band in 1985. The last ties with Barrett were severed in musical, as well as literal, fashion with Wish You Were Here , whose epic tracks \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts I-V)\"/&quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Parts VI-IX)&quot; were written both as a tribute and elegy to their friend. The band's sound was considerably more focused on Meddle (1971), with the 23-minute epic \"Echoes\" taking up the second side of the LP. \"Echoes\" is a smooth progressive rock song with extended guitar and keyboard solos and a long segue in the middle consisting largely of synthesized whale song produced on guitar, along with samples of seagull cries, described by Waters as a \"sonic poem\". Meddle was considered by Nick Mason to be \"the first real Pink Floyd album. It introduced the idea of a theme that can be returned to. \" The album had the sound and style of the succeeding breakthrough-era Pink Floyd albums but stripped away the orchestra that was prominent in Atom Heart Mother . Meddle also included the atmospheric \"One of These Days\", a concert favorite featuring Nick Mason's menacing one-line vocal ( \"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces\" ), distorted and bluesy slide guitar, and a melody that at one point segues into a throbbing synthetic pulse quoting the theme tune of the cult classic science fiction television show Doctor Who. The mellow feeling of the next three albums is very present on \"Fearless\", and this track displays a country influence, as does the prominent pedal steel guitar on \"A Pillow of Winds\". The latter track is one of the Floyd's very few acoustic love songs. Waters's role as lead songwriter began to take form, with his jazzy \"San Tropez\" brought to the band practically completed. Meddle was greeted both by critics and fans enthusiastically, and Pink Floyd were rewarded with a #3 album chart peak in the UK; it only reached #70 in U. S. charts, partly because Capitol Records had not provided it with enough publicity support. Today, Meddle remains one of their most well-regarded efforts. Obscured by Clouds was released in 1972 as the soundtrack to the film La Vallee , another art house film by Barbet Schroeder. This was the band's first U. S. Top 50 album (where it hit #46), hitting at #6 in the UK. While Mason described the album years later as \"sensational\", it is less well-regarded by critics. The lyrics of \"Free Four\", the first Pink Floyd song to achieve significant airplay in the U. S. , introduced Waters's ruminations on his father's death in World War II which would figure in subsequent albums. Two other songs on the album, \"Wots. . . uh, the Deal\" and \"Childhood's End\", also hint at themes used in later albums, the former focusing on loneliness and desperation which would come to full fruit in the Roger Waters-led era, and the latter hinting much at the next album, fixated on life, death and the passage of time. \"Childhood's End\", inspired by the Arthur C. Clarke book of the same name, was also Gilmour's last lyrical contribution for 15 years. The album was, to an extent, stylistically different from the preceding Meddle, with the songs generally being shorter, often taking a somewhat pastoral approach compared to the atmospheric use of sound effects and keyboard on sections of Meddle, and sometimes even running into folk rock, blues rock and piano-driven soft rock (\"Burning Bridges\", \"The Gold It's in the. . . \" and \"Stay\" being the best respective examples for each). The release of Pink Floyd's massively successful 1973 album, The Dark Side of the Moon , was a watershed moment in the band's popularity. Pink Floyd had stopped issuing singles after 1968's \"Point Me At The Sky\" and was never a hit-single-driven group, but The Dark Side of the Moon featured a U. S. Top 20 single (\"Money\"). The album became the band's first #1 on U. S. charts, a huge improvement over its previous recordings. The critically-acclaimed album stayed on the Billboard Top 200 for an unprecedented 741 weeks (including 591 consecutive weeks from 1976 to 1988), establishing a world record and making it one of the top-selling albums of all time. It also remained 301 weeks on UK charts, despite never rising higher than #2 there, and is highly praised by critics. Saxophone forms an important part of the album's sound, exposing the band's jazz influences, and female backing vocals play a key role in helping to diversify the album's texture. For example, straight rock songs such as \"Money\" and \"Time\" are placed on either side of mellow pedal steel guitar sounds (reminiscent of Meddle ) in \"Breathe\" and female vocal-laden song \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" (with Clare Torry on lead vocal), while minimalist instrumental \"On the Run\" is performed almost entirely on a single synthesizer. Incidental sound effects and snippets of interviews feature alongside the music, many of them taped in the studio. The album's lyrics and sound attempt to describe the different pressures that everyday life places upon human beings. This concept (conceived by Waters in a band meeting around Mason's kitchen table) proved a powerful catalyst for the band and together they drew up a list of themes, several of which would be revisited by Waters on later albums, such as \"Us and Them\"'s musings on violence and the futility of war, and the themes of insanity and neurosis discussed in \"Brain Damage\". The album's complicated and precise sound engineering by Alan Parsons set new standards for sound fidelity; this trait became a recognizable aspect of the band's sound and played a part in the lasting chart success of the album, as audiophiles constantly replaced their worn-out copies. Seeking to capitalize on its newfound fame, the band also released a compilation album, A Nice Pair , which was a gatefold repackaging of The Piper at the Gates of Dawn and A Saucerful of Secrets . It was also during this period that director Adrian Maben released the first Pink Floyd concert film, Live at Pompeii . The original theatrical cut featured footage of the band performing in 1971 at an amphitheater in Pompeii with no audience present (only the film crew and stage staff). Fortuitously, Maben also happened to capture some interviews and behind-the-scenes glimpses of the band during recording sessions for Dark Side of the Moon at Abbey Road Studios, some of which were incorporated alongside other new footage between songs in later versions of Live at Pompeii . Wish You Were Here , released in 1975, carries an abstract theme of absence: absence of any humanity within the music industry and, most poignantly, the absence of Syd Barrett. Well-known for its popular title track, the album includes the largely instrumental, nine-part song suite \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", a tribute to Barrett in which the lyrics deal explicitly with the aftermath of his breakdown. Many of the musical influences in the band's past were brought together -- atmospheric keyboards, blues guitar pieces, extended saxophone solos (by Dick Parry), jazz fusion workouts and aggressive slide guitar -- in the suite's different linked parts, culminating in a funeral dirge played with synthesized horn. The remaining tracks on the album, \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Have a Cigar\", harshly criticize the music industry; the latter is sung by British folk singer Roy Harper. It was the first Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and the U. S. charts, and critics praise it just as enthusiastically as Dark Side of the Moon . In a famous anecdote, a heavyset man with a completely shaved head and eyebrows wandered into the studio while the band was recording \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\". The band could not recognize him for some time, when suddenly one of them realized it was Syd Barrett. He was greeted enthusiastically by the band but subsequently slipped away during the impromptu party for David Gilmour's wedding (which was, coincidentally, also on that day). It was the last time any of the other band members saw him. Gilmour recently confirmed this story, although he could not recall which song they were working on when Syd showed up. Barrett's eyebrow-shaving tendencies would later be revisited in the movie Pink Floyd: The Wall . During this era, Waters asserted more and more control over Pink Floyd's output. Wright's influence became largely inconsequential, and he was fired from the band during the recording of The Wall . Much of the music from this period is considered secondary to the lyrics, which explore Waters's feelings about his father's death in World War II and his increasingly cynical attitude towards political figures such as Margaret Thatcher and Mary Whitehouse. Although still finely nuanced, the music grew more guitar-based at the expense of keyboards and saxophone, both of which became (at best) part of the music's background texture along with the obligatory sound effects. A full orchestra (even larger than the brass ensemble from Atom Heart Mother ) plays a significant role on The Wall and especially The Final Cut . By January 1977, and the release of Animals (UK #2, U. S. #3), the band's music came under increasing criticism from some quarters in the new punk rock sphere as being too flabby and pretentious, having lost its way from the simplicity of early rock and roll. Animals was, however, considerably more basic-sounding than the previous albums, due to either the influence of the burgeoning punk-rock movement or the fact that the album was recorded at Pink Floyd's new (and somewhat incomplete) Britannia Row Studios. The album was also the first to not have a single songwriting credit for Rick Wright. Animals again contained lengthy songs tied to a theme, this time taken in part from George Orwell's Animal Farm, which used \"Pigs\", \"Dogs\" and \"Sheep\" as metaphors for members of contemporary society. Despite the prominence of guitar, keyboards and synthesizers still play an important role on Animals , but the saxophone and female vocal work that defined much of the previous two albums' sound is absent. The result is a more hard-rock effort overall, bookended by two parts of a quiet acoustic piece. Many critics did not respond well to the album, finding it \"tedious\" and \"bleak\", although some celebrated it for almost those very reasons. For the cover artwork, a giant inflatable pig was commissioned to float between the chimney towers of London's Battersea Power Station. However, the wind made the pig balloon difficult to control, and in the end it was necessary to matte a photo of the pig balloon onto the album cover. The pig nevertheless became one of the enduring symbols of Pink Floyd, and inflatable pigs were a staple of the band's live shows from then on. 1979's epic rock opera The Wall , conceived by Waters, dealt with the themes of loneliness and failed communication, which were expressed by the metaphor of a wall built between a rock artist and his audience. This album gave Pink Floyd renewed acclaim and another chart-topping single with \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\". The Wall also included the future concert staples \"Comfortably Numb\" and \"Run Like Hell\", with the former in particular becoming a cornerstone of album-oriented rock and classic-rock radio playlists as well as one of the group's best-known songs. The album was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, a friend of Waters who shared songwriting credits on \"The Trial\" and from whom the band later temporarily distanced themselves after quarreling with him over several contentious issues. Even more than during the Animals sessions, Waters was asserting his artistic influence and leadership over the band, which prompted increased conflicts with the other members. The music had become distinctly more hard-rock, although the large orchestrations on some tracks recalled an earlier period, and there are a few quieter songs interspersed throughout (such as \"Goodbye Blue Sky\" and \"Nobody Home\"). Wright's influence was completely minimized, and he was fired from the band during recording, only returning on a fixed wage for the live shows in support of the album. Ironically, Wright was the only member of Pink Floyd to make any money from The Wall concerts, the rest covering the extensive cost overruns of their most spectacular concerts yet. Despite never hitting #1 in the UK (it reached #3), The Wall spent 15 weeks atop the U. S. charts during 1980. Critics praised it, and it has sold over 30 million copies worldwide. It is the third-best selling album of all time in the U. S and the best selling album by a single artist to be released during the 1970s. It has been certified 23x platinum by the RIAA, for sales of 11. 5 million copies in U. S. alone. The huge commercial success of The Wall made Pink Floyd the only artists since the The Beatles to have the best selling albums of two years (1973 and 1980) in less than a decade. A film entitled Pink Floyd: The Wall was released in 1982, incorporating essentially all of the music from the album. The film, written by Waters and directed by Alan Parker, starred The Boomtown Rats founder Bob Geldof and featured striking animation by noted British artist and cartoonist Gerald Scarfe. It grossed over $14 million at the North American box office. A song which first appeared in the movie, \"When the Tigers Broke Free\", was released as a single on a limited basis. This song was finally made widely available on the compilation album Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd and the re-release of The Final Cut . Also in the film is the song \"What Shall We Do Now?\", which was cut out of the original album due to the time constraints of vinyl records. The only song from the album not used was \"Hey You\", but a sequence was filmed using the song and it only exists as raw footage with poor visual quality but very good audio quality. It was released for the first time as a bonus with the extras section of the 1999 DVD release as a deleted scene. 1983 saw the release of The Final Cut , dedicated to Roger Waters's father, Eric Fletcher Waters. Even darker in tone than The Wall , this album re-examined many previous themes, while also addressing then-current events, including Waters's anger at Britain's participation in the Falklands War, the blame for which he laid squarely at the feet of political leaders (\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\"). It concludes with a cynical and frightening glimpse at the possibility of nuclear war (\"Two Suns in the Sunset\"). Michael Kamen and Andy Bown contributed keyboard work in lieu of Richard Wright's departure, which had not been formally announced before the album's release. Though technically a Pink Floyd album, the LP's front cover displayed no words, only the back cover reading: \"The Final Cut - A requiem for the post war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd: Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Nick Mason\" . Roger Waters received the sole songwriting credit for the entire record, which became a prototype in sound and form for later Waters solo projects. Waters has since said that he offered to release the record as a solo album, but the rest of the band rejected this idea. However, in his book Inside Out , drummer Nick Mason says that no such discussions ever took place. Gilmour reportedly asked Waters to hold back the release of the album so that he could write enough material to contribute, but this request was refused. The music's tone is largely similar to The Wall 's but somewhat quieter and softer, resembling songs like \"Nobody Home\" more than \"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\". It is also more repetitive, with certain leitmotifs cropping up continually. Only moderately successful with fans by Floyd's standards (UK #1, U. S. #6), but reasonably well-received by critics, the album yielded one minor radio hit, \"Not Now John\", the only hard rock song on the album (and the only one partially sung by Gilmour). The arguments between Waters and Gilmour at this stage are rumored to be so bad that they were supposedly never seen in the recording studio simultaneously, and Gilmour's co-producer credit was dropped from the album sleeve (though he received attendant royalties). There was no tour for the album, although parts of it were performed live by Waters on his subsequent solo jaunts. After The Final Cut was released , the band members went their separate ways and spent time working on individual projects. Gilmour was the first to complete his solo album, releasing About Face in March 1984. Wright joined forces with Dave Harris of Fashion to form Zee, which released the experimental album Identity a month after Gilmour's project. In May 1984, Waters released The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking , a concept album once proposed as a Pink Floyd project. A year after his band mates' projects, Mason released the album Profiles , a collaboration with Rick Fenn of 10cc which featured guest appearances by Gilmour and UFO keyboardist Danny Peyronel. Waters announced in December of 1985 that he was departing Pink Floyd, describing the band as \"a spent force creatively\" , but in 1986 Gilmour and Mason began recording a new Pink Floyd album. At the same time, Roger Waters was working on his second solo album, entitled Radio K. A. O. S. . A bitter legal dispute ensued with Waters claiming that the name \"Pink Floyd\" should have been put to rest, but Gilmour and Mason upheld their conviction that they had the legal right to continue as \"Pink Floyd. \" The suit was eventually settled out of court. After considering and rejecting many other titles, the new album was released as A Momentary Lapse of Reason (UK #3, U. S. #3). Without Waters, who had been the band's dominant songwriter for over a decade and a half, the band sought the help of outside writers. As Pink Floyd had never done this before (except for the orchestral contributions of Geesin and Ezrin), this move received much criticism. Ezrin, who had by now renewed his friendship with Gilmour, served as co-producer as well as being one of these writers. Rick Wright also returned, at first as a salaried employee during the final recording sessions, and then officially rejoining the band after the subsequent tour. Gilmour later admitted that Mason had hardly played on the album. Because of Mason and Wright's limited contributions, some critics say that A Momentary Lapse of Reason should really be regarded as a Gilmour solo effort, in much the same way that The Final Cut might be regarded as a Waters album. A year later, the band released a double live album and a concert video taken from its 1988 Long Island shows, entitled Delicate Sound of Thunder , and later recorded some instrumentals for a classic-car racing film La Carrera Panamericana , set in Mexico and featuring Gilmour and Mason as participating drivers. During the race Gilmour and manager Steve O'Rourke (acting as his map-reader) crashed. O'Rourke suffered a broken leg, but Gilmour walked away with just some bruises. The instrumentals are notable for including the first Floyd material co-written by Wright since 1975, as well as the only Floyd material co-written by Mason since Dark Side of the Moon . 1992 saw the box set release of Shine On . The 9 disc set included re-releases of the studio albums A Saucerful of Secrets , Meddle , Dark Side of the Moon , Wish You Were Here , Animals , The Wall , and A Momentary Lapse of Reason . A bonus disc entitled The Pink Floyd Early Singles was also included. The set's packaging featured a case allowing the albums to stand vertically together, with the side-by-side spines displaying an image of the Dark Side of the Moon cover. The circular text of each CD includes the almost illegible words \"The Big Bong Theory\". The band's next recording was the 1994 release The Division Bell , which was much more of a group effort than Momentary Lapse had been, with Wright now reinstated as a full and contributing band member and figuring prominently in the writing credits. The album was received more favorably by critics and fans alike than Lapse had been, but was still heavily criticized as tired and formulaic. It was the second Pink Floyd album to reach #1 on both the UK and U. S. charts. The Division Bell was another concept album, in some ways representing Gilmour's take on the same themes Waters had tackled with The Wall . The title was suggested to Gilmour by his friend Douglas Adams. Many of the lyrics were co-written by Polly Samson, Gilmour's girlfriend at the time, whom he married shortly after the album's release. Besides Samson, the album featured most of the musicians who had joined the A Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, as well as saxophonist Dick Parry, a contributor to the mid-70s Floyd albums. Anthony Moore, who had co-written the lyrics for several songs on the previous album, penned the lyrics for a tune by Wright, \"Wearing the Inside Out\", Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd record since Dark Side of The Moon . Wright and Moore's writing collaboration continued on nearly every song on Wright's subsequent solo album, Broken China . At the end of the tour in support of The Division Bell in1994, Gilmour stopped planning new music and tours for Pink Floyd, and the band went inactive. The band released a live album entitled P*U*L*S*E in 1995. It hit #1 in U. S. and featured songs recorded during The Division Bell tour, primarily from concerts in London&#x27;s Earls Court. The Division Bell concerts featured a mix of classic and modern Pink Floyd. The Pulse album has an entire performance of Dark Side of the Moon . VHS and Laserdisc versions of the concert at London&#x27;s Earls Court 20 October 1994, were also released. A DVD edition was released on 10 July 2006 and quickly topped the charts. The original edition&#x27;s CD case had an LED, timer IC, and battery which caused a red flash to blink once per second, like a heartbeat. In 1995, the band received their first and only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for &quot;Marooned&quot;. On 17 January 1996, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by The Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; frontman Billy Corgan. Roger Waters did not attend, still being antagonistic towards his former bandmates. At their acceptance speech, Gilmour - referring to the final verse of Dark Side of the Moon - said, &quot;I&#x27;ll have to grab a couple more of these for our two band members that started playing different tunes; Roger and Syd&#8230;&quot; . Although Mason was present to accept the award, he did not join Gilmour and Wright (and Billy Corgan) for their acoustic performance of &#x27;Wish You Were Here&#x27;. 1996 saw the release of Richard Wright&#x27;s second solo album, Broken China, where he collaborated again with lyricist Anthony Moore. A live recording of The Wall was released in 2000, compiled from the 1980-1981 London concerts, entitled Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980-81 . It reached #19 on the American album chart. In 2001, a remastered two-disc set of the band&#x27;s best-known tracks entitled Echoes was released. Gilmour, Mason, Waters and Wright all collaborated on the editing, sequencing, and song selection of the included tracks. Minor controversy was caused due to the songs seguing into one another non-chronologically, presenting the material out of the context of the original albums. Some of the tracks, such as &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond&quot;, &quot;Marooned&quot;, and &quot;High Hopes&quot; have had substantial sections removed from them. The album reached #2 on the UK and U. S. charts. In 2003, an SACD reissue of Dark Side of the Moon was released with new artwork on the front cover. The album was also re-released as an 180 gram, virgin vinyl pressing in 2003, which included all the original album art from the original release of the album, albeit with a new poster. Nick Mason&#x27;s book, Inside Out: A Personal History of Pink Floyd was published in 2004 in Europe and 2005 in the U. S. Long-time Pink Floyd manager Steve O&#x27;Rourke died on 30 October 2003. Gilmour, Mason and Wright reunited at his funeral and performed &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; and &quot;The Great Gig in the Sky&quot; in Chichester Cathedral in tribute. Two years later, on 2 July 2005, the band reunited for a one-off performance at the London Live 8 concert. This time, however, they were joined by Waters -- the first time all four band members were on stage together in 24 years. The band performed a four-song set consisting of &quot;Speak To Me/Breathe (Breathe In The Air)&quot;, &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, with both Gilmour and Waters sharing lead vocals. At the end of their performance Gilmour said &quot;thank you very much, good night&quot; and started to walk off the stage. Waters called him back, however, and the band shared a group hug that became one of the most famous images of Live 8. In the week after Live 8, there was a revival of interest in Pink Floyd. According to record store chain HMV, sales of Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd went up, in the following week, by 1343%, while Amazon. com reported increases in sales of The Wall at 3600%, Wish You Were Here at 2000%, The Dark Side of the Moon at 1400% and Animals at 1000%. David Gilmour subsequently declared that he would donate his share of profits from this sales boom to charity, and urged all the other artists and record companies profiting from Live 8 to do the same. On 16 November 2005 Pink Floyd were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame by Pete Townshend. Gilmour and Mason attended in person, explaining that Wright was in hospital following eye surgery, and Waters appeared on a video screen, from Rome. David Gilmour released his third solo record, On an Island , on 6 March 2006, and began a tour of small concert venues in Europe, Canada and the U. S. with a band including Richard Wright and other musicians from the post-Waters Pink Floyd tours. Roger Waters was also invited to join the band (along with Nick Mason) in London, but final rehearsals for his 2006 Europe/U. S. tour required him to decline. Nonetheless, Gilmour, Wright, and Mason&#x27;s encore performances of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; marked the first performance by Pink Floyd since Live 8. Waters was joined on stage by Mason for a few performances of Dark Side of the Moon during his 2006 tour. Wright was also invited to join Waters for the first performance, but Wright refused on the grounds that he had to work on his solo album (which remains unreleased). Waters&#x27; worldwide The Dark Side of the Moon Live tour consisted of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety along with a selection of other Pink Floyd material and a small number of songs from Waters&#x27; solo career, although no songs from The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking or Radio K. A. O. S. were included. Waters is reported to be working on a solo album, and there has been talk of him doing a Broadway musical version of The Wall , with other Pink Floyd music to be inserted. Many fans expressed hope that the band&#x27;s Live 8 appearance would lead to a reunion tour, and a record-breaking US$250 million deal for a world tour was offered, but the band made it clear that they had no such plans. In the weeks after the show, however, the rifts between the members seemed to have mostly healed. Gilmour confirmed that he and Waters are on &quot;pretty amicable terms&quot; . Waters indicated that he would like to play together again not for a whole tour but for a single event, similar to Live 8. On 31 January 2006, David Gilmour issued a joint statement on behalf of the group stating that they had no plans to reunite, refuting rumours from several media outlets. Gilmour later stated in an interview with La Repubblica that he is finished with Pink Floyd and wishes to focus on solo projects and his family. He mentions that he agreed to play Live 8 with Waters to support the cause, to make peace with Waters, and knowing he would regret not taking part. However, he states that Pink Floyd would be willing to perform for a concert &quot;that would support Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts&quot; . Then speaking with Billboard, Gilmour changed his &quot;finished with Pink Floyd&quot; sentiment to &quot;who knows&quot; . 2007 saw the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd&#x27;s signing to EMI and the 40th anniversary of the release of their first three singles &quot;Arnold Layne&quot;, &quot;See Emily Play&quot; and &quot;Apples and Oranges&quot; and their debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn . This was marked by the release of a limited edition set containing mono and stereo mixes of the albums, plus tracks from the singles and other rare recordings. On 10 May 2007, Roger Waters performed at the Syd Barrett tribute concert at the Barbican Centre in London. This was then followed by a surprise performance by the post-Waters Pink Floyd line-up of David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason of &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; to a rapturous applause and standing ovation. As it turned out, it would be the final time this configuration of Pink Floyd would ever perform together. Hopes of a second reunion concert with the band&#x27;s classic lineup were dashed when Waters did not perform with the group. Roger Waters took to the stage to screams of &quot;Pink Floyd!&quot; to which he responded, &quot;Later. &quot; Gilmour, Mason, and Wright took to the stage for what would be the final time to screams of &quot;Roger Waters!&quot; to which Gilmour politely responded, &quot;Yeah, he was here too, now the rest of us. &quot; In a January 2007 interview, Waters suggested he had become more open to a Pink Floyd reunion: \"I would have no problem if the rest of them wanted to get together. It wouldn't even have to be to save the world. It could be just because it would be fun. And people would love it. \" On 25 September 2007, Gilmour stated that a future reunion of Pink Floyd in any form, be it with or without Roger Waters, looked grim, stating that &quot;I can't see why I would want to be going back to that old thing. It's very retrogressive. I want to look forward, and looking back isn't my joy. &quot; In December 2007, Pink Floyd released a new CD box set, Oh, By the Way , containing all fourteen studio albums with their newest respective CD remasters, original vinyl artwork plus new artwork from Storm Thorgerson. Mason and Waters had said that they would be happy to do a Pink Floyd tour, but during the BBC1 Special, &quot;Which One&#x27;s Pink?,&quot; when asked about whether the band would reform, Gilmour ambiguously stated either &quot;Ain&#x27;t gonna happen&quot; or &quot;Anything could happen&quot; . Which of these two phrases were said is debatable. During the same documentary, Wright stated that he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t mind playing the Pink Floyd &#x27;music&#x27; again,&quot; but said nothing solid about reuniting with the actual members. In a May 2008 interview for BBC 6Music, David Gilmour hinted that he would be in favour of another one-off show, but ruled out a full tour: &quot;Who knows? Who knows the future? I haven&#x27;t absolutely said &#x27;no&#x27; to the possibility but I think that in reality any sort of long-term thing together is not going to happen. We did the one-off thing and that was probably enough for me but we shall see. At my incredibly advantaged age -having achieved this- I&#x27;ve earned the right to sit on my ass for a little while and consider what to do next. &quot; In 2008, Pink Floyd were awarded the Polar Music Prize for their contribution to contemporary music. Roger Waters and Nick Mason were present at the ceremony, where they received the prize from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. Speaking to Associated Press to promote the release of his new live album, David Gilmour revealed that a reunion &quot;categorically&quot; won&#x27;t happen. Gilmour said: &quot;The rehearsals were less enjoyable. The rehearsals convinced me it wasn&#x27;t something I wanted to be doing a lot of. There have been all sorts of farewell moments in people&#x27;s lives and careers which they have then rescinded, but I think I can fairly categorically say that there won&#x27;t be a tour or an album again that I take part in. It isn&#x27;t to do with animosity or anything like that. It&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ve done that. I&#x27;ve been there, I&#x27;ve done it. &quot; On 15 September 2008, Richard Wright died at age 65. He was lauded by his surviving bandmates, Gilmour in particular, for his influence on the overall sound of Pink Floyd. In April 2009, it was revealed that the band had initiated legal action against EMI, their label for over four decades, for allegedly failing to pay royalties. The dispute is reportedly connected to an ongoing disagreement with Terra Firma Capital Partners, the private equity firm who took ownership of EMI in 2007. On 10 July 2010, Roger Waters and David Gilmour performed together at a charity event for the Hoping Foundation. The event took place at Kidlington in Oxfordshire, England. The pair played to an audience of approximately 200. The event raised money for Palestinian children in order to give them a better life. Gilmour played this event in 2009, when he performed alongside Kate Moss. In return for Waters&#x27; appearance at the event, Gilmour has agreed to perform &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; at one of Waters&#x27; upcoming performances of The Wall. On 12 October 2010, Gilmour released Metallic Spheres, a collaboration with techno group The Orb In 2011, Roger Waters embarked on a tour of &quot;The Wall&quot;. He confirmed that David Gilmour would perform guitar and vocals on &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; at one of the performances. Gilmour appeared at the 12 May 2011 concert at the O2 Arena in London. Gilmour and Nick Mason joined Waters at the end of the show for a performance of &quot;Outside the Wall&quot; On 26 September 2011, Pink Floyd and EMI launched an exhaustive re-release campaign under the title Why Pink Floyd&#8230;?, reissuing the band&#x27;s back catalogue in newly remastered versions, including special &quot;Immersion&quot; multi-disc multi-format editions. All the albums have been remastered by James Guthrie, the co-producer of The Wall. On 7 July ]2014, the band announced they would be releasing their fifteenth studio album. &quot;The Endless River&quot;. The record uses the 1994 ambient session known as &quot;The Big Spliff&quot; as its basis. The &quot;Big Spliff&quot; recording was expanded upon in recording sessions in 2013 and 2014. The record will feature material recorded by the late Rick Wright for the 1994 session, but will not include Roger Waters. &quot;The Endless River&quot; is slated to be released in October 2014.

", "The War on Drugs": "The War on Drugs is an American indie rock band from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Band member Adam Granduciel (born Adam Granofsky in Dover, Massachusetts) moved from Oakland, California to Philadelphia in 2003, where he met Kurt Vile and began playing music with him. They began playing as The War on Drugs in 2005, and self-released a demo EP. While Vile and Granduciel formed the backbone of the band, they had a number of accompanists early in the group&#x27;s career, before finally settling on a lineup that added Charlie Hall as drummer/organist, Kyle Lloyd as drummer and Dave Hartley on bass. Granduciel had previously toured and recorded with The Capitol Years, and Vile has several solo albums. The group gave away its Barrel of Batteries EP for free early in 2008. Their debut LP for Secretly Canadian, Wagonwheel Blues, was released in 2008. Reviewers of the band&#x27;s music make note of its Americana overtones. The group&#x27;s sound has been described as influenced by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and My Bloody Valentine. The lineup underwent several changes, and by the end of 2008, Kurt Vile, Charlie Hall, and Kyle Lloyd had all exited the group. Granduciel and Hartley were joined by drummer Mike Zanghi as the group slimmed to three members. After Zanghi&#x27;s exit in 2010, Steven Urgo took over drum duties and Robbie Bennett joined on keys. ", "Scarface": "Scarface (born Brad Jordan, November 9, 1970) is a rapper from the South Acres neighborhood in Houston, Texas, originally known for his work as a member of the Geto Boys. He has been a solo artist since 1991, becoming one of the most popular southern rappers in the business although maintaining ties to the Geto Boys. He is known for his sometimes unique and exaggerated voice and rapping technique. Recording as Akshen, he began his career recording solo for Rap-A-Lot Records, a local label in Houston, Texas. In the late 1980s, he joined the Geto Boys as they were forming and released We Can&#x27;t Be Stopped, a highly successful LP that garnered the Geto Boys a large fanbase, in spite of their ultra-violent lyrics keeping them far from radio and MTV. Akshen changed his name to Scarface (he even changed his flow from a rapid-fire Kool G Rap-like delivery to normal flow, this time with a darker tone), after the film Scarface, saying he felt that the main character of the movie was just like him in many ways. Scarface soon released his debut solo album, Mr. Scarface Is Back. The album was a success, and Scarface&#x27;s popularity soon overshadowed the other Geto Boys. Scarface left the group and released a series of solo albums that kept him in the public view in spite of decreasing sales. He turned this around with 2000&#x27;s Last of a Dying Breed, which received overwhelmingly positive reviews and sales, and earned him Lyricist of the Year at the Source Awards. In 2002 he released The Fix, the critically acclaimed follow up to Last of a Dying Breed. In 2007 he released Made which overall recieved very positive reviews.

The group was formed in 1994 as Kara&#x27;s Flowers while its members were still in high school and originally consisted of Adam Levine (lead vocals, guitar), Jesse Carmichael (guitar, backing vocals) Mickey Madden (bass guitar) and Ryan Dusick (drums). Kara&#x27;s Flowers signed to Reprise Records and released an album, &quot;The Fourth World&quot; , in 1997. After a tepid response to the album, the band parted ways with the record label and the members attended college. Dusick and Madden stayed local at UCLA, while Levine and Carmichael relocated to the east coast to attend Five Towns College. While Levine and Carmichael were in New York, they began to take notice of the urban music surrounding them and later let the style influence the songs they wrote. In 2001, the band regrouped, with guitarist James Valentine added to the line-up, and pursued a new direction under the name: Maroon 5 . At this point, Jesse Carmichael switched to playing the keyboards and this has become his main instrument in the band (although he also plays rhythm guitar to this day). After these changes, Maroon 5 signed with Octone Records and released their debut album, &quot;Songs About Jane&quot; , in June 2002. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot;, received heavy airplay, which helped the album to debut at number six on the Billboard 200 chart. The band won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 2005 . For the next few years, the band toured extensively worldwide in support of Songs About Jane and produced two live recordings: 2004&#x27;s &quot;1. 22. 03. Acoustic&quot; and 2005&#x27;s &quot;Live Friday the 13th&quot; . In 2006, Ryan Dusick officially left the band after suffering from serious wrist and shoulder injuries and was replaced by Matt Flynn. The band recorded their second album, &quot;It Won&#x27;t Be Soon Before Long&quot; and released it in May 2007. The album reached number one on the US Billboard 200 chart and the lead single, &quot;Makes Me Wonder&quot;, became the band&#x27;s first number-one song on the Billboard Hot 100 . On September 21, 2010, the band released their third studio album entitled &quot;Hands All Over&quot; . It was re-released in 2011 to include the single &quot; Moves like Jagger &quot; (featuring Christina Aguilera). While the original version of the album received mixed reviews, &quot;Moves like Jagger&quot; reached the number one position on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The band released their next album, &quot;Overexposed&quot; , on June 26, 2012. All four singles of the album were really successful on the charts - for example, the second single from Overexposed, &quot;One More Night&quot; (released on June 19, 2012), reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2014, the band signed with Interscope Records and released their fifth studio album, &quot;V&quot; , with the very-first line-up of six official band members, as keyboardist and backing vocalist PJ Morton became an official member in 2012. The album debuted at top of the weekly Billboard 200 chart. Since its debut in 2002, the band has sold more than 15 million albums in the United States and over 100 million singles and 27 million albums worldwide. ", "Banda Uo": "Banda UO was born from the passion for tropical rhythms. In october 2010 Mateus Carrilho and Davi Sabbag made a fictitious band and a video with a Portuguese tecnobrega version of &quot;Teenage Dream&quot; (Katy Perry) as a way to spread a party. They party ended up being the most crowded in the history of their town (Goiania, BR) and they decided to keep up with the band, calling Candy Mel to seal the group with her hot chocolate &quot;brasility&quot;. They released their first EP named &quot;Me Emoldurei de Presente Pra Te Ter&quot; (I Framed Myself As a Gift To Get Ya) with Portuguese tecnobrega fusion versions of international songs. The band appeared in more than 300 blogs around the world such as Big Stereo, Mad Decent and MTV Iggy, newspappers and magazines like Rolling Stone. They&#x27;ve won a Brazilian VMA for their single &quot;Shake de Amor&quot; and released their first full-length album, &quot;Motel&quot;, in 2012. ", "The Neighbourhood": "The Neighbourhood are an American alternative rock/dark pop band that formed in Newbury Park, California, USA in August 2011. The band consists of Jesse Rutherford, Jeremy Freedman, Zach Abels, Mikey Margott and Brandon Fried. Bryan Sammis (drums) left the group in January, 2014. The band released their first EP, I&#x27;m Sorry&#8230; in January 2013, where their single Sweater Weather reached #1 on the U. S. Alternative Tracks and #8 on the U. S. Rock Tracks and #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted at #68 in Canada. Their first album, I Love You. was released on April 23, 2013. In early 2012 a mysterious band appeared online. The group, The Neighbourhood, revealed no biographical information, no photos and no backstory, offering only a moody track titled &quot;Female Robbery. &quot; Fans and the press were confounded, scouring the Internet for any information that might lead them to the identity of these musicians. Pieces of the puzzle, some reflecting reality and some not so much, began to emerge. The Neighbourhood were a quintet. They were from California despite the British spelling of their name. They had a second track, &quot;Sweater Weather,&quot; which had an accompanying &ndash; and equally dark &ndash; video. Although The Neighbourhood&#x27;s identity remained hazy, it became clear that the music they were making felt transformative to critics and fans alike. The evocative combination of rock instruments with R&amp;B and hip-hop aesthetics seemed, in many ways, revelatory, a reimagining of sounds that seemed to make people clamor for more information with even greater fervor. In April, BBC Radio One DJ Zane Lowe, an early champion of the group, let it slip that The Neighbourhood was the handiwork of musician Jesse Rutherford, a resident of Newbury Park, CA. By early May, as the band unveiled a free, self-released EP titled &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry,&quot; it became understood that the identity of this young band was, ultimately, secondary to the music itself. So who are The Neighbourhood? In essence, the group, which formed in August of 2011, is a collection of five friends who make music together. They&#x27;re headed by Rutherford, a 21-year-old singer who has dabbled in various genres, including hip-hop, before crafting the merge of sounds that categorizes The Neighbourhood&#x27;s style. Their debut EP produced by Justyn Pilbrow, who brought Emile Haynie onboard to collaborate on &quot;Female Robbery. &quot; The EP, recorded at the end of last year, is composed of shadowy, emotional music with visuals to match. And it&#x27;s all part of the band&#x27;s master plan. &quot;I always have a strong vision before I go into anything,&quot; Rutherford says. &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to make music any other way. It was all in my head, and that vision for the music was to make hip-hop beats with guitars and I was going to sing and rap over them. We wanted to do that hip-hop aesthetic on an indie platform. &quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry,&quot; a five-song disc, is a precursor to the band&#x27;s debut album, which is also being produced by Pilbrow and Haynie. The album, expected out March 2013, will expand the group&#x27;s moody sensibility, which pairs brooding layers of instrumentals with Rutherford&#x27;s hip-hop-inspired croon. The style, which the band has dubbed &quot;black and white&quot; due to its confident inspirations, is based largely in rhythm, as evidenced by the EP. &quot;When I started in music I started doing drums and then I started doing vocals,&quot; Rutherford explains. &quot;And then I combined the two together because to me rapping is just rhythmic vocals. I think the rhythm of hip-hop is really what got me into it. It&#x27;s not just words being said; it&#x27;s about how the words are said. &quot; In the end, all you need to know about The Neighbourhood is in that music and in those words. There are more facts, more pieces of the puzzle, more information to unveil. But what&#x27;s the fun in being given the full picture when you can slowly discover it for yourself? It&#x27;s better to leave some mystery lingering. Because, after all, it&#x27;s that unknowing that brought The Neighbourhood to people&#x27;s attention to begin with. ", "Grizzly Bear": "Grizzly Bear is a rock band from Brooklyn, New York. Their music uses melody and ambience in conjunction with hazy-eyed choruses, whistles, piano, banjo, and several woodwind instruments. Grizzly Bear was originally the solo project of Edward Droste (vocals/guitar), who recorded his debut album Horn of Plenty at home. The record was originally meant for his friends, but it eventually circulated and got a proper release in 2004, this time with the help of Christopher Bear (drums/vocals). A re-release with a bonus disc of remixes was issued in 2005. 2005 also saw the addition of the two other band members, Chris Taylor (woodwinds/electronics/engineering/production) and Daniel Rossen (vocals/guitar). Playing as a four piece allowed the complexity of sound that was recorded on Horn of Plenty to be played live. The band toured throughout the year, playing songs off the first album as well as some of the new songs they were collectively writing that would make up Yellow House. An album of Droste&#x27;s early demo recordings, Sorry for the Delay, was released in 2006. Later that year they signed to Warp to release Yellow House on September 4th, 2006, to great acclaim. In 2007, the band released Friend EP, which features outtakes, alternate versions, and covers done by CSS, Band of Horses, and Atlas Sound. In addition, members of the Dirty Projectors and Beirut collaborated with the band on &quot;Alligator&quot; and the EP&#x27;s hidden track. The band released their third full length album, Veckatimest, on May 26, 2009. After extensive touring, the band took a six month hiatus and then reconvened to record in Marfa, Texas and Cape Cod and released their fourth full length album, Shields, on September 18, 2012.

Girl Talk is the stage name of Gregg Gillis (born October 26, 1981). Gillis, who is based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, has released five CD albums on Illegal Art and vinyl releases on 333 and 12 Apostles. He began making music while a student at Case Western Reserve University. He specializes in sample-based remixes, in which he uses at least a dozen elements from different songs to create a new song. At his early shows, Gillis became notorious for his exhibitionist antics on stage, spontaneously removing most or all of his clothing mid-performance. He has given different explanations for the origin of his stage name, once saying it alluded to a Jim Morrison poem and once saying it alluded to an early Merzbow side project. He has also stated that &quot;Girl Talk&quot; is simply the opposite of what one would think when picturing a man playing music with a laptop. Girl Talk was featured in Good Copy Bad Copy and Rip! A Remix Manifesto; both documentary films about copyright/fair use. 2. Girl Talk is the name of a British 80&#x27;s eurodisco duo consisting of sisters Karen &amp; Julie Wright. 3.

", "Juicy J": "Jordan Michael Houston (born April 5, 1975), better known by his stage name Juicy J , is an American rapper, songwriter and record producer from Memphis, Tennessee, USA . He is a founding member of the Southern hip hop group Three 6 Mafia, established in 1991, and also the younger brother of rapper Project Pat. Together with production partner DJ Paul, Juicy J played an important role in the South&#x27;s rise to prominence within the once East and West Coast dominated rap industry. Behind the duo&#x27;s leadership, Three 6 Mafia rose from an underground phenomenon in Memphis to a nationally recognized rap empire, spinning off numerous solo albums for the collective&#x27;s many members in the mid- to late &#x27;90s. Like his production partner, Juicy J specialized in dark, eerie tracks driven by bass-heavy beats and haunting sounds. He also raps as a member of Three 6 Mafia. Moreover, Three 6 Mafia ventured into filmmaking with Choices: The Movie and Choices II: The Set-Up, a straight-to-video film starring most of the Three 6 Mafia&#x27;s collective, Hypnotize Minds. Juicy J (born Jordan Houston) and DJ Paul (Paul Beauregard) first came together at the dawn of the &#x27;90s, when they worked as DJs in the Memphis area. The two soon began producing their own tracks and invited numerous Memphis rappers to rap over the beats. They released the resulting tracks locally as Three 6 Mafia; years later these recordings would resurface as re-releases. In 1995, the loose collective Three 6 Mafia began to form and self-released its debut album, Mystic Stylez. The album became an underground success, and Three 6 Mafia, in turn, signed a distribution deal with Relativity for its Hypnotized Minds imprint. Throughout the late &#x27;90s, DJ Paul and Juicy J produced numerous albums a year for Hypnotized Minds and capitalized on the lucrative distribution deal. By the end of the decade, the two producers were at the helm of an empire, having extended their brand to alarming lengths, culminating with their commercial breakthrough album, When the Smoke Clears (2000), which debuted at number six on Billboard&#x27;s album chart. ", "Depeche Mode": "Depeche Mode are an English synthpop band, founded in 1980, originally from the town of Basildon, Essex, United Kingdom. They are one of the most enduring and successful bands to have emerged during the 80s, and particularly from the new wave/new romantic era. The band name is derived from a French fashion magazine, Depeche mode , which means &quot;fashion dispatch. &quot; The band have been highly influential in the electronic dance music scene, especially synthpop, techno and trance, in part due to their innovative work, recording techniques and use of sampling. Their most successful album is arguably 1990&#x27;s Violator, which reached the #2 position in the UK, #7 in the US, and sold over 8 million copies worldwide. The band has released a long series of high-charting singles over their three-decades long career. Enjoy the Silence is their most recognized song and is one of the most covered songs in history. The original line-up was Dave Gahan, Martin L. Gore, Andy Fletcher and Vince Clarke. In December 1981, Clarke left the band and later went on to form Yazoo, The Assembly and Erasure. Alan Wilder joined the group initially in January 1982 as a live keyboardist but became an official member in December 1982. He left mid-1995 to fully concentrate on his Recoil project and the band continued as a trio. In 2010 Wilder re-joined Depeche Mode on stage after 16 years, for a performance of Somebody during a show at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust. Depeche Mode&#x27;s origins date back to 1977, when Vince Clarke and Andrew Fletcher formed a band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass. Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke and Fletcher switched to synthesizers. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local scout hut jam session, singing to a rendition of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;, and Depeche Mode were born. While playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town, the band were approached by Daniel Miller, the founder of Mute Records, who proposed them a verbal contract. The result was their first single Dreaming of Me, recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981, reaching number 57 in the UK charts and followed soon by a real contract with Mute. As of 2006, it was estimated that Depeche Mode had sold over 100 million records (60 million albums / 40 million singles) worldwide and have had 48 songs in the UK singles chart. They are the best selling band to have never had a UK number 1 single.

Combining old school grindcore with doom and thrash elements, Pig Destroyer have pushed the boundaries of the grind genre and gained a large following. Their unique sound is notable for its absence of bass guitar on their studio albums. The band was formed in 1997 by vocalist J. R. Hayes (former vocalist Enemy Soil) in 1997, guitarist Scott Hull (Agoraphobic Nosebleed, Anal Cunt, Japanese Torture Comedy Hour, and more), and drummer John Evans. John Evans was replaced by Brian Harvey in 1998. Blake Harrison joined the band in late 2006 adding noise and samples to the mix and Brian Harvey was replaced by Adam Jarvis in 2011. His cousin John Jarvis joined in late 2013 as the band&#x27;s bassist. The band, in their earlier more 'politically-charged' days, had originally wanted to name themselves in protest of law and authority. Believing that \"Cop Killer\" and \"Cop Destroyer\" were too obvious in meaning, they eventually settled on \"Pig Destroyer\" (\"pig\" being a slang term for the police). Derived from a non-musical source as extreme as the band's sound, Pig Destroyer's easily-identifiable logo took form when the emblem from the infamous Answer Me! magazine was disassembled and rearranged. Relapse signed the band and issued a Pig Destroyer / Isis 7\" (PxDx covered the Carcass classics Genital Grinder and Regurgitation Of Giblets) on the label's Singles Series in July 2000. 38 Counts of Battery was released in 2000.

", "Ban Ben Zhen Ling": "", "Mastodon": "Mastodon is an American sludge metal/progressive metal band from Atlanta, Georgia, formed in 1999. The band comprises bassist/vocalist Troy Sanders, guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds, guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer/vocalist Brann Dailor. They have released six full-length albums to date, expanding their musical borders from early raw sludgy riffs to later psychedelic multi-layered songs, yet maintaining progressive style with unusual time signatures and odd instrumentation.                It was announced, in late 2005, that, having fulfilled contractual obligations to indie label, Relapse Records, Mastodon had been offered a deal by a major music label, a spot on the Warner Music roster. Despite this, however, Relapse Records released a DVD, and re-released the band&#x27;s only demo. An album titled Call of the Mastodon, comprising the material recorded for the band&#x27;s first and only untitled demo, which featured Eric Saner on vocals, was released in early 2006. A DVD entitled &quot;The Workhorse Chronicles&quot; was released not long after and a full length album, the band&#x27;s Warner Music debut, Blood Mountain, was released September 12th, 2006. In an interview with MTV news, Brann Dailor revealed that the band&#x27;s sound, on this upcoming release would be decidedly different and more &quot;progressive. &quot; He also expressed excitement over the possibility of the birth of a new &quot;prog movement,&quot; naming bands such as Isis, along with Mastodon, as prospective leaders of said movement. Blood Mountain met critical acclaim with reviews ranging from Metal Hammer and Kerrang! who stated it was as good or better than their last release Leviathan, while other critics view it as the essential release of the decade and UK Metal Hammer named it best album of &#x27;06. Blood Mountain also featured guest appearances by Scott Kelly of Neurosis on the track &quot;Crystal Skull&quot;, Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age on &quot;Colony of Birchmen&quot;, as well as The Mars Volta&#x27;s keyboardist Isaiah &quot;Ikey&quot; Owens on &quot;Pendulous Skin&quot; and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala on &quot;Siberian Divide&quot;. Mastodon&#x27;s fourth album Crack the Skye was released on March 24, 2009 as a normal version and a deluxe version (which includes all songs in instrumental versions as well as their normal versions). The album is produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien, and Scott Kelly of Neurosis returns as a guest musician on the title-track. The band had debuted three new tracks at the Bonnaroo Music Festival, but did not play anymore live before the album&#x27;s release, due to fears of internet distribution and wanting to play the songs to the right audience. In a MusicRadar interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed that the album is about an &quot;out of body experience,&quot; and looks at the concepts of astral travel, wormholes, Stephen Hawking&#x27;s theories and the spiritual realm. Drummer Brann Dailor has a section of vocals on the song &quot;Oblivion&quot; following the intro and chorus. The band has announced that they will play the album in its entirety incorporating a stage show on their upcoming tour. Mastodon was a headliner at the Scion Rock Fest on February 28, 2009, performing a set containing three tracks from Crack The Skye, the first time these songs were played since being finalized and recorded. Scott Kelly made an appearance performing his guest vocals for the songs &quot;Crack the Skye,&quot; &quot;Aqua Dementia,&quot; and &quot;Crystal Skull. &quot; Mastodon&#x27;s fifth album The Hunter was released on September 26, 2011 in the UK and one day later in the US via Reprise Records. The Hunter Songfacts says that the album was titled in honor of guitarist/vocalist Brent Hinds&#x27; brother, Brad, who unexpectedly passed away while hunting in December 2010. Mastodon actually had two working titles for the album in honor of Brad: &quot;The Hunter&quot; or &quot;Brother. &quot; Mastodon have previously appeared on the second stage at Ozzfest 2005 and have toured with the likes of Slayer, Lamb of God and Children of Bodom on the Unholy Alliance US tour and have 3 songs recorded live on the accompanying tour DVD. On June 24, 2014, the band released their sixth studio album &quot;Once More &#x27;Round the Sun. &quot; Mastodon is: Brann Dailor - Drums. (Formerly of Today Is The Day, Lethargy, Discordance Axis) Troy Sanders - Vocals, Bass. (Also in Social Infestation, Four Hour Fogger, Knuckle, Bully) Bill Kelliher - Guitar. (Formerly of Today Is The Day, Lethargy, Butterslax) Brent Hinds - Guitar, Vocals. (Also in Fiend Without A Face, West End Motel, The Blood Vessels, Four Hour Fogger) Aforementioned former member, Eric Saner, left the band soon after the release of the 2000 demo. Troy Sanders, the then bassist, was announced as the new lead vocalist, although vocal duties were increasingly shared with guitarist Brent Hinds to the point where they are considered co-vocalists. ", "Faith No More": "Faith No More is an alternative metal group that formed in San Francisco, California, USA in 1979. Their music combines elements of various different genres, including heavy metal, funk, hardcore punk, progressive, electronica, soul, gospel, film scores, soft rock, R&amp;B, hip hop and jazz, among many others. Faith No More formed in 1979 under the name Sharp Young Men, and later Faith No Man. This early incarnation of the band was fronted Mike &quot;The Man&quot; Morris. Roddy Bottum, Mike Bordin, and Billy Gould decided they wanted rid of him, and rather than firing him, all three quit. They changed their name to Faith No More at the suggestion of a friend (as &quot;The Man&quot; was no more). After cycling through a few guitarists, the members recruited Jim Martin. A number of singers passed through, including a brief stint by Courtney Love. Chuck Mosley became the full time singer and appeared on their first two records. Their best known song from this era is probably &quot;We Care a Lot&quot;, which satirized the prevalence of charity-related rock efforts such as Live Aid and &quot;We Are the World&quot;. The band gained a reputation for infighting and friction that sometimes went way beyond the limits of &quot;creative differences. &quot; In a notorious interview in 1987, Mosley claimed that Martin had hit him with a bottle, and there were frequent rumours of physical confrontations between band members. Indeed, in a short history of the band in one issue, the British music newspaper Melody Maker observed that the band&#x27;s internal relationships had descended into &quot;pathological hatred&quot;. Bordin in particular seemed to be very much the &quot;whipping boy&quot; of the band and the butt of numerous cruel pranks and practical jokes. It is doubtful that the band would have stayed together had they not been successful after their second album, Introduce Yourself. Mosley was fired in 1988, and replaced with singer Mike Patton. Patton would prove a more versatile singer than the monotone Mosley. At the time, he was singing with his high school band Mr. Bungle (and would continue to do so during his Faith No More years), and dropped out of Humboldt State University to join Faith No More. The group&#x27;s first record with Patton, The Real Thing, was a major hit, selling over a million copies and earning the group a grammy. Patton&#x27;s astonishing vocal range was, arguably, the salvation of Faith No More. Although never formally trained, the young ex-student was able to veer wildly from a deep, operatic bass through to screeching banshee death metal yowls and all the way up to soulful, almost feminine drawling--usually over the space of one album (as opposed to doing it in a single song as in the band Mr. Bungle). For example, the exuberant rap on &quot;Epic&quot; and the sleazy jazz vocals of &quot;Edge Of the World&quot; (on the 1989 album The Real Thing) are wildly different. This burgeoning singing ability enabled the band to expand and develop far further. Keyboardist Bottum memorably described his new colleague as &quot;a pair of lungs on legs. &quot; The Real Thing (or TRT for short) has been described as &quot;not quite early Brian Eno joins Led Zeppelin and Funkadelic. &quot; The video for &quot;Epic&quot;, which featured slow motion footage of a fish flopping out of water, received extensive airplay on MTV in the summer of 1990, despite provoking anger from animal rights activists. That same year, Faith No More gave memorable performances at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards (September 6) and on Saturday Night Live (December 1). Faith No More displayed a distinctly experimental bent on their next album, Angel Dust. One critic writes that the album is &quot;one of the more complex and simply confounding records ever released by a major label,&quot; and another writes that &quot;&#x27;A Small Victory&#x27;, which seems to run Madame Butterfly through Metallica and Nile Rodgers . . . reveals a developing facility for combining unlikely elements into startlingly original concoctions. &quot; Angel Dust featured the singles &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot; and &quot;A Small Victory&quot;, as well as a re-recording of the theme to the film Midnight Cowboy. Later pressings of the album also included their cover of the Commodores classic &quot;Easy&quot;, which in some parts of the world became the band&#x27;s biggest hit. Angel Dust, though not as successful as TRT in the U. S. , sold 700,000 copies there, and did manage to outsell TRT in many other world charts. In Germany, for example, the record was certified Gold for sales of more than 270,000 copies. Along with heavy airplay of &quot;Easy&quot; and &quot;Midlife Crisis&quot;, the album became a bit of a sleeper hit in the U. K. , South America, Europe and Australia. After touring to support Angel Dust in the summer of 1992, (including tours with Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses), longtime guitarist Jim Martin was fired (although he claims he quit) during the early stages of recording their follow-up, King for a Day&#8230; Fool for a Lifetime in 1995. He was replaced by Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance. However, when the subsequent world tour was about to begin, Spruance jumped ship, leaving the band to recruit their keyboard roadie Dean Menta to handle guitar duties. KFAD/FFAL remains the band&#x27;s most heavily criticised album, varying in styles and moods from heavy and slow to spasmodic and jazzy. KFAD/FFAL did however sell acceptably in the U. K. , Germany and Australia. In the U. S. the album failed to get any sort of attraction or following, slipping out of the charts quickly. Sales (about 1. 5 million) were below that of Angel Dust. The band accordingly decided to cut their world tour short by 4 months, deleted the singles &quot;Gentle Art Of Making Enemies&quot; and &quot;Take This Bottle&quot;, and released a 7 x 7-inch box set of singles that included the B-sides and some interviews between the songs. An automobile accident occurred while in Bearsville, New York for the recording of &quot;King For A Day. &quot; It&#x27;s been described as rather bad. Mike Patton, Mike Bordin and Trey Spruance were in it, Patton was driving. They lived&#8230;Patton doesn&#x27;t drive any more. Patton comments, &quot;Well we saw God. We had a really bad car accident. &#8230;We had to look at lot of things in the face&#8230;it was nice. &quot; Album of the Year was released in 1997 and featured yet another new guitarist, Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of Billy Gould. The album debuted much higher than expected in some countries, for example Germany (#2, later going gold) and Australia (#1, going platinum). In an additional 12 countries in Europe, it went either gold or platinum. In the U. S. the reaction was slow for the album; however, just as interest was picking up on their tours and album they called it a day. Singles &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot; and &quot;Last Cup Of Sorrow&quot; had minimal success. Electro-tinged ballad &quot;Stripsearch&quot; was released as a single in various countries (excluding the U. S. and U. K. ). &quot;She Loves Me Not&quot; was cancelled as a single which was a little indicator of their imminent break-up. On April 19th 1998, after 16 years as a band, Faith No More dissolved. Although the break-up went by with limited media attention, many rumors had surfaced as to the reason, some which included infighting, disagreement over the amount of side-projects (since the line-up had consistently changed), collective exhaustion of creative energy and even the band&#x27;s growing popularity, which had been attributed as a main influence for many nu-metal bands who would ascend to the mainstream at the end of the decade. Despite being extinct for some years, the band still manages to influence and inspire musicians worldwide. Patton went on to collaborate with John Zorn, and has been active with several other groups, including Tomahawk and Fantomas. Guitarist Jim Martin went on to collaborate with Anand Bhatt. Keyboardist Roddy Bottum formed Imperial Teen, whose sunny pop music seemed very different from Faith No More. Mike Bordin regularly performs as a member of Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band, as well as Black Sabbath and he was also a member of Korn for a tour when their drummer David Silvera had a problem with his wrist. Billy Gould is a member of Brujeria, as well as founder of Kool Arrow Records, and has also overseen the releases of various Faith No More compilations. Jim Martin also now has the 235th largest pumpkin ever measured, and has made guest appearances on various records, including Antipop by Primus, as well as having released a solo album titled Milk and Blood (1996). Faith No More also gained more publicity when their tracks &quot;Falling To Pieces&quot; and &quot;The Perfect Crime&quot; were featured in the films Black Hawk Down and Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Bogus Journey respectively. On the 25th of February 2009 Faith no More announced a reunion tour, to take place in 2009. The band are set to play a series of European festivals, according to a press release from frontman Mike Patton. The official press release for their reunion, written by Bill Gould, was released a day later and can be read on FNM. com . Th 10-song album Sol Invictus was released May 19, 2015. ", "Misfits": "Misfits are an American punk rock band formed in 1977 in Lodi, New Jersey. The band&#x27;s lyrical and graphical focus covers retro science-fiction, horror, and B-movies. Originally led by singer and songwriter Glenn Danzig until their initial breakup in 1983, the band was later resurrected in 1995 by Jerry Only without Danzig, and continues to exist. Danzig along with bassist Jerry Only (born Jerry Caiafa), who joined shortly after the band&#x27;s inception, remained the only consistent members throughout various line-ups, during the six years of the band&#x27;s original incarnation (from 1977 to 1983). Danzig was very interested in Marilyn Monroe, and took the band&#x27;s name from &quot;The Misfits&quot;, Monroe&#x27;s last film. The early Misfits were often quite melodic, featuring Danzig&#x27;s versatile singing, which had a style rooted in Italian tenors such as Mario Lanza and in 1950s doo wop. Early Misfits songs tended to have catchy, sing-along choruses backed by Danzig&#x27;s distorted keyboard accompaniments. The band began as a largely untrained ensemble. The song Last Caress (a very rare track for years) is now commonly regarded as the epitome of an early-Misfits song, with blaring instruments and Danzig&#x27;s melodic vocals finding a medium between Frank Sinatra and the Sex Pistols. By the original band&#x27;s last album, Earth A. D. , they had become a hardcore punk band, with Danzig&#x27;s standout vocal tone floating over a torrent of thrashing guitar, bass, and drums. Misfits&#x27; iconic skull graphic was lifted from the 1946 television serial, &#x27;The Crimson Ghost,&#x27; while the typeface is from the 1950s-&#x27;60s magazine, &#x27;Famous Monsters of Filmland. &#x27; It is useful to think of the early Misfits as a band of a couple of guys from New Jersey who were strongly attracted to punk due to the trends of the time, rather than as a traditional &#x27;punk band&#x27;. While Danzig lived with his mother in Lodi and was supported by her during the band&#x27;s early career, Jerry Caiafa and Doyle Caiafa helped finance the band by working long shifts at the family lumber yard, later founding a knife factory in rural Vernon Township (which often employed later members such as Robo, a citizen of Colombia). The Misfits seldom mixed with other New Jersey punk bands, creating their own small scene locally, while holding early acclaim in New York and expanding it nationally, in part thanks to mailing lists and other networking, including their once-small, later-considerable &#x27;Fiend Club&#x27; fan club. The original Misfits broke up in 1983, having released several 7&quot; singles and 12&quot; records, all of which were DIY limited-edition and most of which were hand-assembled by the band, that have long been considered prime collectors&#x27; items. Epigones from Lodi, New Jersey, include the bands Mourning Noise and Rosemary&#x27;s Babies, both of whom released records. The band often wore ghoulish makeup when performing, and bassist Jerry Only invented a hairstyle called the devilock which is still worn by fans today. The original Danzig-led Misfits broke up in 1983. In 1995, brothers and former members Jerry and Doyle reached an out of court settlement with Glenn Danzig, granting them the rights to perform as The Misfits. The new line-up included drummer Dr. Chud from Jerry and Doyle&#x27;s Christian Metal project, Kryst the Conqueror as well as new vocalist Michale Graves. This line-up released two studio albums, American Psycho (which used some recycled material from Kryst the Conqueror) and Famous Monsters as well as a live album and a rarities album. This incarnation ended when Dr. Chud and Michale Graves ultimately left the group in 2000, followed by Doyle&#x27;s departure in 2001. The current incarnation of the band is presently led by original member and bassist, Jerry Only (born Gerald Caiafa). Members of the touring group have included Marky Ramone (of the Ramones), and both drummer Robo and guitarist Dez Cadena of Black Flag fame. Jerry&#x27;s brother Doyle (formerly a guitarist for the Misfits) is currently estranged from the group and is working with a new group named Gorgeous Frankenstein (2005). Doyle recently reunited with Danzig to perform special sets of Misfits songs on Danzig&#x27;s 2005 tour. History: The Beginning In January of 1977, after singing in several garage bands that mostly played Black Sabbath songs, twenty one year old Glenn Danzig decided it was finally time to create something serious and original. As a tribute to Marilyn Monroe, he named his musical project after her final movie, The Misfits. For weeks, Glenn wrote songs and practiced with friends and old band mates, trying to find a suitable lineup of musicians to bring his vision to life. The first complete Misfits lineup consisted of Jimmy Battle on guitar, his old band mate Manny Martinez on drums, Diane DiPiaza on bass, and Danzig on electric piano and vocals. However, after only about a month of practicing, both Jimmy and Diane left the band. In need of new band mates, Manny suggested that his friend, Jerry Caiafa, should audition for bass. Jerry, a young football jock who had been voted most popular in his senior class at Lodi High School, had just received a bass guitar that Christmas and had only been practicing with it for two months. Despite Jerry&#x27;s fledgling bass talents, Glenn accepted him into the band and offered to teach him how to play. After three months of practicing, the trio headed into the studio to record their first single, entitled Cough/Cool. The single contained two keyboard driven art rock songs which were quite different from the music the Misfits would later become known for. The title track was somber and poetic, and very reminiscent of The Doors. The band released the single themselves through their own label, Blank Records. Over the next several months, Glenn, Manny, and Jerry (who had adopted the stage name Jerry Only) played a handful of gigs (their first two at CBGB in New York City) as they continued to practice and forge their own sound. Their experimental art rock style was met mostly with confusion. By October 1977, British punk bands such as The Damned and New York punk bands like The Ramones began to have an influence on The Misfits. They decided to take the band in a more punk direction by adding guitarist Franche Coma to the band and ditching the keyboards, allowing Danzig to engage in antics typical of a punk frontman. Their sound, as evinced on the album Static Age, was perhaps the most crisp, melodic, and powerful sound in punk at that time. They wouldn&#x27;t draw on B-movies for lyrical inspiration for at least another year, and at this point their lyrics instead portrayed a futuristic dystopia of television saturation, automation-like submissiveness, and glamorized sex and violence. As 1977 drew to a close, Glenn and Jerry decided that Manny was too unreliable and asked him to leave the band. He was replaced by Jim Catania, or &quot;Mr. Jim&quot;, who had played in a previous band with Glenn. At this time The Misfits caught their first big break. Mercury Records wanted to use the name Blank Records for a subdivision, but Glenn Danzig had a head for business and had secured a trademark on the name. They contacted Glenn and offered him thirty hours of free time in a professional studio, in exchange for full use of the Blank Records title. Glenn accepted the offer and in January of 1978, The Misfits headed into the New York studio to record their first full length album. Seventeen songs were recorded, featuring a unique combination of their early art rock material and the hard driving punk direction they had begun to adopt. Once the album was complete, the band shopped it around to various labels but no one was interested in releasing it. The album was shelved, and would remain unreleased in its entirety until 1995, when it was finally released as the Static Age CD. With no one interested in their album, The Misfits decided to take four tracks from it and release it themselves as an EP. In June 1978, the Bullet EP was released on their new label, Plan 9, which Danzig had named after the infamous Ed Wood movie Plan 9 From Outer Space . Rise to Popularity Around this time, both Glenn and Jerry decided they wanted to take the band in a more horror-themed direction. Glenn began to write more songs inspired by low grade horror and sci-fi movies, and both he and Jerry began to adopt ghoulish appearances, with Jerry applying dark makeup around his eyes and Glenn painting bone designs on his clothes. The band started to play more frequently and began to go on small tours in support of the Bullet EP. In October of 1978, during a small tour through Canada, Franche Coma decided he couldn&#x27;t handle touring and quit the band before the tour was even complete. Guitarist Rick Riley stepped in temporarily to fill out guitar duties for the rest of the tour. Mr. Jim wasn&#x27;t fond of the horror direction the band was heading in, and opted to leave the band once the tour was over. Within two months, Glenn and Jerry had recruited two new band members, drummer Joey Image, and guitarist Bobby Steele. Around this time, Jerry Only began to comb his hair in what would later become The Misfits signature hair style, which would later be dubbed the devilock. In December of 1978, after less than two months, the new Misfits lineup began playing shows together. Over the course of 1979, The Misfits further evolved the horror elements of their music and their imagery, effectively creating a new genre of music that would come to be known as horror punk. Glenn and Jerry adopted a skull mascot for the band from an old poster they&#x27;d come across for a 1946 serial called The Crimson Ghost . The Misfits released two more records on their Plan 9 label, the Horror Business EP and the Night of the Living Dead single, respectively. They began to establish a small but loyal fan base and decided to start their own fan club, which they called the Fiend Club. Glenn operated the Fiend Club from his mother&#x27;s basement, where he would print out t-shirts, assemble records, mail out merchandise catalogs, book gigs, and respond to fan mail, making the Misfits exemplary practitioners of the DIY ethic. As their popularity slowly began to increase, many people started to consider The Misfits to be the American equivalent of the British punk rock band, The Damned, whose singer, Dave Vanian, adopted the look of a classic vampire and sang in a brooding baritone. In June 26th, 1979, The Misfits opened for The Damned at a gig in New York City. Before the show, Jerry spoke with Dave Vanian about the possibility of The Misfits doing a tour of the UK in support of The Damned. In November of 1979, The Misfits flew over to England for their tour with The Damned. However, Dave Vanian had not taken Jerry serious and was surprised when Jerry showed up at his front door. Instead of turning The Misfits away, Dave tried his best to arrange for them to take part in the tour, but The Misfits weren&#x27;t happy with the situation. After playing only two gigs, The Misfits dropped off the tour. Their return flight back to America wasn&#x27;t until late in December, and so The Misfits were forced to kill time in England. Jerry spent some time with Sid Vicious&#x27; mother, who he had befriended after Sid&#x27;s death. On December 2nd, Glenn and Bobby went to see a show in London, where they were harassed by skinheads while standing in line. Glenn broke off a piece of glass and used it to fend off the skinheads while Bobby ran to get help. However, when the cops arrived, they arrested Bobby and Glenn, for what they described as &quot;threatening behavior&quot;. In an interview with Revolver Magazine in the October 2005 issue, Glenn went into greater detail about the event. He said the police found a knife in his possession and accused Glenn of being a &quot;ripper&quot; that had been stalking the area at the time. The police began to beat him, and Glenn fought back. He claims he did considerable damage to the police before they were finally able to subdue him. Glenn and Bobby then spent two nights jailed up in the London district of Brixton, during which time Glenn wrote the lyrics to the future Misfits song, London Dungeon. After the failed European tour, Joey Image decided to leave the band, and later formed the band The Mary Tyler Whores. Upon their return to America, The Misfits released the Beware EP through Plan 9 records and decided to take a short hiatus from the band in order to recover from their bad experience in England. After a four month break, Arthur Googy was recruited as the new drummer. Around this time, Jerry&#x27;s little brother, Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein, who was a huge fan of the band, started learning to play guitar with help from Glenn and Jerry. The Misfits began working on a full length album, which they planned to release through Plan 9. In August of 1980, they went into the studio and recorded twelve songs. Jerry began to persuade Glenn that Doyle would fit into the band much better than Bobby Steele. Doyle began to practice with the band and even entered the studio to record his own guitar tracks for the twelve songs they had recorded. Bobby has said that during this time period, Jerry would purposely neglect to inform him of practices, in order to make Bobby look bad. Jerry denies these accusations. Regardless, in October of 1980, shortly before the band&#x27;s annual Halloween show, Jerry informed Bobby that he was being replaced by Doyle, who was only sixteen at the time. Bobby Steele went on to form his own punk band a few months later, called The Undead. On Halloween of 1980, what many people consider to be the classic Misfits lineup, made its debut. After only playing a few shows with the new lineup, they took a six month break from the band. During this time, instead of releasing the entire album they had recorded, they selected three songs from it and released it as the 3 Hits From Hell EP (in 2002, Caroline Records had planned to finally releasing the entire album, which they called 12 Hits From Hell, however, the release was canceled at the last second at Jerry and Glenn&#x27;s request). Throughout the year of 1981, The Misfits continued to go into the studio to record tracks for a full length release, which they planned on calling Walk Among Us. Although they had planned on releasing the full length themselves through Plan 9, they got an unexpected offer from Slash Records to release the album. They accepted the offer and decided to rework the album before releasing it. On Halloween of 1981, The Misfits released the Halloween single through Plan 9, which consisted of two more tracks from the shelved full length they had recorded the previous summer. In 1981, Glenn wrote the song Archangel for The Damned vocalist Dave Vanian to sing with The Misfits backing him. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Dave never recorded vocals for the song and it was set aside until 1983, when Glenn decided to re-record it with his next band. In March of 1982, Ruby/Slash Records released Walk Among Us, the first full length Misfits album to be available to the public. &quot;Walk Among Us&quot; would later be considered by most fans to be the quintessential Misfits album, as well as one of the best punk albums of all time. The band began playing shows again after nearly a year. They started to become notorious for their intense stage presence and brutal live performances. Doyle was a sports jock like his brother, and shared his linebacker physique, which, coupled with their ghoulish appearance, made for quite intimidating axemen. Between the brothers, Glenn Danzig would bellow out his morbid lyrics while thrashing around on stage or crawling around on the floor, often throwing and receiving punches from the crowd. Despite Glenn&#x27;s smaller stature at 5&#x27;5&quot; or 5&#x27;6&quot;, he was fond of fighting, and enjoyed taunting the crowd, and instigating violence. Perhaps the most infamously violent Misfits show took place in San Francisco on April 10th, 1982. During the show some people in the crowd began to throw cans of beer at the stage. After Doyle was nearly hit in the head with a full beer can, he smashed his guitar over a crowd member&#x27;s head, instigating a full out riot. A couple days later, on April 15th, the band stopped at McDonald&#x27;s for food. Arthur Googy wanted to get two cheeseburgers, but Glenn told him they were too low on money and that he could only get one. Tensions started to rise, and the two came close to exchanging blows. Arthur quit the band and The Misfits had to cancel their plans to record their next EP, which they had planned on calling Earth A. D. . In need of a drummer, they offered the role to Doyle&#x27;s friend and classmate, Eerie Von, who had served as a photographer for The Misfits. Eerie reluctantly turned down the offer because he had already committed to drumming for the local band Rosemarie&#x27;s Babies. Black Flag vocalist, Henry Rollins, who had become great friends with The Misfits during their west coast gigs, informed ex-Black Flag drummer, Robo, that The Misfits were in need of a drummer. In July of 1982, Robo flew to the east coast and joined the band. Doyle graduated High School and began working full time at his father&#x27;s machine shop with Jerry. They used their earnings to purchase new instruments (because they tended to smash theirs on a weekly basis), and to fund The Misfits tours, recording sessions, and album pressings. While they provided funding for the band, Glenn would handle the Fiend Club and work on composing new songs. A common misconception is that Glenn only wrote lyrics and sang for The Misfits. Glenn was actually a multi-talented musician that would write the music and the lyrics himself, and would later teach them to his band mates at practice, where the songs would become totally fleshed out (Practices where usually held in Jerry&#x27;s garage, which they referred to as &quot;The Pit&quot;). Glenn was often irritated when people assumed he only sang for the band, and did not credit him as the band&#x27;s creative force. In order to remedy the situation in the future, Glenn considered naming his next band project either &quot;Glenn Danzig&quot; or simply &quot;Danzig&quot;. Decaying In September of 1982, The Misfits embarked on a large scale tour with their friends, Necros opening for them. During the tour, The Misfits stopped by a studio to record the instrumentals for the &quot;Earth A. D. &quot; EP while Glenn slept. On October 17, the band was arrested in New Orleans on the charges of grave-robbing while in search of the burial place of voodoo practitioner Marie Laveau. The Misfits denied the charges, and a witness reportedly attested that they had not even entered the cemetery gates. The band bailed themselves out of jail and skipped court to drive to their next performance in Florida. Upon returning from the tour, The Misfits released an album of live material called Evilive. During this time Glenn was becoming increasingly unsatisfied with The Misfits. He thought his band mate&#x27;s musicianship was not sophisticated enough to bring his musical visions to life, and thought they were wasting money by constantly destroying their instruments. He also wasn&#x27;t happy with the thrashy speed punk direction the Earth A. D. EP had taken. He began to write songs for a new band project, which he considered calling &quot;Danzig&quot;, but instead choose to name Samhain, after the ancient Celtic holiday which influenced the modern Halloween celebration. In July of 1983, The Misfits went into the studio to finish working on Earth A. D. They decided to record and add two of their new songs to the album, making it closer to full length status. In order to make it a proper full length album, Glenn decided to record two of the songs he had intended for Samhain: Bloodfeast, and Death Comes Ripping. The resulting album was Earth A. D. /Wolfs Blood, a gritty, thrashy album of hardcore punk rock, which none of the members were quite satisfied with. In August, after a series of arguments with Glenn, Robo decided to leave the band. Glenn became further disenchanted with The Misfits and began to audition musicians for his new band project. On October 29th, 1983, The Misfits played their yearly Halloween show in Detroit, Michigan. Glenn had selected Brian Damage to be the new Misfits drummer. However, Brian got drunk before the show and continuously messed up the songs. After several songs Doyle escorted Brian off the stage and the drummer for the Necros filled in for the rest of the set. The band members were visibly upset with each other and Glenn informed the audience that it would be the last Misfits show ever. The next day the band members drove back home without saying a word to each other and went about their respective lives. Legal Battle After the demise of The Misfits, Glenn Danzig focused on his new band project, Samhain, which was much darker and occult oriented than The Misfits. Meanwhile, Jerry Only and his brother Doyle moved to Vernon, NJ, where they went to work full time in their father&#x27;s machine parts factory. During this time, Jerry became more focused on his family and his baby daughter, Kathy. He became more serious about his Christian faith, and regretted some of the things he took part in during his time with The Misfits. He watched as Glenn continued to grow in popularity with Samhain, a band that Jerry viewed as evil and Satanic. In 1987, Jerry decided to start a new band, one that would oppose the &quot;dark path&quot; chosen by Glenn. Together with Doyle, Jerry (who changed his stage name to Mo the Great) started writing songs for a Christian heavy metal band with barbarian imagery, called Kryst The Conqueror. They then created the &quot;Doyle Fan Club&quot; to help spread the word about their new band. During the writing and recording process for the album, they tweaked their instruments, in an attempt to design the ultimate bass and guitar. Once the music was recorded, they hired studio vocalist Jeff Scott Soto (who had done vocals for Yngwie Malmsteen) to record vocals for the album. Jeff was forced to remain anonymous due to contractual obligations. To hide his identity, he was credited on the album as Kryst. Despite Jerry&#x27;s efforts, Kryst the Conqueror failed to gain a following. The album was never fully released and the band never played a single show. By 1987, The Misfits&#x27; reputation had grown to nearly legendary status, and Glenn&#x27;s band Samhain (later renamed to &quot;Danzig&quot;), was signed to a major label. The Misfits back catalog had been re-issued and was selling extremely well. Around this time, Jerry Only contacted Glenn about getting a cut of the Misfits royalties, beginning a legal battle that lasted several years. Jerry concedes that Danzig wrote nearly all the lyrics and most of the music, but he contended that he and Doyle &quot;wrote 25% or maybe 30% of the music,&quot; and deserved compensation. Danzig, on the other hand, insisted that all songs were written by him and that the other Misfits&#x27; creative input was minimal at best. In late 1988, Danzig&#x27;s new group (also called &quot;Danzig&quot;) released their debut album on longtime fan Rick Rubin&#x27;s record label. Five years later, Glenn broke into the mainstream when the live video for the Danzig song, Mother, became a hit on MTV, introducing thousands of new fans to Danzig&#x27;s back catalog with Samhain and The Misfits. Around this time, many older punk bands began to do reunion tours, earning often hefty paychecks in the process. Jerry and Doyle approached Glenn about the possibility of a Misfits reunion tour, but Glenn turned them down by having security escort them off the property. Jerry decided to cease his pursuit of song credit, and instead tried to reach an out of court settlement that would allow him to use The Misfits name and image. In 1995, Jerry and Glenn were finally able to settle out of court. Jerry gained the rights to record and perform as the Misfits, although he shared joint merchandising rights with Glenn. The Resurrected Misfits Jerry and Doyle reformed The Misfits immediately, recruiting Michale Graves on vocals and Dr. Chud of Sardonica on drums. The new incarnation of the Misfits released two full-length albums, American Psycho and Famous Monsters as well as a collection of rare and unreleased &quot;resurrected&quot; Misfits tracks, until Michale Graves and Dr. Chud left the band on October 25, 2000 at a performance at the House of Blues in Orlando. Doyle then took an indefinite hiatus from performing. Jerry took over lead vocals in addition to his bass duties, and recruited punk veterans Dez Cadena of Black Flag, and Marky Ramone of The Ramones to undertake a Misfits 25th Anniversary Tour, which lasted about three years, intermittently. Freed from the Misfits&#x27; contractual obligations to Universal&#x27;s Geffen and Roadrunner imprints, Jerry Only and his brother John Cafiero formed Misfits Records and launched their new label with two releases, the American debut of Balzac (a Japanese horror punk band strongly influenced by The Misfits and Samhain), and a new Misfits album featuring the band&#x27;s retakes on ten 1950&#x27;s rock classics, Project 1950. The album featured not only the punk rock all-star Misfits lineup of Only, Cadena and Ramone, but prominent appearances from 60&#x27;s pop chanteuse Ronnie Spector and Blondie keyboardist Jimmy Destri. Meanwhile Michale Graves and Dr. Chud had formed their own band, Graves, which released a single album before breaking up. In 2004, Michale Graves sang in Gotham Road. Currently, Graves is fronting his own solo project, Michale Graves, while Dr. Chud is fronting for his own band called Dr. Chud&#x27;s X-Ward. On February 28th, March 1st and March 2nd 2005, Glenn Danzig performed a half hour worth of classic Misfits tracks, in the middle of his Danzig set. Joining him on guitar was none other than Doyle. It was the first time the two have performed together in 20 years, and the first time Doyle has taken to the stage since he went on hiatus. These shows have prompted rumors of a reunification of Jerry, Doyle and Glenn, although Danzig has repeatedly made public statements shooting down such rumors. Glenn and Doyle plan on performing more shows together, and Glenn has stated that this is as close as anyone will ever get to seeing a true Misfits reunion. Recently, Marky Ramone has left The Misfits 25 lineup, and the new lineup contains none other than Robo, formerly of the Glenn Danzig days of the Misfits, and originally of seminal hardcore punk band Black Flag. A full European tour has been booked with this new lineup, and some select dates in the U. S. have been announced. Sadly, the UK leg of the tour had to be canceled due to a problem with Robo&#x27;s visa, and, as a result, the band could not play the City Invasion 2005 tour. A rescheduled United Kingdom tour followed in September. The Misfits and their Japanese counterparts, Balzac, staged a show at Tony Bennett&#x27;s studio complex in Englewood, N. J. , for a possible future live CD and/or DVD release on Misfits Records. Original Misfits guitarist Franche Coma made a guest appearance to perform three songs from the Static Age LP. Meanwhile, Doyle returned to play with Danzig for the Blackest of the Black Tour in the fall of 2005. Glenn claimed that this will be his final tour (which was not the case), though he says he will continue to make music. He is currently slated as the producer for Doyle&#x27;s upcoming band, Gorgeous Frankenstein, which currently lacks a singer or a vocalist, but will feature Argyle Goolsby on bass. The Misfits are currently writing material for a new studio album which they will begin recording after a brief tour of Central and South America. The tour begins January 26th and will go through February 6th. The album will apparently feature Dez Cadena on guitar and Eric &quot;Goat&quot; Arce, who replaced Robo in 2010, on drums. They have yet to say whether Dez will contribute to songwriting and singing. Legacy The influence The Misfits have had on punk rock, and rock music in general, sometimes seems disproportionate to the publicity and critical attention they have received. Myriad bands have imitated The Misfits&#x27; style, such as Blitzkid and Calabrese,these bands have become known as horror punk. Psychobilly has various similarities with horror punk. A number of bands have recently surfaced which, although in some cases less obviously horror punk, are still strongly visibly and audibly influenced by The Misfits. These include, most notably, bands such as AFI, Tiger Army, Alkaline Trio, Cradle of Filth, Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Avenged Sevenfold, Wednesday 13 and the Murderdolls. Many musical groups whose resemblance to The Misfits seems far removed also cite the band as crucial influences, such as Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses. Other bands who hold The Misfits in high regard are Slayer, Pantera, NOFX and more recently, Slipknot. Many local New Jersey hardcore, punk, and emo bands, such as My Chemical Romance and The Banner, cite The Misfits as a main influence. Winnipeg born Breakcore artist Venetian Snares considers the Misfits a huge influence, inspired by the subtle, but frequent use of 3/4 time. The Misfits&#x27; far reaching influence can also be evident in the vast number of fans from all different facets of the music world that follow the band. Obviously wildly popular band among punk rock fans, the band has also received much exposure to the heavy metal community from Metallica&#x27;s numerous Misfits cover songs. Misfits fans themselves can often be easily discerned, as many completely immerse themselves in the band&#x27;s imagery. At underground shows, and especially at Halloween, it is not uncommon to see many punks and metal heads dressed in black with Crimson Ghost face paint and the devilock hairstyle. Black leather jackets, over sized leather boots, as well as gloves and bodysuits printed with the skeletal structure are also common. Current members include:  * Jerry Only (Gerald Caiafa) - bass guitar, backing vocals (1977-1983, 1995-present), lead vocals (2001-present)  * Dez Cadena - guitar, backing vocals (2001-present)  * Eric &quot;Goat&quot; Arce - drums (2010-present) Discography (&quot;Original&quot; Misfits) Cough/Cool (1977) - single Bullet (1978) - EP Horror Business (1979) - EP Night of the Living Dead (1979) - single Beware (1980) - EP 3 Hits From Hell (1981) - EP Who Killed Marilyn?

The band members are Romy Madley Croft (vocals, lead guitar), Oliver Sim (vocals, bass guitar), and Jamie Smith, known as Jamie xx (beats, MPC sampler). Second guitarist and keyboardist Baria Qureshi was dropped from the band mid-tour in 2009. The reasons behind her ousting remain unclear. On 17 August 2009, the group released their debut album xx on Young Turks label. The album was recorded in a small garage and produced by the band. It garnered critical acclaim and has been generally well-received, scoring an average of 86/100 based on 24 professional reviews. Also it ranked on &quot;best of the year&quot; lists with Rolling Stone placing it at #9 and NME placing it at #2. Four singles were released from their debut album: &quot;Crystalised&quot;, &quot;Basic Space&quot;, &quot;Islands&quot; and &quot;VCR&quot;. The xx also remixed the classic song &quot;You&#x27;ve Got The Love&quot; originally written by The Source and covered by Florence + the Machine. They also added their own vocals on the song. The group won the 2010 Mercury Prize for their album on 7th September 2010. After being the bookies&#x27; favourites for many of the weeks leading up to the announcement, they beat eleven other acts. &quot;Angels&quot; was the first single from The xx's second album, Coexist. It was released on July 16 2012. A second track from the album, &quot;Chained&quot;, was released on line prior to the official Coexist launch on 11 September. In June 2014, it was revealed in an interview with Dazed that the xx were working on their third studio album, with producer Rodaidh McDonald at the Marfa Recording Company studio in Marfa, Texas. The album is said to have a &quot;completely different concept&quot; to the band&#x27;s first two studio albums. http://thexx. info", "The Pogues": "The Pogues is a Celtic punk band from London, formed in 1982 and fronted by Shane MacGowan. The band reached international prominence in the 1980s and early 1990s. MacGowan left the band in 1991 due to drinking problems but the band continued first with Joe Strummer and then with Spider Stacy on vocals before breaking up in 1996. The band, including MacGowan, reformed in 2001 and has been playing regularly ever since. While the band has not released an album since 1996, they are credited with inventing Celtic Punk and have had a large influence on the larger Celtic Fusion scene. The band was awarded the life-time achievement award at the annual Meteor Ireland Music Awards in February 2006. The Pogues were founded in King&#x27;s Cross, a district in north London, in 1982 as Pogue Mahone - &quot;pogue mahone&quot; being the Anglicisation of the Irish pog mo thoin, meaning &quot;kiss my arse&quot;. The band specialised in Irish folk music, often playing with the energy of the punk rock scene from which several of the members had their roots. Their politically-tinged music was reminiscent of The Clash, with whom they played (Joe Strummer produced one of their albums and even joined the group briefly), and used traditional Irish instruments such as the tin whistle, banjo, cittern, mandolin, accordion, and more. In the later incarnations of the band, after the departure of Shane MacGowan, electronic instruments such as the electric guitar would become more prominent. The first of The Pogues&#x27; albums, Red Roses for Me , borrows much from the punk tradition of MacGowan&#x27;s previous band The Nipple Erectors (later dubbed The Nips). Band history Shane MacGowan (vocals), James Fearnley (accordion) and Spider Stacy (tin whistle) were the original members of the Pogues, in the days when they busked on the streets of London. Before the rest of the group formed, MacGowan and Stacy were rumoured to have played impromptu performances on street corners and city buses which attracted local interest to their talent. They later added Jeremy &#x27;Jem&#x27; Finer (guitar, banjo), Cait O&#x27;Riordan (bass) and Andrew Ranken (drums). The band rapidly developed a reputation, started releasing independent work, and ended up opening for The Clash on tour in 1984. Shortening their name to &quot;The Pogues&quot; due to lack of radio play for the curse in their name, they released their first album Red Roses for Me that October. Phil Chevron (guitar) joined the group soon after, then with the aid of punk and new wave forefather Elvis Costello they recorded the follow up, Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash, in 1985 (The album title is a famous comment attributed, probably falsely, to Winston Churchill and others in describing the traditions of the British Royal Navy). The album cover featured The Raft of the Medusa, though the faces on the characters in Gericault&#x27;s painting have been replaced with those of the band members. While the first album had featured a higher percentage of traditional songs, Shane MacGowan came into his own as a songwriter with this disc, offering up poetic story-telling, such as &quot;The Sick Bed of Cuchulainn&quot; and &quot;The Old Main Drag,&quot; as well as definitive interpretations of Ewan MacColl&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Old Town&quot; and Eric Bogle&#x27;s &quot;And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda,&quot; the latter of which has become more popular than the original recording. The band failed to take advantage of the momentum created by the strong artistic and commercial success of their second album. They first refused to record another album (offering up the 4 track EP Poguetry in Motion instead); O&#x27;Riordan married Costello and left the band, to be replaced by bassist Darryl Hunt; and they added a multi-instrumentalist in Terry Woods, formerly of Steeleye Span. Looming over the band at this period (as throughout their entire career) was the increasingly erratic behaviour of their vocalist, principal songwriter and creative visionary, Shane MacGowan. Success &amp; breakup The band remained stable enough to record If I Should Fall from Grace with God in 1988 (with its Christmas hit duet with Kirsty MacColl &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot;) and 1989&#x27;s Peace and Love. The band was at the peak of its commercial success, with both albums making the top 5 in the UK (nos. 3 and 5 respectively), but MacGowan was spiralling out of control. Following their next album, Hell&#x27;s Ditch, MacGowan and the band parted company in 1991. With his departure, the band was thrown into a state of flux. Without their singer, vocal duties were for a time handled by Joe Strummer, before Stacy finally took over permanently. Two politely received albums followed, the first of which, Waiting for Herb, contained the band&#x27;s third and final top twenty single, &quot;Tuesday Morning&quot; which became their best selling single internationally. In 1996, the Pogues disbanded with just three members remaining. Post breakup Shane MacGowan founded Shane MacGowan and The Popes in 1994. They recorded two studio albums in the period up to their split in 2002. MacGowan&#x27;s autobiography, A Drink With Shane MacGowan , co-written with his journalist girlfriend Victoria Mary Clarke, appeared in 2001. During this time the three other long-term members of the Pogues (Spider Stacy, Andrew Ranken and Darryl Hunt) played together briefly as the Vendettas. Reunion The band, including MacGowan, re-formed for a Christmas tour in 2001 and performed 9 shows in the UK in December . In 2002 Q magazine named The Pogues as one of the &quot;50 Bands To See Before You Die&quot;. Also in December 2004, VH1 Conducted a poll to find the best Christmas song ever, with &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; coming number one with 2,650 of the 10,000 votes cast - over 25%. In early 2005, VH1 conducted another poll to find the 100 greatest number ones that never Were, With The Pogues coming in at number 27. In July 2005, the band - again including MacGowan - played at the annual Guilfest festival in Guildford before flying out to Japan where they played three dates. Japan is the last place they all played together before MacGowan was originally sacked in 1991, and they have a strong following there. They played a date in Spain in early September. The reunited Pogues played dates in the UK with support from the Dropkick Murphys in late 2005, and re-released their 1987 Christmas classic &quot;Fairytale Of New York&quot; on 19th December, which went straight in at #3 in the UK Singles charts on Christmas Day 2005, showing the song&#x27;s enduring popularity. On December 22nd 2005 the BBC broadcast a live performance (recorded the previous week) on the Jonathan Ross Christmas show with Katie Melua. &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; was voted the greatest Christmas Record of all time for the second year running in a poll by UK Music Channel VH1, with &quot;Fairytale of New York&quot; taking in a whopping 39% of the overall vote. The band was awarded the life-time achievement award at the annual Meteor Ireland Music Awards in February 2006. In March 2011, the Pogues played a six-city/ten-show sell-out US tour titled &quot;A Parting Glass with The Pogues&quot;. In August 2012, The Pogues undertook a 30th Anniversary European Tour.

Since the band's formation, they have consisted of Bono (real name Paul Hewson) (vocals, guitar, harmonica), The Edge (real name David Evans) (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Adam Clayton (bass) and Larry Mullen, Jr. (drums, percussion). The band is the biggest selling alternative rock act of all time, having sold 150 million albums worldwide as of 2008. They have won 22 Grammys and were inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. As of 2009, they have released 12 albums and 58 singles. Foundation: The band originally formed in 1976 when Larry Mullen posted a bulletin in his school asking for musicians to form a rock band. The band then consisted of the four current members plus three additional guitarists, including The Edge's brother Dick Evans (later a member of Virgin Prunes), Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin. According to legend, Bono originally auditioned as a guitarist but couldn't play. He auditioned as lead vocals, but really couldn't sing. He was, however, incredibly enthusiastic about the band, extremely charismatic, a great writer, and was strangely able to reach the audience when the band played, something he is known for still today. Bono will reach out into the crowd and dance or mess with someone in the crowd at every concert. He was kept as a member. The extra guitarists would soon leave the band and the group would go through the names \"Feedback \" and \"The Hype\" before finally settling on U2. The 70s &amp; 80s: 1978 was a jumping point year for the band, finally finding their sound / voice. U2 won a talent contest in 1978: PS500 and funds to make a record. Paul McGuinness became the band's manager and U2 released an EP called Three and the single Another Day, the following year. U2 went on to release their first album, Boy and then more critically acclaimed albums incl. : October, War, Under A Blood Red Sky, and The Unforgettable Fire (featuring the song PlayMLK dedicated to Martin Luther King Jr). Seen by many as a political band with more charisma than others, they were called \"a different kind\" of band. After a short break U2 returned with The Joshua Tree &amp; the USA music inspired Rattle And Hum (also a movie of the same name, based on the tour). The 90s: Promising \"to dream it all up again\", they added industrial and dance styles to their music. Trying to drop a goody two shoes image, they went to Berlin (Germany), supposedly to develop new self-expressions. From there they started to make fun of themselves and had a good time of it in albums like Achtung Baby (meaning \"watch out, baby\", artwork feat. make-up artist Nassim Khalifa) &amp; Zooropa. Bono took on many stage personae such as \"The Fly\", \"Mirrorball Man\" and \"Mr. MacPhisto\" for the gigantic ZOO TV Tour. Later they continued to make fun of Pop culture and all its extremes with the album Pop and consequent PopMart tour which was announced to be launched at a Kmart store and included a giant golden arch across the stage. The 00s: At the end of the 90's into 00's U2 became less image and more reality. With the death of Bono's good friend Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS, Bono wrote more songs from the heart surrounding ideas like life and death, children, hope, and the real world past all the pop culture and TV. Some say they've returned to a more band-centric sound with albums like All That You Can't Leave Behind which features a song, Kite, dedicated to Bono's father who passed away shortly after the album's conception and 2004's How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. The 10s: U2 went on the U2 360deg Tour in 2009 and 2010. This tour set records for the highest-grossing concert tour. The group is currently working on an upcoming album produced by Danger Mouse. The Name: There are many theories as to the origin of the name U2. For example, U2 was an intelligence airplane that was in use by the United States during the Cold War. Other obvious candidates include \"You too\" and \"You two\", etc. Nonetheless the official line on the name's origins remains unknown. The band has been quoted as saying that they did think of the U2 spy plane, but remain hushed about other reasons. . .

The music video for &quot;Ice Cream Cake&quot; was released on March 15. ", "Stevie Wonder": "Stevie Wonder is a stage name of Stevland Hardaway Morris (b. Stevland Hardaway Judkins , 13 May 1950 in Saginaw, MI, USA - aka Little Stevie Wonder ), a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, record producer and activist. He debuted, as Little Stevie Wonder , with the single &quot; I Call It Pretty Music, But the Old People Call It the Blues &quot; (1961, Tamla Motown) and his latest album is &quot; A Time 2 Love &quot; (Oct 2005, Motown) Stevland he lost his sight shortly after birth and, when four, his mother left his father and moved, with the children, to Detroit. She changed her name back to Lula Hardaway and later changed her son&#x27;s surname to Morris - partly, because of relatives - which has remained Stevie Wonder &#x27;s legal name, ever since. Wonder signed with Motown&#x27;s Tamla label at the age of eleven, and continues to perform and record for Motown to this day. To date, he has recorded more than thirty U. S. top ten hits and received twenty-two Grammy Awards, the most ever awarded to a male solo artist. In 2008, Billboard magazine placed Wonder fifth in their list of the Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists. He has recorded several critically acclaimed albums and hit singles, and writes and produces songs for many of his labelmates and outside artists. A multi-instrumentalist, Wonder plays the drums, guitar, synthesisers, congas, and most famously the piano, harmonica, and keyboards. Wonder forged his divergent styles into a trademark sound, putting his musical signature on a quartet of albums that would change music forever: 1972&#x27;s Talking Book , 1973&#x27;s Innervisions , 1974&#x27;s Fullfillingness&#x27; First Finale , and 1976&#x27;s Songs in the Key of Life . By the end of the decade, Wonder had won a record fifteen Grammys, as well as numerous other awards. In the following decades he wrote, among other classics, his 1982 collaboration with Paul McCartney, &quot;Ebony and Ivory&quot;, which remained number one for seven weeks in a row. 1984&#x27;s The Woman in Red soundtrack produced the enduring classic &quot;I Just Called to Say I Love You&quot;, yet another number-one hit that gained him an Academy Award. In 1989 Wonder was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside The Rolling Stones. His contribution to worldwide social and political change is just as impressive; he championed the effort to make Martin Luther King&#x27;s birthday a national holiday, as well as becoming a driving force behind 1985&#x27;s USA for Africa campaign. ", "Petite Noir": "After dabbling in metal and chillwave growing up, 24-year-old Cape Town, South Africa artist Yannick Ilunga is now making dramatic, hypnotic pop as Petite Noir. Two years after his debut single as Petite Noir, \"Till We Ghosts\", dropped, Ilunga is heading to London to work on his debut album for Domino in the coming months. This deliberate pace makes sense given his ever-evolving sensibilities, and its allowed him to gather a host of enviable opportunities like opening for Solange in 2013 and even having musical hero Yasiin Bey, aka Mos Def, jump on a remix of &quot;Ghosts&quot;. Clearly, Ilunga is on his own schedule, his own path. So far, it's working. ", "Foxes": "Louisa Rose Allen (born 29 April 1989), better known by her stage name Foxes, is a British singer and songwriter originally from Southampton and now based in London. She is best known for her featured vocals on Zedd&#x27;s song &quot;Clarity&quot;, which peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and at number one of the US Hot Dance Club Songs, and &quot;Let Go for Tonight&quot; which entered the UK Singles Chart at number seven on 8 March 2014. On 26 January 2014, she won her first Grammy Award, winning Best Dance Recording at the 56th Grammy Awards for &quot;Clarity&quot;. On her website, Allen explained the origin of her stage name. Allen&#x27;s mother had described a \"haunting and beautiful\" dream in which foxes ran down their street, howling. Allen, who had been attempting to find a suitable stage name, settled on &quot;Foxes&quot;. She found the name fitting because it reflected her music: she had titled her first song \"Like Foxes Do&quot; and many of her subsequent songs were about animals. She considered training to be a beauty therapist in her hometown of Southampton but moved to London when she was 18, following her sister and brother, and attended music college. She began doing gigs as &quot;Foxes&quot; in London, UK in 2011. Allen rose to fame when she was featured in Zedd&#x27;s &quot;Clarity&quot;. It charted in numerous countries, including debuting within the top ten at eight in Billboard Hot 100. The song reached Double Platinum in Australia, Platinum in the U. S. and Canada, Gold in New Zealand. She has released a single and an EP, Warrior, as &#x27;Foxes&#x27;, working with Sam Dixon. Both tracks from debut single &quot;Youth&quot; were featured in Gossip Girl. She also worked with Fall Out Boy on the song &quot;Just One Yesterday&quot; and its music video. &quot;Youth&quot; (including remixes from Danny Howard, Breakage, Le Youth, Nate Goldsmith and Maze &amp; Masters) has so far garnered millions combined SoundCloud and YouTube plays between them. Another single, &quot;Beauty Queen&quot;, was released on 13 May 2013. She was signed to RCA, who re-released her single &quot;Youth&quot; on 21 August 2013,with a remix EP being released on 27 October 2013. Foxes is working on her debut album to be released at the beginning of 2014 by RCA. She says the album has a &quot;dark streak. . . as well as a pop element that runs through it. &quot; On 31 October, Foxes revealed the name of her debut album to be Glorious. On 4 November, she unveiled the album cover along with the tracklist through Instagram, including 11 tracks on the standard version and 16 on the deluxe version. A brand new recorded version of &quot;Let Go for Tonight&quot; was released on 23 February 2014, charting in the UK at number seven and becoming her most successful single to date. After some time, Foxes released the single: &quot;Holding Onto Heaven&quot; on 17 December which was available as a free download from iTunes for Christmas. The album&#x27;s release date is expected to be on 12 May 2014. Foxes is also featured on Fall Out Boy&#x27;s song &quot;Just One Yesterday&quot; from their new album Save Rock and Roll. ", "The Flaming Lips": "The Flaming Lips are an American neo-psychedelic band, formed in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, United States in 1983. Throughout their career, band members have come and gone, but currently The Flaming Lips consist of original members Wayne Coyne (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards) and Michael Ivins (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), along with members Steven Drozd (drums, guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), and Derek Brown (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). Former members include Mark Coyne (lead vocals), Richard English (drums, keyboards, backing vocals), Nathan Roberts (drums), Jonathan Donahue (guitar, backing vocals), who went on to form Mercury Rev, Ronald Jones (guitar, backing vocals), and Kliph Scurlock (drums). The Flaming Lips are known for their lush, multi-layered arrangements, spacey lyrics and bizarre song titles. They are also acclaimed for their elaborate live shows, which typically feature animal suits, puppets, streamers, video projections and complex stage light configurations. In 2002, Q magazine named The Flaming Lips one of the &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;. In 2006, Oklahoma City named a street Flaming Lips Alley in their honor. The group recorded several albums and EPs for Restless Records in the 1980s and early 1990s. After signing to Warner Brothers, they scored a #9 hit on the Billboard Alternative charts (and #55 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 chart) in 1994 with &quot;She Don&#x27;t Use Jelly&quot;. Although it would be their only hit single, the band has maintained critical respect and, to a lesser extent, commercial viability with sonically majestic albums such as 1995&#x27;s Clouds Taste Metallic , 1999&#x27;s The Soft Bulletin , 2002&#x27;s Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots and 2006&#x27;s At War with the Mystics . The Flaming Lips&#x27; 12th studio album, Embryonic , was released in October of 2009. A complete cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s The Dark Side of the Moon was released in May 2010. The Flaming Lips and Heady Fwends , their collaborative album which features artists like Ke$ha, Bon Iver, Nick Cave and Erykah Badu, was released on Record Store Day, April 2012. Their next studio album, tentatively titled The Terror , will be released in January 2013. Their song &quot;Do You Realize??&quot; is the official State Rock Song of Oklahoma. www. flaminglips. com", "M.I.A.": "There are five known artists under this name: (1) Mathangi \"Maya\" Arulpragasam, (born 18 July 1975 in Hounslow, London, U. K. ) is a British artist of Sri Lankan descent. As a baby she moved with her family to their native Sri Lanka, where her father became increasingly politically active in militant activities. As the Civil War escalated the rest of the family was forced to flee as refugees, first to India and then the UK. \"M. I. A. \" references both her London neighborhood (Acton) and her politically tumultuous youth. Her style contains elements of hip-hop, reggae, alternative, dance hall, electro and baile funk and is strongly inspired by her Sri Lankan background. (2) American Punk/Hardcore band formed in Orange County, CA in 1981 by Chris Moon, drums; Mike Conley, bass; Nick Adams, guitar (all previously of Las Vegas, NV punk band The Swell); and Art Carasco, vocals. Their sound was generally hardcore and thrasher, though they produced more melodic and progressive sounds in their later albums. Allmusic called the band &quot;one of the 50 best So-Cal punk bands of the great early-&#x27;80s second wave explosion. In 1984 they signed a deal with the cult Alternative Tentacles label, after the label&#x27;s founder, Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra, saw them play at a secret illegal punk nightclub in Las Vegas. Biafra was impressed by Mike Conley&#x27;s distinctive voice, saying &quot;The minute you hear a song with him singing you know it&#x27;s him. &quot; They released the album Murder in a Foreign Place on Alternative Tentacles in 1984, followed in 1985 by Notes From the Underground on National Trust Records, and in 1987 by After the Fact on Flipside Records. The band split up in 1988. In 2001, Alternative Tentacles released Lost Boys, a 37-song retrospective of the band&#x27;s work, including Last Rites, Murder in a Foreign Place, and several additional tracks. On February 28, 2008 vocalist Mike Conley was found dead in a Chicago hotel parking lot. Conley was taken to Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in Melrose Park, where he was pronounced dead at 6:25 a. m. On April 27, 2008, there was a secret warm-up show at Detroit Bar featuring Todd Sampson of Self Abuse and Samson&#x27;s Army on vocals, Jello Biafra of Dead Kennedys on guest vocals, Chris Moon and Larry Pearson on drums, Nick Adams on guitar, and Bob Thomson on bass. The next day, the &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; benefit show took place at the Anaheim House of Blues with Jigsaw, Naked Soul, Cadillac Tramps, Social Distortion and MIA with the same lineup as the previous night, but adding Kevin Seconds of 7 Seconds on guest vocals. The proceeds of &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; went to Mike Conley&#x27;s family. (3) Formed in the mid 70s, Independent Musicians Associated (MIA) was a group of musicians, technicians and drawers gathered together by Lito and Liliana Vitale's parents. They produced their own records and concerts in an independent way. Their music is a complex symphonic rock with definite Argentinean/latin folk influence with multiple chorals and vocals beautifully contrasting with the keyboards and a great guitar sound upon a strong rhythmic section. They were highly influenced by symphonic music, more noteworthy by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Gentle Giant and Focus.

", "The Velvet Underground": "The Velvet Underground was a pioneering experimental rock band from New York City first active from 1965 to 1973. Its best-known lineup consisted of vocalist/guitarist Lou Reed, bassist/violist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison and drummer Maureen Tucker. The band also collaborated with Nico for their debut album in 1967, under the supervision of producer and pop artist Andy Warhol. Some see The Velvet Underground as being a bridge between the pacifist themes of the late 60s and the sheer chaos and indifference of the mid-70s punk movement. The Velvet Underground was one of the first rock music groups to experiment heavily with the form by incorporating avant-garde influences. The group&#x27;s often raw, sometimes difficult sound would influence many later punk, noise rock, and alternative music performers, and singer Lou Reed&#x27;s lyrics brought new levels of social realism and sleaze to rock. Critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins argue that &quot;The Velvet Underground marked a turning point in rock history. After the release of The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico knowing the power of which it was capable, the music could never be as innocent, as unselfconscious as before. &quot; Pre-history (1964-1965) The foundations for what would become The Velvet Underground were laid in late 1964. Lou Reed had performed with a few short-lived garage bands and had worked as a songwriter for Pickwick Records, a job Reed described as &quot;a poor man&#x27;s Carole King&quot;. Reed met John Cale, a Welshman who had moved to the United States to study classical music. Cale had worked with John Cage and La Monte Young, but was also interested in rock music. (Young&#x27;s use of extended drones would be a profound influence on the early Velvet&#x27;s sound). The pair rehearsed and performed together, and their partnership and shared interests steered the early direction of what would become the Velvet Underground. Reed&#x27;s first group with Cale was the short-lived The Primitives, assembled to support a Reed-penned single, &quot;The Ostrich&quot;. Reed and Cale recruited Sterling Morrison - a college classmate of Reed&#x27;s who had already played with him a few times - to play guitar, and Angus MacLise to play percussion. This quartet was first called The Warlocks, then The Falling Spikes. While moving into his New York City apartment Reed found the book The Velvet Underground by Michael Leigh, a book about sadomasochism , left by previous tenant Tony Conrad . Reed and Morrison have reported the group liked the name, considering it evocative of &quot;underground cinema,&quot; and fitting, due to Reed&#x27;s already having written &quot;Venus In Furs&quot;, inspired by Leopold von Sacher-Masoch &#x27;s book of the same name, also dealing with sadomasochism. The band immediately and unanimously adopted the book&#x27;s title for its new name. Early stages (1965-1966) The newly named Velvet Underground rehearsed and performed in New York City. Their music was generally much more relaxed than it would later become: Cale described this era as reminiscent of beatnik poetry, with MacLise playing gentle &quot;pitter and patter rhythms behind the drone&quot;. In July of 1965, Reed, Cale and Morrison recorded a demo tape. When he briefly returned to Britain, Cale gave a copy of the tape to Marianne Faithfull, hoping she&#x27;d pass it on to Mick Jagger. Nothing ever came of the demo. The demo was eventually released on the 1995 box set Peel Slowly and See . When the group accepted an offer of $75 for their first paying performance at Summit High School, in Summit, NJ, MacLise left the group, protesting what he considered a sell out. &quot;Angus was in it for art&quot; , Morrison reported. MacLise was replaced by Maureen Tucker, Jim Tucker&#x27;s younger sister. Tucker&#x27;s abbreviated drum kit was rather unusual: She generally played on tom toms and an upturned bass drum, using mallets rather than drumsticks, and she rarely used cymbals. The band having asked her to &#x27;do something unusual&#x27;, she turned her bass drum on its side, and played standing up. When her drums were stolen from one club, she replaced them with garbage cans, brought in from outside. Her driving rhythms were at once simple yet exotic, influenced by Babatunde Olatunji and Bo Diddley records, and became an essential part of the group&#x27;s music. The group earned a regular paying gig at a club, and gained an early reputation as a promising ensemble. While the American west coast was undergoing the Summer of Love , psychedelia and flower power , the typically east coast Velvets concerned themselves with darker subject matter: transvestites, heroin addiction, and sadomasochism. Also setting them apart from their contemporaries was their use of feedback and amplifier noise in a musical context, exemplified by the seventeen minute track &quot;Sister Ray&quot; from their White Light/White Heat album. Andy Warhol and the Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable (1966-1967) Andy Warhol became the band&#x27;s manager in 1965, and suggested they feature the German-born singer Nico on several songs. Warhol&#x27;s reputation certainly helped the band gain a higher profile. Though Reed eventually fired Warhol, he praised the integrity of his early efforts with the group. Warhol helped the band land a coveted recording contract with MGM&#x27;s Verve Records, with himself as nominal &#x27;producer&#x27;, and gave the Velvets unprecedented free reign over the sound they created. During their stay with Andy Warhol, the band became part of his multimedia roadshow Exploding. Plastic. Inevitable. , for which they provided the musical part. This show played a couple of months in New York City, then took to the road all over the United States and Canada until its last installment in May 1967. In 1966, MacLise temporarily rejoined the Velvet Underground for a few E. P. I. shows when Reed was suffering from hepatitis and unable to perform. For these appearances, Cale sang and played organ and Tucker switched to bass guitar. Also at these appearances, the band often played an extended jam they had dubbed &quot; The Booker T &quot;, after the leader of the musical group Booker T &amp; the MG&#x27;s; the jam later became the music for &quot;The Gift&quot; on White Light/White Heat . Some of these performances have been released as a bootleg; they remain the only recordings of MacLise with the Velvet Underground. The Velvet Underground and Nico (1967) At Warhol&#x27;s insistence, Nico sang with the Velvet Underground on four songs off their debut album, The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico . The album was recorded in one or two days -- there is some uncertainty between the band members&#x27; memories -- at TT&amp;G Studios during the November of 1966, and released by MGM Records in March of 1967. The album cover was famous for its simple, suggestive Warhol design: a bright yellow banana with &quot;Peel Slowly and See&quot; printed near a perforated tab. Those who did remove the banana skin found a pink, phallic, peeled banana beneath. This would later be used as the cover to their boxed set, appropriately titled &quot; Peel Slowly and See ,&quot; released in 1995. Eleven songs showcased their stylistic range, veering from the pounding attacks of &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting For The Man&quot; and &quot;Run Run Run,&quot; the droning &quot;Venus In Furs&quot; and &quot;Heroin&quot; to the quiet &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; and the tender &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;. The overall sound was propelled by Reed&#x27;s strong deadpan vocals, Cale&#x27;s droning or shrieking viola, Morrison&#x27;s often rhythm and blues or country-influenced guitar, and Tucker&#x27;s hypnotically simple but steady, propulsive beat. The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico peaked at number 171 on Billboard Magazine&#x27;s top 200 charts, but the promising debut was dampened somewhat by legal complications: The album&#x27;s back cover featured a still from a Warhol motion picture, Chelsea Girls . The film&#x27;s cinematographer, Eric Emerson, had been arrested for drug possession and, desperate for money, claimed the still had been included on the album without his permission. MGM Records pulled all copies of the album until the legal problems were settled (by which time the record had lost its modest commercial momentum), and the still was airbrushed out. White Light/White Heat (1968) The Velvet Underground performed live often, and their performances became louder, harsher and often featured extended improvisations. Cale reports that at about this time, The Velvet Underground were one of the first groups to receive an endorsement from Vox . The company pioneered a number of special effects, which the Velvet Underground utilized on White Light/White Heat . Reed fired Warhol as manager, and Nico was jettisoned, partly due to her unreliability. In September 1967, the VU recorded what would become their second album, White Light/White Heat , with Tom Wilson as producer. It was released January 1968. The recording was raw and oversaturated, one of the harshest, loudest records yet released. Cale has stated that while the debut had some moments of fragility and beauty, White Light/White Heat was &quot;consciously anti-beauty&quot; . Isler and Robbins suggest that the record &quot;is almost unbearably intense. &quot; The title track and first song starts things off with Reed pounding on piano like a demented Jerry Lee Lewis. The eerie, hallucinatory &quot;Lady Godiva&#x27;s Operation&quot; remains Reed&#x27;s favorite track on the album. Despite the dominance of noisefests like &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, and &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot;, there was room for the darkly comic &quot;The Gift&quot;, a Reed-penned short story narrated in Cale&#x27;s deadpan Welsh accent. The meditative &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; was later covered by Galaxie 500, Cabaret Voltaire, and Nirvana. In 1968, a year after Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band and Are You Experienced , there was an experimental feeling throughout rock music, while it should be noted that the Velvets are arguably the foremost pioneers in this realm. There were a few other experimenters with noise, but few were tackling noise with as much apparent glee as the V. U. White Light/White Heat was hugely important, and &quot;Sister Ray&quot; is arguably one of the most significant rock songs of the late 1960s. The songs&#x27; simple 3-chord progression along with screeching organ and lead guitar, all distorted perhaps beyond the bounds of tastefulness, coupled with William Burroughs -influenced lyrics, was completely unique. &quot;Sister Ray&quot; is often seen as one of the earliest precursors of punk and Alternative rock, with its blistering instrumentation and alarming lyrics. The second album&#x27;s cover was a subtle black-on-black picture of the tattooed arm of Billy Name, one of Warhol&#x27;s &quot; Factory &quot; members. White Light/White Heat entered the Billboard top 200 chart for 2 weeks, at number 199. Tensions were growing: the group was tired of receiving little recognition for their hard work, and Reed and Cale were pulling the Velvet Underground in different directions. The differences showed in the last recording session the band had with John Cale in February 1968: two pop-like songs in Reed&#x27;s direction (&quot;Temptation Inside Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Stephanie Says&quot;), and a viola-driven drone in Cale&#x27;s direction (&quot;Hey Mr Rain&quot;). None of these songs were released until they were included on the VU and Another View compilation albums. The Velvet Underground (1969) Before work on their third album started, Reed fired Cale, and replaced him with Doug Yule. The Velvet Underground was recorded in late 1968, and released in March of 1969. It&#x27;s often been reported that the early edition of the Velvet Underground was a struggle between Reed and Cale&#x27;s creative impulses: Reed&#x27;s rather conventional approach contrasted with Cale&#x27;s experimentalist tendencies. The Velvet Underground would seem to prove the truth of these claims, as the harsh, abrasive tendencies on the first two records were almost entirely absent. This resulted in a gentler sound influenced by folk music, prescient of the songwriting style that would form Reed&#x27;s solo career (another factor in the change of sound was the band&#x27;s amplifiers being stolen from an airport while they were on tour; they obtained replacements by signing a new endorsement deal with Sunn ). Morrison&#x27;s ringing guitar parts and Yule&#x27;s melodic bass guitar and harmony vocals are featured prominently on the album. Reed&#x27;s songs and singing are subdued and confessional, and he shared lead vocals with Yule, particularly when his own voice would fail under stress. A rare Maureen Tucker vocal is featured on &quot;After Hours,&quot; a song that Reed said was so innocent and pure he couldn&#x27;t possibly sing it himself. The album&#x27;s influence can be heard in many later indie rock and lo-fi recordings. A year on the road and the &quot;lost&quot; fourth album (1969) The Velvet Underground spent much of 1969 on the road, feeling they were not accepted in their hometown of New York City and not making much headway commercially. During the same year, the band recorded on and off in the studio, creating a lot of material that was never officially released due to disputes with their record label. What many consider the prime of these sessions was released many years later as VU . This album has a transitional sound between the whisper-soft third album and the pop-rock anthems of their final record, Loaded . The rest of the recordings, as well as some alternate takes, were bundled on Another View . After Reed&#x27;s departure, he later reworked a number of these songs for his solo records (&quot;Stephanie Says&quot;, &quot;Ocean&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand It&quot;, &quot;Lisa Says&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s My Best Friend&quot;). Indeed, most of Reed&#x27;s early solo career&#x27;s more successful hits were reworked Velvet Underground tracks, released for the first time in their original version on VU , Another View , and later on Peel Slowly and See . The standout from VU is considered by many to be &quot;One of These Days,&quot; part torch song and part slide-guitar freakout. Loaded (1970) In 1969, MGM Records president Mike Curb wanted to purge any drug- or hippie-related bands from MGM, and the V. U. were on his list, along with Frank Zappa&#x27;s Mothers of Invention. (Nonetheless, MGM insisted on keeping the tapes of their unissued recordings. ) Atlantic Records signed the Velvet Underground for what would be its final studio album, Loaded , released on Atlantic&#x27;s subsidiary label Cotillion. The album&#x27;s title refers to Atlantic&#x27;s request that the band produce an album &quot; loaded with hits. &quot; Though the record was not the smash hit the company had anticipated, it contains the most accessible pop the V. U. had performed, and several of Reed&#x27;s best-known songs, including &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. Though Tucker had temporarily retired from the group due to her pregnancy, she received a performance credit on Loaded . Drums were actually played by several people, including Yule, engineer Adrian Barber, session musician Tommy Castanaro, and Doug Yule&#x27;s brother Billy, who was still in high school. Disillusioned with the lack of progress the band was making and pressured by manager Sesnick, Reed decided to quit the band and did so in August 1970. The band essentially broke while recording the album, and Reed walked off before it was finished. Doug Yule finished the album, singing parts to some of Reed&#x27;s vocal tracks. Lou Reed has often said he was completely surprised months later when he saw Loaded in stores. He also said, bitterly, &quot;I left them to their album full of hits that I made. &quot; Reed was particularly bitter about the truncation of a verse from &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;. &quot;New Age&quot; was changed as well: as originally recorded, its closing line ( &quot;It&#x27;s the beginning of a new age&quot; ) was repeated many more times. A brief interlude in &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; was also removed. (Years later, the album would be reissued with the edits restored. ) On the other hand, Yule has pointed that the album was to all intents and purposes finished when Reed left the band and that Reed had been aware of most if not all of the edits. The few weeks between Reed&#x27;s departure in late August and Loaded 's arrival in the shops in September of the same year also would have left little room for the whole process of editing, reviewing, mastering and pressing. 1970 onwards Although Loaded &#x27;s spin-off single &quot;Who Loves the Sun&quot; did nothing, the album itself is something of a muted triumph. &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; became U. S. radio favorites, and the band, featuring Walter Powers III on bass, and Doug Yule promoted to lead vocals and guitar, went on the road once more, playing the East Coast of the U. S. and Europe. By that time, however, Sterling Morrison had obtained a B. A. degree in English, and left the group for an academic career with the University of Texas at Austin. His replacement was singer/keyboard player Willie Alexander. The band played shows in England, Wales, and the Netherlands, some of which are collected on the 2001 box set Final V. U. (Longtime fans began mocking the new lineup as the &quot;Velveteen Underground&quot;, perhaps unfairly. ) In 1972 Atlantic released Live at Max&#x27;s Kansas City , a live bootleg of one of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s final performances with Reed, recorded by fan Brigid Polk. By this time Doug Yule was once again touring the United Kingdom, this time backed with hired hands as Sesnick had sent home Tucker, Powers and Alexander, effectively ending their time with the band. Later that year, Sesnick managed to secure a recording contract with Polydor Records in England, and Yule recorded Squeeze under the Velvet Underground name with Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice. Squeeze is a controversial item among Velvet fans, most of whom flatly decline to consider any post-Lou Reed material as worthwhile. Rarely heard before the advent of Internet audio file sharing, the album&#x27;s perceived Middle of the road content is sometimes dismissed out of hand by Velvets fans. Although the album technically is a Velvet Underground release, it is properly Doug Yule&#x27;s debut solo album and it might have fared far better if it had been labeled as such, given the actual quality of most of the tracks, some of which would not have been out of place on Loaded . (Interestingly, Yule was actually in the group longer than Cale. ) Post-VU developments (1973-1990) Reed and Cale, in the meantime, developed solo careers. Sterling Morrison was a professor for some time, teaching Medieval Literature at the University of Texas at Austin, then became a tugboat captain for several years. Maureen Tucker raised a family before returning to small-scale gigging and recording in the 1980s; Morrison was in a number of touring bands, among others with Tucker&#x27;s band. In 1988, erstwhile singer Nico died of a brain hemorrhage while bicycling on the island of Ibiza. Reunions (1990 and 1992-1994) In 1990, Reed and Cale released Songs for Drella , dedicated to the recently deceased Andy Warhol. (&quot;Drella&quot; was a nickname Warhol had adopted, a combination of &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot;. ) Though Morrison and Tucker had each worked with Reed and Cale since the V. U. broke up, Songs for Drella was the first time the mercurial pair had worked together in decades, and rumors of a reunion began to circulate, fueled by the one-off appearance by Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison and Maureen Tucker to play &quot;Heroin&quot; as the encore to a brief Songs for Drella set in Jouy-en-Josas, France. The same lineup briefly reunited from 1992-1994, resulting in a European tour -- both headlining and opening a few concerts for U2 -- and a live album, Live MCMXCIII . Cale sang most of the songs Nico had performed with the group. Before the band could tour the U. S. or record -- an MTV Unplugged album was proposed -- Cale and Reed fell out again, breaking up the band once more. The definitive end to the band&#x27;s checkered career came when Sterling Morrison died of cancer in 1995. ", "Sigur Ros": "Sigur Ros are an Icelandic post-rock band. The name is derived from the name of lead vocalist Jonsi Birgisson&#x27;s little sister, Sigurros. They hail from the same creative and vibrant Icelandic music scene as mum and Amiina. They released their first ever foray into film-making with their tour documentary, Heima in late 2007. Jon Thor Birgisson (Jonsi), Georg Holm, and Agust AEvar Gunnarsson formed the group in Reykjavik, Iceland in August 1994. They soon won a record deal with a local record label, Smekkleysa (Bad Taste). In 1997, they released Von (Hope) and in 1998, released a remix collection named Von brigdi . The name is Icelandic wordplay: Vonbrigdi means &quot;disappointment,&quot; but Von brigdi means &quot;hope alteration. &quot; (In English, the album is sometimes known by the alternative name &quot;Recycle Bin. &quot;) International acclaim came with 1999&#x27;s Agaetis Byrjun (&quot;An alright start&quot;), for which the band were joined by Kjartan Sveinsson. The album&#x27;s reputation slowly spread by word of mouth over the next two years. Soon, many critics worldwide hailed it as one of the best albums of its time and the band was playing with Radiohead and other big names. Drummer Agust left the band after the recording of Agaetis Byrjun and was replaced by Orri Pall Dyrason. After the release of Agaetis Byrjun , the band became perhaps most well known for Birgisson&#x27;s signature style of playing guitar with the bow from a cello, accentuated with reverb, creating a sweeping, fluid sound that is unique for an electric guitar. In early 2001, Sigur Ros set out to record some songs in their newly-completed alafoss swimming pool studio with their friend Steindor Andersen who is a fisherman and chairman of the Icelandic poetry society, Idunn. Steindor is a chanter/singer of the traditional Icelandic epic poetry form, called &quot;rimur,&quot; for which the band named their next EP, Rimur . Only 1000 copies of the EP were printed and sold in the spring tour of 2001. In 2002, their highly anticipated follow-up album ( ) was released. Upon release all tracks on the album were untitled, though the band later published song names on their website. Famously, all of the lyrics on ( ) are sung in vonlenska (&quot;Hopelandic&quot;), nonsensical vocalisations which resemble the sound of the Icelandic language. It has also been said that the listener is supposed to interpret their own meanings of the lyrics, which can then be written in the blank pages in the album booklet. In October of 2003, Sigur Ros joined Radiohead in composing music for Merce Cunningham&#x27;s dance piece Split Sides ; Sigur Ros's three tracks were named &quot;Ba Ba,&quot; &quot;Ti Ki,&quot; and &quot;Di Do&quot; and released in March of 2004 on an EP titled Ba Ba Ti Ki Di Do The three songs are separate tracks, but the band intended that all three be played at the same time to form one single song. The band&#x27;s 1997 debut album Von also finally found a United States and United Kingdom release in October of 2004. Their latest full-length album, Takk&#8230; (Thanks&#8230;), was released on September 13, 2005, with a free legal download of their first single, &quot;Glosoli,&quot; made available on August 15. For North American fans, &quot;Saeglopur&quot; was made available for download on August 16. &quot;Hoppipolla,&quot; the second official single from Takk&#8230; , was released on November 28 alongside a new studio remake of &quot;Hafsol,&quot; a song which was previously released on the band&#x27;s 1997 debut, Von . Saeglopur EP was released on July 10th in most parts of the world and on August 8th in the United States. Its original release date was May 8th, but because of the sudden demand of &quot;Hoppipolla,&quot; especially in the UK due to its inclusion on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Planet Earth,&quot; it was pushed back from that date. Sigur Ros recorded three new songs for the EP: &quot;Refur,&quot; &quot;Ofridur,&quot; and &quot;Kafari. &quot; The Hvarf/Heim double album was released on November 5, 2007. Hvarf contains reworkings of songs dating back to the bands&#x27; first album, whereas Heim contains live acoustic versions of more well known songs. The double album was an accompaniment to the film Heima . Heima is a documentary showing footage of the band&#x27;s tour of Iceland, including live footage and interviews. The official web site is www. heimafilm. com . Sigur Ros has sold over 2. 5 million albums worldwide. On June 23, 2008, they released Med sud i eyrum vid spilum endalaust . The single &quot;Gobbledigook&quot; was available for a free download on their website. In January 2010, the band began a hiatus, and they are now working on new material. On August 11, 2011, the band&#x27;s website showed a trailer for a project called Inni . A week later, the project was revealed to be a new live album and DVD, although the release date is currently unknown. Sigur Ros&#x27;&#x27; sixth studio album, Valtari , was released on May 29, 2012 on Parlophone. In January 2013, Kjartan Sveinsson left the band and was not replaced. Sigur Ros&#x27;s first album following his departure was titled Kveikur and released in June 2013. In 2014, the band made a guest appearance in the HBO show &#x27;Game of Thrones&#x27;, performing The Rains of Castamere in the 2nd episode of the 4th season.

", "Mutemath": "Mutemath is an alternative rock band which formed in New Orleans, LA, United States in 2003. They consist of Paul Meany (vocals, Rhodes, keytar, keyboards, samples), Roy Mitchell-Cardenas (bass, percussion), Darren King (drums, samples), and Todd Gummerman (guitar, keyboards, backing vocals). Since Mutemath released its first EP in late 2004 and hit the road in 2005, their musical style has transformed over the years. By the time of their 2006 self-titled debut, their blending of adverse genres earned them a reputation as one of modern music's most daring young groups. By 2007, they found themselves Grammy nominated and declared by Alternative Press as \"the #1 band you need to see live before you die. \" But in the band almost broke up during the making of their sophomore album Armistice . \"It was a risk we had to take,\" says King looking back on what they set out to accomplish for Armistice . \"This record was by far the most painful music-making experience I've ever had, but also the one I'm most proud of. \" The band is best known for the 2007 single \"Typical\", taken from their 2006 self titled album. The song's innovative backwards video was nominated for a Grammy in 2008 for Best Short Form Music Video. Speaking with Songfacts in a 2011 interview, Darren King poked fun at the somewhat futile nomination : &quot;For the rest of our career, we get to say &quot;Grammy nominated band. &quot; We don&#x27;t have to say what it was for. (Laughing). &quot; Mutemath re-enacted the &quot;Typical&quot; video during a live performance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , using the same reverse playback technique used in the original video. The song also peaked at #33 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The band has contributed songs to various films such as Twilight , Transformers , Never Back Down , The Stepfather , The Rocker , and Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 . Alongside contributing songs to film and product endorsements, Mutemath has appeared on every major late night television program including: The Tonight Show with Jay Leno , The Late Show with David Letterman , Late Night with Conan O'Brien , Jimmy Kimmel Live! , and The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson . In April 2011, it was announced on their official website that founding guitarist Greg Hill had left the band in October 2010. The new album was recorded with other band members filling in on guitar and a new guitarist, Todd Gummerman, was named shortly after Odd Soul was released and he features in most music videos from the album. ", "Orbital": "Orbital are an electronic music duo consisting of brothers Phil Hartnoll and Paul Hartnoll formed in Sevenoaks, Kent, England whose career originally lasted from 1989 until 2004. Orbital reformed in 2009 with the original lineup of Phil Hartnoll and Paul Hartnoll. In 2014 they split up again. Orbital took their name from Greater London&#x27;s orbital motorway, the M25, which was central to the early rave scene and party network in the South East during the early days of acid house. One of the biggest names in British electronica during the 1990s, Orbital were both critically and commercially successful, being particularly known for an element of live improvisation during their shows, a rarity with techno acts. They were initially influenced by early electro and punk rock. In 1989, Orbital recorded a track called &quot;Chime&quot; on their father&#x27;s cassette deck. It was released on Oh Zone Records in December 1989, and re-released on FFRR a few months later. The track became a rave anthem, reaching number 17 in the UK charts, and earning them an appearance on Top of the Pops, during which they wore anti-Poll Tax t-shirts. A few singles and EPs followed, and their first self-titled album, a collection of tracks recorded at various times, was released in late 1991. In late 1992, the &quot;Radiccio&quot; EP barely reached the UK top 40, but it included probably their most well-known song, &quot;Halcyon&quot;. The song featured a backwards sample of Kirsty Hawkshaw from Opus III&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s a Fine Day&quot;, and B-side &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; was similarly based on a line from Scott Walker&#x27;s rendition of Jacques Brel&#x27;s song &quot;Next&quot;. Halcyon was dedicated to the Hartnolls&#x27; mother, who was addicted to the tranquiliser Halcion for many years. The duo&#x27;s popularity grew rapidly with the release of their second album, titled &quot;Orbital 2&quot; in 1993. The album featured complex arrangements and textures, and opens with the two minute track &quot;Time Becomes&quot;, which comprises nothing more than 2 slightly detuned, looped samples of a Michael Dorn line from Star Trek: The Next Generation, &quot;&#8230;where time becomes a loop&quot; being played simultaneously through the left and right channels, respectively (until 1 cycle of phase difference has happened). This very same sample was used at the beginning of &quot;The Mobius&quot;, the opening track in the previous album. This audible pun was intended to make listeners believe that they had bought a mis-pressed album (Orbital 1 packaged in Orbital 2). The album reached #28 on the UK album charts, staying in the top chart for fifteen weeks. Halcyon was remixed for the album, as &quot;Halcyon + On + On&quot;. The version played live has also gained notoriety amongst fans for containing a complete mashup of diverse samples including &quot;You give love a bad name&quot; by the band &quot;Bon Jovi&quot;, &quot;Heaven is a place on Earth&quot; by Belinda Carlisle, and most recently &quot;I believe in a thing called love&quot; by the band &quot;The Darkness&quot;. The first two albums are commonly known as the &quot;Green Album&quot; and the &quot;Brown Album&quot;, after the colour of their covers. Orbital won a NME award for &quot;Vibes Best Dance Act&quot; early in 1994, but it was their headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 25 June 1994 that brought them most attention. Q magazine classed it as one of the top 50 gigs of all time, and in 2002 included Orbital in their list of &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;. Orbital gave an improvisational element to live electronic music as the brothers mixed and sequenced their tracks on the fly, wearing their trademark head-mounted torches behind banks of equipment. Orbital were one of the few electronic acts invited to play at Woodstock &#x27;94. The third album &quot;Snivilisation&quot; was released in August 1994. Alison Goldfrapp provided vocals on a couple of the tracks, including the single &quot;Are We Here?&quot;. This track also included a sample from &quot;Man at C&amp;A&quot; by &quot;The Specials&quot;. Among the remixes of Are We Here? was &quot;Criminal Justice Bill?&quot; - four minutes of silence, a reference to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which was in part intended to clamp down on the rave scene which had given birth to Orbital. The other track with Goldfrapp vocals, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, was remixed for the &quot;Times Fly&quot; EP, the band&#x27;s only release in 1995. The single &quot;The Box&quot; was released in April 1996, reaching #11 in the UK, and its parent album &quot;In Sides&quot;, released in May 1996, became their second top five album. It revealed a less obviously dance-oriented sound than previously, and had more in common with soundtrack music. In Sides has since come to be considered one of their most critically well-regarded works. As with the previous album, there was a vague theme of ecological disaster and dissatisfaction with society. The following year, the duo contributed to film soundtracks (The Saint &amp; Event Horizon) and enjoyed the biggest singles of their career, with a live version of Satan and their reworking of the aforementioned &quot;The Saint&quot; theme both reaching #3 in the UK. 1998 saw a return to the studio to work on their fifth album &quot;The Middle of Nowhere&quot;. This was released in 1999, becoming their third top five album, and was a return to a more upbeat style, with Alison Goldfrapp returning on vocals, and included the single &quot;Style&quot; featuring the stylophone. In 2000 the single Beached was released from the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Beach&quot;, mixing the brothers&#x27; musical style with a melody by Angelo Badalamenti and the words of Leonardo DiCaprio from the film. 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Altogether&quot; featured guest vocals by the Hartnolls&#x27; brother-in-law David Gray, a sampled Ian Dury, and a version of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme, entitled &quot;Doctor ?&quot;. It was to be their last album for FFRR, and had a mixed critical reception. The following year, &quot;Work 1989-2002&quot; collected various singles from Chime onwards. Orbital split up in 2004. They played a final series of gigs from June through July 2004 at the &quot;Glastonbury Festival&quot;, the &quot;T in the Park&quot; Festival in Scotland, the &quot;Oxegen&quot; festival (formerly known as &quot;Witness&quot;) in Ireland, and the &quot;Wire Festival&quot; in Japan, concluding with a live &quot;Peel Session&quot; gig at Maida Vale Studios in London on 28 July 2004. The release of their seventh and last original album, the &quot;Blue Album&quot; (which, unlike the untitled previous green and brown albums, was actually named the &quot;Blue Album&quot;), coincided with this final wave of shows. The album featured &quot;Sparks&quot; (on &quot;Acid Pants&quot;) and Lisa Gerrard (on the final single &quot;One Perfect Sunrise&quot;). Paul Hartnoll continues to record music under his own name, including tracks for the new &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; game for the PSP. He released his first full length solo album, entitled &quot;The Ideal Condition&quot; on the ACP record label in June 2007. Phil Hartnoll formed a new electronica duo, &quot;Long Range&quot;, with Nick Smith. Their debut album, &quot;Madness and Me&quot;, was released on their own label, Long Range Recordings, on August 6. In 2008 as &quot;Long Range&quot;, they signed to commercial management company Angel Artists who additionally represent the likes of Dave Ball (of &quot;Soft Cell&quot;), &quot;The Grid&quot;, Paul Dakeyne &amp; &quot;Icehouse Project&quot;. He lives in Brighton with his three sons, Louis, Milo and Conrad. Orbital released a 2 CD/DVD compilation &quot;Orbital: Live at Glastonbury 1994-2004&quot; on 11 June 2007. The collection contains over 2 hours of music recorded from the group&#x27;s performances at the festival over the course of a decade of appearances there. Orbital sometimes incorporated political and environmental commentary into their music. The track &quot;Forever&quot; on Snivilisation samples a speech by Graham Crowden from the 1982 Lindsay Anderson film Britannia Hospital, in which he lambasts humankind for its destructive ways; and the track &quot;You Lot&quot; on the Blue Album, features a confrontational, partially vocoded anti-genetic engineering sample from Christopher Eccleston, originally from the TV two-part series The Second Coming written by Russell T Davies. They recorded &quot;The Girl With The Sun In Her Head&quot; from &quot;In Sides&quot; using Greenpeace&#x27;s mobile solar power generator CYRUS. They named an early record &quot;Belfast&quot; after playing live in the city of Belfast at the height of The Troubles in 1990. Other album track titles suggest environmental concern such as &quot;Kein Trink Wasser&quot; (&quot;no drinking water&quot; in German) from Snivilisaton and &quot;Dwr Budr&quot; (&quot;dirty water&quot; in Welsh) and &quot;P. E. T. R. O. L. &quot; from &quot;In Sides&quot;. Although Orbital has done many live shows, Phil Hartnoll said in an interview , that he only learned to DJ in the last few years. LRR is the music label of Phil Hartnoll (Orbital) and Nick Smith and home to the band, Long Range. www. longrange. tv and www. myspace. com/longrangemusic Pioneer of British electronic music returns Orbital (aka Phil and Paul Hartnoll) were, for almost two decades, one of the most creative and influential electronic acts on the planet, recording their seventh and last studio album in 2004. Not content to rest on the laurels of past glory, Phil Hartnoll's new creative project is Long Range, formed in conjunction with Nick Smith, an artist whose recording career for dance labels Dragonfly and Atomic Records has led to major film credits with Ridley Scott. Long Range's sound harks back to the ambient genius that was Orbital whilst transporting the listener into a more acoustic, atmospheric and cinematic realm. From blissed out moments to jarred and broken beats, their eponymous album references a spectrum of genres and refuses to be pigeonholed. Orbital website: www. loopz. co. uk", "Jim O'Rourke": "American indie rock and avant-garde musician, composer and producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke (born January 18, 1969, in Chicago) has been a key component in the increasing overlap of the American and European experimental music avant-garde, working in everything from jazz and rock to ambient and electro-acoustic and building many a bridge in between. He currently resides in Tokyo, Japan. A Chicago native, O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s work has found equal luck with experimental jazz and noise fanatics, chill room denizens, and bedroom experimentalists, and has had the resultant effect of cross-pollinating many otherwise isolated compositional communities. In early 1993, he formed an avant-rock group with Darin Gray and Dylan Posa called Brise-Glace. The band released one studio album, When in Vanitas&#8230;, in 1994. Subsequently, O&#x27;Rourke has released a fair bit of material as a soloist, although more often in the electro-acoustic/musique concrete vein. Dealing most often with prepared guitar in improvisational group settings, he&#x27;s collaborated with such contemporary improv heroes as Derek Bailey, Henry Kaiser, Eddie Prevost and Keith Rowe (of English improv group AMM), KK Null, David Jackman (Organum), and early Krautrock experimentalists Faust. O&#x27;Rourke is also engaged in an ongoing exploration of experimental rock as a member of Gastr del Sol, who&#x27;ve released albums through the Teen Beat and Table of the Elements labels. Beginning with guitar at the age of 6, it wasn&#x27;t until his collegiate career at DePaul University that O&#x27;Rourke&#x27;s interest in the less obvious possibilities of the instrument led him through the early catalogs of the post-classical and electro-acoustic traditions. While at DePaul, O&#x27;Rourke completed much of the work that would constitute his first few releases. He also had the opportunity to meet up with noted improvisational guitarist Derek Bailey, whose invitation to O&#x27;Rourke to play at the British improv festival Company Week led to further collaborative projects with Bailey, Henry Kaiser, Eddie Prevost, and David Jackman. O&#x27;Rourke began working with Dan Burke&#x27;s Illusion of Safety project in the early &#x27;90s, releasing three albums through Staalplaat and Tesco, before moving on to form experimental &quot;rock&quot; group Gastr Del Sol with David Grubbs. Although focusing more on collaboration after a string of solo releases in the early &#x27;90s, O&#x27;Rourke has shifted back to solo work of late, releasing Terminal Pharmacy through John Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik label and completing commissioned pieces for the Kronos Quartet and the Rova Saxophone Quartet. In 1995, O&#x27;Rourke was invited by German experimental electronic label Mille Plateaux (Oval, Steel, Microstoria) to conduct an extended remix of their entire back catalog. He also produced and co-wrote a good portion of innovative German outfit Faust&#x27;s Table of the Elements release, Rien. O&#x27;Rourke is also noted for his work as a producer. This role led to another project during the mixing of Wilco&#x27;s Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, when O&#x27;Rourke combined with Jeff Tweedy and Glenn Kotche to form Loose Fur. ", "EXO-K": "EXO (Korean: egso) is a ten member South Korean-Chinese boy group under SM Entertainment, formed in 2012. EXO-K consists of Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D. O. , Kai and Sehun. EXO-M consists of Xiu Min, Lay, Chen and Tao. EXO is divided into two subgroups, EXO-K and EXO-M, promoting in South Korea and China separately. Their prologue (promotional) single &quot;What Is Love&quot; was released on January 30, 2012. Their second single &quot;HISTORY&quot; was released on March 8th 2012. On April 8th 2012, the group released their third single &quot;MAMA&quot;, before releasing their debut E. P &quot;MAMA&quot; the next day. All three singles were included in the E. P. On May 15th, 2013, it was confirmed by SM Entertainment that EXO would be making a comeback with their first full-length album, entitled &quot;XOXO&quot;. The album is set to be released on June 3, 2013, in two editions; a &quot;Hug&quot; edition (EXO-M; Chinese) and a &quot;Kiss&quot; edition (EXO-K; Korean). On 1 April 2014, SM Entertainment announced that EXO will be having a comeback on April 15. The company then began to reveal individual teaser photos. The title track of the upcoming album will be called &quot;jungdog (Overdose)&quot;. The group released their second full-length album, entitled &quot;Exodus&quot; on March 30, 2015. The release of the album was accompanied by the title track &quot;Call Me Baby&quot;. ", "Sia": "Sia Kate Isobelle Furler (born 18 December 1975) or simply Sia, is an Australian pop, downtempo, and jazz singer and songwriter. In 2000, her single, &quot;Taken for Granted&quot; was a top 10 hit in the United Kingdom. Her 2008 album, Some People Have Real Problems peaked in the top 30 on the Billboard 200. At the ARIA Music Awards of 2009, she won the award for &#x27;Best Music DVD&#x27; and received six nominations at the ARIA Music Awards of 2010 and won &#x27;Best Independent Release&#x27; and &#x27;Best Pop Release&#x27; for We Are Born and &#x27;Best Video&#x27; for the song &quot;Clap Your Hands&quot;. In 2000, the Adelaide born singer scored a bolt from the blue Top 10 hit with her debut single, Taken For Granted. Pairing her unique Australian drawl with the strident strings from Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s &#x27;Romeo &amp; Juliet&#x27;, the track was championed by Trevor Nelson and had Sia performing live on Jo Whiley&#x27;s Radio 1 show. Her debut album, Healing Is Difficult, arrived to similar cries of 'the next big R&amp;B thing&#x27;. Then, to cap it all, she added her jazzy slurs to two tracks on Zero 7&#x27;s Simple Things album and became the unmistakable voice of the year&#x27;s coolest down-tempo soundtrack. All the pieces for a phenomenal career seemed to be in place. And then nothing. &quot;I went a bit mental after that,&quot; she explains, before letting out a laugh that would stop traffic. &quot;No seriously, I needed therapy and everything. &quot; She recovers her composure only long enough to explain that going from hero to zero left her confused and frustrated and that it was a really enjoyable time, those moments of feeling like a &#x27;Coolio&#x27;! But sadly they&#x27;ve passed now. Brandishing both wicked humour and brutal honesty, it&#x27;s sometimes hard to know exactly when Sia&#x27;s joking. What is certain is that, with fragile beauty, a collaboration with Beck, and swathes of sensual soul-searching, &#x27;Healing Is Difficult&#x27;s long overdue follow-up, 'Colour The Small One, rekindles thoughts of an all conquering phenomenon and will surely make her a &#x27;coolio&#x27; once again. From the lilting pianos and claustrophobic beats of Breathe Me, to Sunday&#x27;s enchanting harmonium and breathless chant, it&#x27;s a mesmerising album, undercut by the hope and despair of a little girl lost. Guilt, and how to deal with it, is the recurring theme with Sia&#x27;s vulnerable voice as a beacon guiding through the pain and fear. &quot;I call it easy Listening,&quot; snorts Sia trying to keep a straight face. &quot;That&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been telling everyone. &quot; A mix of horror and hilarity dawns on her face. &quot;Do you think it&#x27;s depressing? It&#x27;s not too depressing is it? It&#x27;s meant to be nice, easy, music. Songy and lush. &quot; Whatever it is, it certainly isn&#x27;t the album anyone was expecting. The muffled rhythm track and sensual cinematic strings of Don&#x27;t Bring Me Down are a stratosphere away from Taken For Granted&#x27;s dogmatic march. Colour The Small One would never be mistaken for R&amp;B. &quot;I hated that,&quot; she cringes at the thought of the jazzy beats and soulful grooves of her first album being tagged &#x27;urban&#x27;. But that&#x27;s not why this album&#x27;s different. &quot;I just wanted to make an album that was more song driven, and I&#x27;ve changed as a person. After the first album I lost it, and this album reflects how I was feeling. The vocals are small and needy, because that&#x27;s how I felt. &quot; She looks momentarily troubled before adding, &quot;Plus, I&#x27;d tried to have a pop career and it didn&#x27;t work, so I thought I&#x27;d try something else. &quot; More strangulated giggling. &quot;If this doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ll fuck off back to Australia. &quot; Sia&#x27;s vocal talents extend all the way back to her earliest memory. But unlike most singers, she isn&#x27;t exactly the product of her childhood influences. Born in Adelaide, she was raised on the hippiest street in Australia. &quot;Everyone was a musician or worked for Circus Oz. &quot; Her parents played in a rockabilly band called The Soda Jerks, and her dad, &quot;a real nut nut&quot;, briefly played guitar in uncle Colin&#x27;s band Men At Work- yes, they of &#x27;I Come From A Land Down Under&#x27; fame- but &quot;they kicked him out for being too in yer face. &quot; Early appearances singing Shangri-Las songs aside, Sia&#x27;s musical leanings didn&#x27;t get serious until she joined jazz-funk bar band Crisp at 17. &quot;We thought we were really cutting edge,&quot; she sniggers with a roll of her eyes, &quot;but we were trying way too hard. &quot; In fact, Sia credits the biggest influence on both her and Colour The Small One as touring with Zero 7. &quot;That&#x27;s when I actually started listening to music,&quot; she says with a grimace of embarrassment. &quot;All the other music I&#x27;d listened to in my life had been incidental; in clubs, cars, lifts. I only owned 2 CDs: The Jackson 5 anthology and Jeff Buckley&#x27;s Grace. While we were on tour, the Zero 7 guys were always talking about artists I&#x27;d never heard of, so I bought a Discman and started listening to their James Taylor, Nick Drake, Harry Neilson, Randy Newman and Django Bates CDs. And it all just really blew me away. &quot; Colour The Small One&#x27;s lyrical roots, however, run much deeper. After three years fronting Crisp, Sia packed her bags and headed off with an open ended ticket on a round the World trip. After enjoying colourful times in some unusual places, she agreed to meet up in London with the man she describes as her &#x27;first true love&#x27;. A week before she arrived, he was run down and killed by a black cab on Kensington High Street. &quot;Nearly everything on the first album was about that,&quot; she says, her chirpy facade slipping. &quot;I was pretty fucked up after Dan died. I couldn&#x27;t really feel anything. I could intellectualise a lot of stuff; that I had a purpose, that I was loved, but I couldn&#x27;t actually feel anything. The last album was very deflective. This one&#x27;s very exposing. I think that&#x27;s the difference between the two albums, the first was intellectualising, this one is feeling. &quot; Catching herself being uncharacteristically serious, she quickly deflects with a half chuckle of, &quot;and I&#x27;d quit drinking. That was probably what it was. &quot; Bully, the track she wrote with Beck has similarly serious roots. &quot;There was this kid at school who I used to be really cruel to, and I&#x27;ve felt bad about it ever since. It got to the point where I was having nightmares about it. So I wanted to write a sorry song. &quot; Thankfully, the collaboration itself had happier origins. &quot;The last date of the Zero 7 tour was a festival at the Universal Amphitheatre in LA and Beck was on the same bill. Next thing he&#x27;s ringing Zero 7&#x27;s management asking if I&#x27;d like to duet with him. &quot; Understandably she said yes, and found herself on stage singing &#x27;You&#x27;re The One That I Want&#x27; from Grease. &quot;I suggested it as a joke; but we changed the major to a minor, made it really slow and turned it into a bit of a country stalker anthem. &quot; The Beck and Zero 7 connections- Sia&#x27;s already recorded two more tracks to their next album - give the biggest clues to 'Untitled' and the giggling Australian&#x27;s current intentions. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to be a superstar, doing all that wibbly-wobbly stuff. It&#x27;s too emotionally stressful; photo shoots always make me want to have plastic surgery. I just wanted to write an album that was me: a small, weird, needy freak. It&#x27;s a slow burner, but it&#x27;s honest. &quot; Colour The Small One was released in the UK on 12th January 2004. And then, she came back with her new album Some People Have Real Problems, released on 8 January 2008. A little bit different from her previous albums, the new album received good reviews, although some critics and fans didn&#x27;t really like the new &quot;a little bit more pop&quot; direction. The first single Day Too Soon was released on 12 November 2007 in the UK and was followed by The Girl You Lost to Cocaine on the 21st April 2008 and later followed by Soon We&#x27;ll Be Found which was released on 13 October 2008. Soon We&#x27;ll Be Found got the best reviews because of its music video. In the music video, Sia sings while signing the lyrics in American Sign Language. Sia worked with Christina Aguilera on her new album Bionic and the new collaboration has produced four tracks including the soulful ballad &quot;You Lost Me&quot;. The album was released June 8, 2010. ", "Chelsea Wolfe": "Chelsea Wolfe is a singer/songwriter and eponymous full band started in 2009 out of Los Angeles, California. Her style has been described as &quot;doom folk&quot;, and her music has been described as a &quot;specific brand of drone-metal-art-folk&quot;. Inspired by the dark state of the world and the strange connection between all things, she creates a unique musical blend of goth-folk, experimental rock and spiritual realm funeral songs. With influences ranging from the great minds of Ingmar Bergman and David Lynch, to soviets and end-times literature, her songs conjure visions of other dimensions, claustrophobic echo-rooms and parking garage cathedrals. Wolfe has recorded four full length albums: The Grime and the Glow, released December 28, 2010 on limited vinyl through Brooklyn's Pendu Sound, Apokalupsis (pronounced \"Apokalypsis\"), which was released as a 12\" LP on August 23, 2011, Unknown Rooms: A Collection of Acoustic Songs, released in October, 2012, and her latest record, Pain is Beauty, out September 3, 2013. ", "Ramones": "The Ramones were a punk rock band that formed in Queens, New York, United States, in 1974. They are often cited as the first punk group. Despite achieving only limited commercial success, the band was a major influence on the punk rock movement both in the United States and the United Kingdom. All of the band members adopted pseudonyms ending with the surname &quot;Ramone&quot;, though none of them were related. They performed 2,263 concerts, touring virtually nonstop for 22 years. In 1996, after a tour with the Lollapalooza music festival, the band played a farewell concert and disbanded. By a little more than eight years after the breakup, the band&#x27;s three founding members--lead singer Joey Ramone, guitarist Johnny Ramone, and bassist Dee Dee Ramone--had died. Drummer Tommy Ramone, the last surviving original member, died in 2014. Their only record with enough U. S. sales to be certified gold was the compilation album Ramones Mania. However, recognition of the band&#x27;s importance built over the years, and they are now cited in many assessments of all-time great rock music, such as the Rolling Stone list of the 50 Greatest Artists of All Time and VH1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. In 2002, the Ramones were ranked the second-greatest band of all time by Spin magazine, trailing only The Beatles. On March 18, 2002, the Ramones--including the three founders and drummers Marky and Tommy Ramone--were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2011, the group was awarded a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. Formation: 1974-1975 Forest Hills High School, attended by the four original members of the Ramones The original members of the band met in and around the middle-class neighborhood of Forest Hills in the New York City borough of Queens. John Cummings and Thomas Erdelyi had both been in a high-school garage band from 1966 to 1967 known as the Tangerine Puppets. They became friends with Douglas Colvin, who had recently moved to the area from Germany, and Jeffry Hyman, who was the initial lead singer of the glam rock band Sniper, founded in 1972. The Ramones began taking shape in early 1974, when Cummings and Colvin invited Hyman to join them in a band. The initial lineup featured Colvin on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Cummings on lead guitar, and Hyman on drums. Colvin, who soon switched from rhythm guitar to bass, was the first to adopt the name &quot;Ramone&quot;, calling himself Dee Dee Ramone. He was inspired by Paul McCartney&#x27;s use of the pseudonym Paul Ramon during his Silver Beatles days. Dee Dee convinced the other members to take on the name and came up with the idea of calling the band the Ramones. Hyman and Cummings became Joey Ramone and Johnny Ramone, respectively. A friend of the band, Monte A. Melnick (later their tour manager), helped to arrange rehearsal time for them at Manhattan&#x27;s Performance Studios, where he worked. Johnny&#x27;s former bandmate Erdelyi was set to become their manager. Soon after the band was formed, Dee Dee realized that he could not sing and play his bass guitar simultaneously; with Erdelyi&#x27;s encouragement, Joey became the band&#x27;s new lead singer. Dee Dee would continue, however, to count off each song&#x27;s tempo with his signature rapid-fire shout of &quot;1-2-3-4!&quot; Joey soon similarly realized that he could not sing and play drums simultaneously and left the position of drummer. While auditioning prospective replacements, Erdelyi would often take to the drums and demonstrate how to play the songs. It became apparent that he was able to perform the group&#x27;s music better than anyone else, and he joined the band as Tommy Ramone. The Ramones played before an audience for the first time on March 30, 1974, at Performance Studios. The songs they played were very fast and very short; most clocked in at under two minutes. Around this time, a new music scene was emerging in New York centered around two clubs in downtown Manhattan--Max&#x27;s Kansas City and, more famously, CBGB (usually referred to as CBGB&#x27;s). The Ramones made their CBGB debut on August 16. Legs McNeil, who cofounded Punk magazine the following year, later described the impact of that performance: &quot;They were all wearing these black leather jackets. And they counted off this song&#8230;and it was just this wall of noise&#8230;. They looked so striking. These guys were not hippies. This was something completely new. &quot; The band swiftly became regulars at the club, playing there seventy-four times by the end of the year. After garnering considerable attention for their performances--which averaged about seventeen minutes from beginning to end--the group was signed to a recording contract in late 1975 by Seymour Stein of Sire Records. Stein&#x27;s wife, Linda Stein, had seen the band play at CBGB; she would later co-manage them along with Danny Fields. By this time, the Ramones were recognized as leaders of the new scene that was increasingly being referred to as &quot;punk&quot;. The group&#x27;s unusual frontman had a lot to do with their impact. As Dee Dee explained, &quot;All the other singers were copying David Johansen , who was copying Mick Jagger&#8230;. But Joey was unique, totally unique. &quot;", "Owiny Sigoma Band": "In 2009, a handful of London-based musicians travelled to Nairobi in Kenya to collaborate with local musicians there. The project was set up by Hetty Hughes and her friend Aaron Abraham, co-founders of a voluntary organisation called Art of Protest established in order to promote local musicians and rappers. Hetty and Aaron were disheartened by the way they were being sidelined and overlooked, so they set about inviting some London-based musicians to visit Nairobi and collaborate. It was a loose arrangement. . . there was no specific agenda other than to bring the musicians together, exchange ideas and enjoy the results. The traditional folkloric music of Kenya has not received the same global exposure as that of Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Africa or North Africa, for example, and one of the objectives of this project was to try and build on this. The band draw on a broad spectrum of African influences, from Fela Kuti and Tony Allen to the likes of Thomas Mapfumo and Oumou Sangare, but bar Jesse's participation with Damon Albarn's Africa Express, this was the first opportunity for Jesse Hackett (keys), Louis Hackett (bass), Sam Lewis (guitar), Chris Morphitis (bouzouki/guitar) and Tom Skinner (drums) to visit specifically for a musical project. The boys' first trip to Nairobi was in January 2009 to meet and collaborate with two Kenyan musicians: Joseph Nyamungo and Charles Okoko who hail from a village up country called Owiny Sigoma. The workshop/rehearsals were a lot of fun and pretty fruitful - \"They acted as a skills exchange and a way of sharing our music. We learned some of their songs and they learned some of our songs too,\" explains Tom. Finding a studio that could accomodate a 7-piece live band wasn't easy but eventually they holed up in an amazing disused factory space to record. The resulting four tracks made their way to Gilles Peterson who promptly signed the band to his Brownswood imprint and sent the boys back to Nairobi for another week-long recording session with Joseph, Charles and their extended musical family. The results are documented on the band's forthcoming album - a collection of gloriously hypnotic Afro grooves symbolic of the true culture clash between the Luo and London. The project will finally be released on 2nd May 2011, preceded by a 12\" boasting a monstrous Theo Parrish remix available exclusively via Record Store Day on 16th April 2011. The Motor City legend stripped back the melodic content to the bare essentials and built one of his trademark twisted trips in a whirlwind session with Floating Points at Eglo Studios, London. ", "The Doors": "The Doors were an American rock band which formed in Los Angeles, California, United States in 1965. The band consisted of Jim Morrison (vocals), Ray Manzarek (organ), Robby Krieger (guitar) and John Densmore (drums). In this configuration, the band released six albums, all of which were successful and released two US #1 hit singles - 1967&#x27;s &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and 1968&#x27;s &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot;. After Morrison&#x27;s death at his apartment at 17 Rue Beautraillis Paris in 1971, the band continued on as a trio, releasing two more albums that were ignored commercially and disliked critically before disbanding in 1973. UCLA film school students Jim Morrison and Ray Manzarek had known each other at college and met by chance on Venice beach in July 1965. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs and, at Manzarek&#x27;s encouragement, sang &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;. Manzarek immediately suggested they form a band. Keyboardist Ray Manzarek was already in the band called Rick And The Ravens with Morrison and his brother Rick Manzarek while Robby Krieger and John Densmore were playing with The Psychedelic Rangers, and knew Manzarek from shared meditation instruction. In August Densmore joined the group and, along with members of the Ravens and an unidentified female bass player, recorded a six-song demo on September 2. This was widely bootlegged and appeared in full on the 1997 Doors box set. That month the group recruited talented guitarist Robby Krieger and the final lineup--Morrison, Manzarek, Krieger and Densmore--was complete. Manzarek solved their lack of bassist by playing bass on a Fender Rhodes bass keyboard with his left hand and keyboards with his right hand. The band took their name from the title of a book by Aldous Huxley , The Doors of Perception , which was in turn borrowed from a line of poetry by the 18th century artist and poet William Blake : &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed, every thing would appear to man as it is: infinite. &quot; By 1966 the group was playing The London Fog club and soon graduated to the prestigious Whisky a Go Go. On August 10 they were spotted by Elektra Records president Jac Holzman on the insistence of Love singer Arthur Lee, whose group was on Elektra. On August 18 the group signed with the label. The timing was immaculate when, on August 21, the band was fired from the club after a profanity filled performance of &quot;The End&quot;. In an incident that was a foretelling of the controversy that would follow the group, a tripping Morrison bellowed during the &quot;Oedipal&quot; section of the song &quot;Mother&#8230;I want to&#8230;fuck you!!!&quot;. Early recording: 1967-1969 After Jack Holzman and Paul Rothchild saw two sets of the band playing at Whiskey A Go Go, the first uneven, but the second mesmerizing, the band was signed to the Elektra Records label beginning a long and successful partnership with producer Paul Rothchild and engineer Bruce Botnick. Their self-titled debut LP featured most of the major songs from their set, including the eleven-minute musical drama, &quot;The End&quot;. With the band at the peak of their form and bristling with energy and ambition, the album was recorded in only a few days, in late August and early September 1966, almost entirely live in the studio, with most songs captured in a single take. Morrison and Manzarek also directed an innovative promotional film for the single &quot;Break on Through&quot;, which was an important stepping stone in the development of the music video genre. Released in January 1967, the album caused a sensation in music circles and the second single released from it, &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, became a major hit, establishing the group alongside Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead as one of the top new American bands of 1967. It was released in April but did not hit the top, with the long middle solo cut out, until July. In September the group played the song live on the popular Ed Sullivan Show where Morrison sang the word &quot;higher&quot;, despite being asked not to by the CBS Network. They also performed a new single &quot;People Are Strange&quot; which they repeated for DJ Murray The K&#x27;s TV show on September 22. Earlier in the month the group recorded a dazzling version of &quot;The End&quot; for CBS in Toronto. It remained unreleased until the release of The Doors Soundstage Performances DVD. With his saturnine good looks, magnetic stage presence and skin-tight leather trousers, Morrison quickly became one of the major pop sex symbols of his day, although he soon became frustrated with the strictures of stardom. The second Doors LP, Strange Days , was almost as strong as the first, and it cemented the group&#x27;s reputation. More subdued and less spontaneous than the debut, the album is notable for its evocative lyricism and atmosphere. Closing track &quot;When The Music&#x27;s Over&quot; was again, like &quot;The End&quot; lengthy and dramatic and helped establish Morrison&#x27;s reputation as the wild shaman of rock. Yet the album was also strongly commercial and featured well-known Doors songs, &quot;Love Me Two Times&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot;. Morrison&#x27;s status as a figure of rebellion was further cemented on December 9 when he was arrested in New Haven, Connecticut for badmouthing the police to the audience from the stage. Morrison said he had been maced by an overzealous cop after he was caught backstage with a girl. The group finished a successful year on December 27 by taping &quot;Light My Fire&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Drive&quot; for the Jonathan Winters Show. From December 26 to 28 the group played at The Winterland San Francisco and then two dates in Denver on December 30 and 31, capping off a year of almost constant touring. As a result of their success, The Doors forfeited their status as Underground heroes. They allowed Sixteen magazine to portray them as teen idols and their &quot;spontaneous&quot; stage-show was exposed as not-so-spontaneous after all. An article by Jerry Hopkins in the February 10, 1968 edition of Rolling Stone typified the fall from grace: &quot;One shtick, or piece of stage-business, missing at the Shrine performance, was Morrison&#x27;s carefully-executed &#x27;accidental&#x27; fall from the stage into the crowd. For months this had been a part of the act. It got a lot of screams from the teenyboppers. Then a review appeared in a local newspaper which called the fall one of the phoniest things ever. Morrison was asked if he&#x27;d read the article. &#x27;Yeah,&#x27; said Morrison, &#x27;and I guess he&#x27;s right. &#x27; Morrison did not take the fall that night at the Shrine. &quot; Fraught sessions for the group&#x27;s third album took place in April as Morrison became increasingly dependent on alcohol. Approaching the height of their popularity The Doors played a series of outdoor shows which led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at Chicago Coliseum on May 10. Their third LP, Waiting for the Sun , (1968) showed the band beginning to branch out from their initial form, as they exhausted their original repertoire and began writing new material. It became their first #1 LP and the single &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; was their second and last US #1 single. The album is eclectic in style, sometimes inconsequential, and much less unified than the first two, despite containing some fine material. It further isolated them from the underground cognoscenti. As Lilian Roxon described it in her 1969 Rock Encyclopaedia, the album &quot;strengthened dreadful suspicion that the Doors were in it just for the money&quot;. It also included the song &quot;The Unknown Soldier&quot;, for which they created another self-directed music video, and &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot;, excerpted from their legendary thirty-minute concept piece Celebration of the Lizard, although they were reportedly unable to record a satisfactory version of the entire piece for the LP. This was eventually released on a later greatest hits CD compilation. A month after riotous scenes at the Singer Bowl, New York the group flew for their first dates outside of North America, to England . The group held a press conference at the ICA Gallery, London and played shows at The Roundhouse Theatre. The results of the trip were broadcast on Granada TV&#x27;s &quot;The Doors Are Open&quot; and were later released on video. The group then played dates in Europe including a show in Amsterdam without Morrison after he collapsed from a drug binge. Morrison returned to London on September 20 and stayed for a month. The group played nine more US dates and got to work in November on their fourth LP. 1969 would be a very difficult year for the group but it started well with a sold out show at the prestigious Madison Square Garden, New York on January 24 and with the success of new single &quot;Touch Me&quot; (released in December 1968), which hit US #3. That month Morrison attended a theatre production which changed the course of his and the group&#x27;s life. At the University of Southern California&#x27;s Bovard Auditorium The Living Theatre took to the stage for a highly charged show which urged people to cast aside their inhibitions to freedom. The show appealed to Morrison&#x27;s quest for personal freedom, the results of which can be heard the next evening, February 25, during a studio jam which became the legendary &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; session, later released on the 1997 Doors box set. The stage had been set for the most controversial episode of Morrison&#x27;s life and one of the most notorious rock stories. To fans of The Doors, the music included socially, psychologically and politically charged lyrics mostly written by &#x27;The Lizard King&#x27;, Jim Morrison. The jazz drumming of John Densmore, the swirling keyboards of Ray Manzarek, whose left hand played the parts typically associated with bass guitar, and Robby Krieger&#x27;s guitar playing, which showed the influence of flamenco, Indian , the blues and classical music, combined to form a distinctive sound. The Doors were unusual among rock groups in that they did not use a bass guitarist in concert, with Manzarek playing the bass lines on a Fender electric keyboard bass, an offshoot of the well-known Fender Rhodes electric piano. However, the group utilized bass players such as Jerry Scheff, Doug Lubahn, Harvey Brooks, Kerry Magness, Lonnie Mack jazz bassist LeRoy Vinnegar and Ray Neapolitan on their albums. Many of The Doors&#x27; originals were composed communally, with Morrison usually contributing the lyrics and some melody, while the others hammered out the beat and flow of the song. While Morrison and Manzarek were walking on the beach in California, they passed an African-American girl, and Morrison wrote the lyrics to Hello I Love You in a single night, referring to the girl as the &quot;dusky jewel&quot;. The song received some criticism at the time for its resemblance to The Kinks&#x27; 1965 hit &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;. Ray Davies, lead singer of the Kinks, sued the Doors for stealing the rhythm of &quot;All Day and All of the Night&quot;. Mid career controversy: 1969-1971 The Doors quickly earned a reputation as a challenging and entertaining live act, as well as having a rebellious reputation. Jim Morrison was arrested on stage in New Haven for foul language which he had directed toward police at the concert. In one appearance on September 17, 1967 with a live performance on the Ed Sullivan Show on the Columbia Broadcasting System network, the network&#x27;s censors demanded the group change its lyrics in its song, Light My Fire, altering the line, &quot;Girl, we couldn&#x27;t get much higher&quot; because of the reference to drugs. However, Morrison sang the original line instead, and on live television with no delay CBS was powerless to stop it. Ed Sullivan was so furious that he refused to shake their hands and they were never invited back. Morrison later insisted he was nervous during the performance and forgot to change the line. (They weren&#x27;t the only ones banned from the show. Eleven years earlier, Bo Diddley was banned from appearing on the show when he refused to sing Sixteen Tons. ) The most infamous incident occurred at the March 1, 1969 Dinner Key Auditorium concert in Miami, Florida. Morrison allegedly exposed himself during the performance. Morrison had been drinking since missing his flight to the show. The 6,900 seat auditorium had been oversold by almost double the hall&#x27;s capacity and fans were sweltering without air conditioning. From the moment the band walked on stage Morrison started bellowing into the microphone: &quot;Now listen here, I ain&#x27;t talking &#x27;bout no revolution and I&#x27;m not talkin&#x27; about no demonstrations. &quot;I&#x27;m talking about having a good time, I&#x27;m talking about having a good time this summer. And you all come out to L. A. , you all get out there, we&#x27;re gonna lie down there in the sand and rub our toes in the ocean, and we&#x27;re gonna have a good time, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready, are you ready? &quot;Now listen! I used to think the whole thing was a big joke. I used to think it was something to laugh about. And then the last couple of nights I met some people who were doing somethin&#x27;! They&#x27;re tryin&#x27; to change the world! And I wanna get on that trip! I wanna change the world. Wanna change it. Yeeeeeeaaaaaahhh - change it. &quot; Within a few minutes Morrison had changed his tune: &quot;Now listen, I&#x27;m not talkin&#x27; about no revolution, an&#x27; I&#x27;m not talkin&#x27; about no demonstration! I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; about having fun! I&#x27;m talkin&#x27; about dancin&#x27;! I wanna see you people get up and dance! I wanna see you people dancin&#x27; in the street this summer! I wanna see you have some fun. I wanna see you run around. I wanna see you paint the town. I wanna see you ringin&#x27; out. I wanna see you shout. I wanna see some fun. I wanna see some fun from everyone. &quot; The recording nears its end with the ominous words: &quot;ANYTHING YOU WANT! LET&#x27;S DO IT! LET&#x27;S DO IT! LET&#x27;S DO IT!&quot; The incident remains inconclusive. Morrison said: &quot;I wasted a lot of time with the Miami trial. About a year and a half. But I guess it was a valuable experience because before the trial I had a very unrealistic schoolboy attitude about the American judicial system. My eyes have been opened up a bit. &quot; While Morrison as the lead singer received the most attention of the group, as well as getting a far larger image of himself on album covers, he was quite adamant about all the members of the group getting recognition. Before one concert when the announcer introduced the group as &quot;Jim Morrison and The Doors&quot;, Morrison in a rage refused to appear unless he announced the group again, solely as &quot;The Doors&quot;. While he never felt close to his real life family, he was extremely protective of the rest of the members of The Doors. Reportedly, he once told Ray Manzarek that he never felt comfortable in a social setting unless Ray or another member of the band were with him. Many people have since come to the conclusion that he viewed The Doors as his surrogate family. This may be attributed the fact that he not only repeatedly turned down every solo album opportunity he was ever offered, but that the remaining members of The Doors refused to replace him as the singer of the band after his death. Although the band&#x27;s reputation was damaged Morrison was quietly relieved by the results of the Miami incident. He later said: &quot;I think I was just fed up with the image that had been created around me&#8230; and so I put an end to it in one glorious evening&quot;. Released from the chain of touring Morrison recorded some of his poetry that month and, in April, began shooting footage for HWY, an experimental film about a hitchiker, played by Morrison. The poetry session was used for the 1978 album An American Prayer where it was set to new music by The Doors. HWY, which contains virtually no dialogue, circulates among collectors although an official release has been rumored. In the last two years of his life Morrison curtailed his former prodigious intake of psychedelic drugs and began drinking heavily, which in turn soon began to affect his performance, both on stage and in the studio. Apparently trying to escape the image of &quot;The Lizard King&quot; that had come to dominate him, Morrison put on weight and grew a thick beard, forcing Elektra to use photos taken earlier in his career for the cover of their Absolutely Live LP, released in 1970. The album features performances recorded on their 1970 American tour and at the 1969 Aquarius Theatre gig and includes a full-length live performance of &quot;The Celebration of the Lizard&quot;. The group&#x27;s only public appearance was on a PBS television special, recorded late in April and broadcast the following month. Here the group performed songs from the upcoming Soft Parade album, including a stunning version of the title track. The group resumed touring at Chicago Auditorium Theater on June 14 and proceeded to play two dates at The Aquarius Theatre, Hollywood on July 21 and 22, both later released on CD. The shows were typical of a new kind of Doors concert where the emphasis was more on the band and fans having a good time than having a shamanistic experience. The bearded Morrison wore loose fitting clothes and steered the bands towards a bluesier direction with songs like &quot;Build Me A Woman&quot;, &quot;I Will Never Be Untrue&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;. Yet his voice had lost none of its power and the band could still dazzle with performances of &quot;When The Music&#x27;s Over&quot; and &quot;Celebration of the Lizard&quot;. Their fourth album, The Soft Parade (1969), released in July, further distanced the group from the &quot;underground&quot;, containing extremely pop-oriented arrangements, complete with &quot;Vegas-style&quot; horn sections (their single, &quot;Touch Me,&quot; featured saxophonist Curtis Amy). Morrison&#x27;s excessive drinking made him increasingly difficult and unreliable in the studio, and the sessions for the record dragged on for weeks (where they had formerly taken days). Studio costs piled up, and the group came close to disintegrating. Critics of the record see the band as struggling to maintain momentum and attempting to expand their sound with a horn section and strings, resulting in a weak record suffering from bloated overproduction. In its defense, The Soft Parade stands as an experiment that succeeded despite Morrison&#x27;s erratic behavior and numerous technical challenges. In the context of the group&#x27;s established repertoire, the record finds them exploring a new &quot;quasi-prog-pop&quot; direction. The more commercially-oriented songs such as &quot;Touch Me&quot; and &quot;Tell All The People&quot; are memorable; tracks such as &quot;Wild Child&quot; and &quot;Shaman&#x27;s Blues&quot; are as stripped down and imaginitive as ever, with particularly excellent guitar and lyrics. Amid the recording of their next album, in November 1969, Morrison found himself in trouble with the law again after becoming drunk and abusive to airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see The Rolling Stones in concert. He was acquitted the following April after a steward mistakenly identified Morrison as his traveling companion, American actor Tom Baker (Not the Tom Baker who played Dr. Who. ) The group started its year in New York again, this time over two nights at The Felt Forum. The two nights were well received. The group staged a strong return to form with their excellent 1970 LP Morrison Hotel . Featuring a consistent, hard rock sound the album contains the memorable opener &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, which typified the high-spirited assuredness of the entire album. Morrison Hotel had a buoyancy and optimism that the band had never had before with a host of celebratory songs and a couple of lovely ballads. It hit US #4. The group continued to perform at arenas throughout the summer and Morrison faced trial in Miami in August. The group managed to make it to The Isle of Wight on August 29th where a tired Morrison performed what was considered a below-par set. Songs from the show show up in 1995 on the Message To Love documentary. On September 16th, Morrison took to the stand but it was in vain, the jury returning a guilty verdict for profanity and indecent exposure on September 20. Morrison was sentenced to eight months custody but was allowed to go free pending an appeal. On December 8th, 1970, Morrison recorded another poetry session, on his 27th birthday. The Doors last public performance was at the &quot;Warehouse&quot; in New Orleans, LA on Dec. 12th, 1970, where it appeared Morrison had a mental breakdown on stage (slamming the microphone numerous times into the stage floor). The group looked set to regain their crown as one of America&#x27;s premier acts with the superb L. A. Woman in 1971. It was conceived as a &quot;back to basics&quot; album which would explore their blues and R&amp;B roots, although during rehearsals the group had a serious falling-out with Rothchild. Denouncing the new repertoire as &quot;cocktail music&quot;, he quit and handed the production reins to Botnick. The result was widely considered a classic, featuring some of the strongest material and performances since their 1967 debut. Some dissenters, however, consider nearly half the album to be lackluster blues material, detracting severely from the album&#x27;s overall quality. The atmospheric single &quot;Riders On The Storm&quot; became a mainstay of rock radio programming for decades. Aftermath of Morrison&#x27;s death: 1971-1989 In 1971, following the recording of L. A. Woman , Morrison decided to take some time out and moved to Paris with girlfriend Pamela Courson, in March. He had visited the previous summer and, for a time, seemed contented to write and explore the city. But by June he was once again drinking heavily and suffered a fall from a second story window in May. On June 16 the last known recording of Morrison was made when he befriended two street musicians at a bar and invited them to a recording studio. The drunken results were later released on bootleg CD. Morrison died under mysterious circumstances on 3 July 1971; his body was found in the bathtub of his apartment. It was concluded that he died of a heart attack, although it was later revealed that no autopsy had been performed before Morrison&#x27;s body was buried at the Pere-Lachaise Cemetery on July 7. Rumours persisted for many years that Morrison had faked his death to escape the spotlight, as did the rumour that Morrison had actually died at a Paris nightclub and that his body had been surreptitiously taken back to his apartment. However, in his book Wonderland Avenue, Morrison&#x27;s former associate Danny Sugerman states that during his last meeting with Courson, which took place shortly before she died of a heroin overdose, she confessed to Sugerman that she had introduced Morrison to the drug and that, because he had a fear of needles, she had injected him with the dose that killed him. The remaining Doors continued for some time. After initially considering replacing Morrison with a new singer, Krieger and Manzarek took over on vocals, and released two more albums, Other Voices and Full Circle . The Doors also toured during this time. Both albums sold well, but not in the numbers of the Morrison era releases, and the Doors ceased all performing and recording activities at the end of 1972. While the first is unmistakably Doors in sound and style, the last album showed the Doors further expanding into jazz territory. While neither album have yet seen CD reissues in the U. S. , they have been released on 2-on-1 CDs in Germany and Russia and are being heard via internet P2P networks and are undergoing fan reevaluation. The remaining Doors recorded a third post-Morrison album, An American Prayer released in 1978, this time providing only backup music to recordings of Morrison&#x27;s poetry. In 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released Apocalypse Now with &quot;The End&quot; used prominently in the sound track. With this, &quot;The Doors&quot; were rediscovered by new fans. In 1983, &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot; was released, which included a cover version of the Them hit &quot;Gloria&quot;, adding it officially to the Elektra Records discography. The 1990s and beyond In 1991, director Oliver Stone released his film The Doors, starring Val Kilmer as Morrison and with cameos by Krieger and Densmore. Ian Astbury of The Cult was Stone&#x27;s preferred choice, but Astbury decided not to enter the acting world for reasons unknown. While all were amazed at Kilmer&#x27;s impersonation, the film had numerous factual inaccuracies and members of the group later voiced displeasure at Stone&#x27;s portrayal of Morrison, at times making him look like an out-of-control sociopath. In 2002 Manzarek and Krieger reunited and created a new version of The Doors, called &quot;The Doors of the 21st Century&quot;. In the place of Morrison, the new lineup was fronted by British vocalist Ian Astbury, former lead singer of UK band The Cult, with Angelo Barbera from Krieger&#x27;s band on bass. At their first concert the group announced that drummer John Densmore would not perform, and it was later reported that he was unable to play because he suffered from tinnitus. Densmore was initially replaced by Stewart Copeland, formerly of The Police, but after Copeland broke his arm falling off a bicycle, the arrangement ended in mutual lawsuits and he was replaced by Ty Dennis, drummer with Krieger&#x27;s band. Densmore subsequently claimed that he had in fact not been invited to take part in the reunion. In February 2003 he filed an injunction against his former bandmates hoping to prevent them from using the name &quot;The Doors of the 21st Century&quot;. His motion was denied in court in May that year, although Manzarek publicly reiterated that the invitation for Densmore to return to the group still stood. It was also reported that both Morrison&#x27;s family and that of Pamela Courson had joined Densmore in seeking to prevent Manzarek and Krieger from using The Doors&#x27; name. In July 2005, Densmore and the Morrison estate won a permanent injunction; thereby preventing his former bandmates from using The Doors&#x27; name. The new band initially switched to the name &quot;D21C&quot; and now plays under the name Riders on the Storm, which is itself the name of a Doors tribute band in the northeastern US. They are allowed to play under names such as &quot;former Doors&quot; and &quot;members of The Doors&quot;. Densmore has also been steadfast in refusing to license The Doors&#x27; music for use in television commercials, including an offer of $15 million by Cadillac to lease the song &quot;Break on Through (to the Other Side)&quot;, feeling that that would be in violation of the spirit in which the music was created. Densmore wrote about this subject for The Nation, noting,  People lost their virginity to this music, got high for the first time to this music. I&#x27;ve had people say kids died in Vietnam listening to this music, other people say they know someone who didn&#x27;t commit suicide because of this music. . . . On stage, when we played these songs, they felt mysterious and magic. That&#x27;s not for rent. Manzarek and Krieger maintain that touring as a Doors revival and licensing the music to advertisements are a means to keep The Doors from fading into history. Manzarek was quoted as saying, &quot;We&#x27;re all getting older. We should, the three of us, be playing these songs because, hey, the end is always near. Morrison was a poet, and above all, a poet wants his words heard. &quot; The Doors are remembered for shamanistic live performances. Some members of the &quot;establishment&quot;, however, felt that they were merely American rock music rebels. Jim Morrison said: &quot;I like any reaction I can get with my music. Just anything to get people to think. I mean if you can get a whole room full of drunk, stoned people to actually wake up and think, you&#x27;re doing something. &quot; Their enduring popularity is reflected by continuing sales of their early work. Recorded output The Doors left a reasonably concise discography for an era dominated by groups which seemed to rush out an album every six months and a high number of non-album singles. The first, self-titled album is generally thought to be the strongest and is a regular sight in greatest 100 album lists. Strange Days , Morrison Hotel and L. A Woman are all highly rated by fans and, due to their different styles, (psychedelic pop, hard rock, blues) appeal to some more than others. Waiting For The Sun contains some strong tracks but is thematically weak. The Soft Parade is considered by some to be &quot;plain bad and for fans only&quot;. 1970&#x27;s Absolutely Live and 1983&#x27;s Alive She Cried are good examples of the band&#x27;s live show and are available on CD. The 2CD In Concert is better value for money as it collects the two and adds an interesting version of &quot;The End&quot; from the Hollywood Bowl show in 1968. Only three non-album tracks were released in the band&#x27;s lifetime, the b-sides &quot;Who Scared You&quot;, &quot;Tree Trunk&quot;, and a cover of Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;(You Need Meat) Don&#x27;t Go Further&quot; sung by Ray. &quot;Who Scared You&quot; and &quot;(You Need Meat) Don&#x27;t Go Further&quot; appeared on the 1972 compilation Weird Scenes Inside The Goldmine while only &quot;Who Scared You&quot; has since been given a further CD release, on the 1997 box set. In 1978 the surviving Doors re-united to add music to poetry recorded by Morrison in 1969 and 1970. The resulting album was &quot; An American Prayer &quot; and was re-issued on CD in 1995 with bonus tracks &quot;Hour For Magic&quot;, &quot;Freedom Exists&quot;, &quot;A Feast Of Friends&quot;, &quot;Babylon Fading&quot;, &quot;Bird Of Prey&quot; and &quot;The Ghost Song (extended version)&quot;. The group had always shied away from releasing archive Doors material but in 1997 relented with the release of The Doors box set. While hardcore fans complained that most of the material had been previously released on bootlegs the 4CD set, one of which was a &quot;greatest hits&quot; type CD, proved popular. It was notable for a CD of highlights from the 1970 Felt Forum concert and a cleaned-up recording of the (edited) 1969 &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; session. The surviving members again re-united to add new musical backing to the solo Morrison song &quot;Orange County Suite&quot;. In November 2000 came the announcement many fans had dreamed of when The Doors announced the creation of Bright Midnight Records, a label through which 36 albums and 90 hours of previously unreleased Morrison-era Doors material would be made available on CD. This was launched with a sampler of forthcoming material, mostly from live concerts. The first full release was a 2CD set of the May 1970 show at Detroit Cobo Arena. It was followed by two CDs of interviews, mostly with Morrison, and the two 1969 Aquarius shows and one of the rehearsals. A 4CD set &quot;Boot Yer Butt&quot; unashamedly used bootleg quality material but sold out nevertheless. It was notable for the inclusion of the only known performances of songs from L. A Woman including the title track and &quot;The Changeling&quot; from The Doors&#x27; last but one show, in December 1970, Dallas, Texas. In 2005 a 2CD concert from Philadelphia in 1970 was released. Many illegal bootleg recordings are available of the group. Most impressive is a wealth of shows from March 1967 at the legendary Matrix Club in San Francisco. Many shows are available from 1968 when the band reached the height of its popularity, notably two shows in Stockholm, Sweden. The infamous Miami show has become widely available while many 1970 shows, notably a radio broadcast of the June 6 Vancouver show, make the rounds. The complete 1969 &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot; studio jam was discovered in the mid 1990s. Recently, a commercial for Star Motorcycles featuring the Doors song &quot;Riders on the Storm&quot; has been seen. Discography: - albums: - 1. The Doors (1967) 2. Strange Days (1967) 3.

An American Prayer (1978)", "M83": "M83 is the rock and electronic music project of the French artist Anthony Gonzalez. He and former member Nicolas Fromageau founded the group in 2001 in Antibes, France. M83&#x27;s style owes a lot to the shoegaze genre, in that there is much emphasis on tonality, extensive use of reverb effects and often softly-spoken lyrics at times submerged in instrumentation. M83 was named after the spiral galaxy &quot;Messier 83&quot;. M83 has released the following albums: M83 in 2001, Dead Cities, Red Seas &amp; Lost Ghosts in 2003, Before the Dawn Heals Us in 2005, Digital Shades Vol. 1 in 2007, Saturdays = Youth in 2008, Hurry Up, We&#x27;re Dreaming in 2011, Oblivion and You and the Night in 2013. For the third album released by M83, Before the Dawn Heals Us , Gonzalez decided to part from Fromageau (after an emotionally distressing tour for Dead Cities). Currently Anthony Gonzalez records mainly on his own(Nicolas Fromageau started Team Ghost in 2009), often with the help of his brother Yann Gonzalez, vocalist/keyboardist Morgan Kibby, guitarist/bassist Pierre-Marie Maulini, and drummer Loic Maurin. M83 produced the remix of the track &quot;Pioneers&quot; on the British rock group Bloc Party&#x27;s 2005 album Silent Alarm Remixed . M83 also collaborated with other Gooom Disques artists in a collaborative LP, under the name Purple Confusion. Just after the Before the Dawn Heals Us US tour, Anthony Gonzalez decided to take M83 in a more ambient direction (as heard on some earlier M83 tracks) and started to write and record a collection of ambient works. The relevance of digital music (from creation to sharing), gave him the idea to call the project Digital Shades Vol. 1 , and to make the album part of an ongoing series. M83&#x27;s 2008 album Saturdays = Youth , released on Mute, was recorded with the help of Ken Thomas and Ewan Pearson. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Couleurs&quot; in February 2008, &quot;Graveyard Girl&quot; in April, &quot;Kim &amp; Jessie&quot; in July, and &quot;We Own the Sky&quot; in December. In December 2008, M83 supported Kings of Leon on its UK tour. In January and February 2009, M83 supported The Killers across USA tour dates and toured with Depeche Mode on its Tour of the Universe in Italy, Germany, and France. The double album Hurry Up, We&#x27;re Dreaming was released on 17th October 2011, through Naive, produced by Justin Meldal-Johnson (Beck, NIN, The Mars Volta, Goldfrapp) and including contributions from Zola Jesus, Brad Laner (from 90&#x27;s band Medicine) on guitar, and the vocalist Morgan Kibby. The album was preceded by the track &quot;Midnight City&quot; released in July 2011. Official site: http://www. ilovem83. com", "New Order": "New Order are an alternative rock/electronic dance band which formed in 1980 in Salford, England, United Kingdom by the three remaining members of Joy Division. The band&#x27;s classic lineup consists of Bernard Sumner (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Peter Hook (bass, electronic percussion), Gillian Gilbert (keyboards, guitar) and Stephen Morris (drums, keyboards). The group effectively disbanded in 1993 but reformed in 1998. Gilbert left in 2001 to look after her and Morris&#x27; children and was replaced by guitarist/keyboardist Phil Cunningham. Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and declared the band to be defunct. Initially, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris denied the band had split up, but in 2009, following the release of the trio&#x27;s Bad Lieutenant album, they admitted that that they could not continue on without Hook and officially disbanded. However, the band reformed in 2011 for a pair of charity dates without Hook, with Gilbert returning to the fold and Tom Chapman replacing Hook on bass. Pioneers of dance music in the 1980s and one of the first bands to effectively and popularly synthesize keyboard- and guitar-based music, New Order&#x27;s members hailed from Salford and Macclesfield, England out of the ashes of Joy Division, are noted as being one of the first bands to bridge the gap between Post-Punk and Dancefloor. They were Factory Records&#x27; highest selling artist. They also funded Factory&#x27;s famous Manchester club, The Hacienda. The band partnered with Quincy Jones&#x27;s American label Qwest, recorded with legendary hip-hop producer Arthur Baker (on 1983&#x27;s single &quot;Confusion&quot; and 1984&#x27;s &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;), and they embraced Ibizan club culture on the album, Technique . The band was formed in 1980 by the three surviving members, Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook and Stephen Morris of Joy Division after the lead singer Ian Curtis committed suicide. Morris&#x27; girlfriend (and later wife) Gillian Gilbert joined in October 1980 on keyboards and occasional guitar shortly after contributing guitar to the second release of New Order&#x27;s first single &quot;Ceremony&quot;. Their early music followed in the same vein as Joy Division, most notably on debut album Movement . This is mostly seen now as a &#x27;transitional&#x27; album where the new 4-piece band was trying to find a new identity. They continued to develop their music and their identity with tracks such as &quot;Procession&quot; and &quot;Temptation&quot; until 1983 when, under the influence of early electro funk and Italo-Disco tracks (most notably Klein &amp; MBO&#x27;s Dirty Talk), they released &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, arguably their most famous song and the biggest-selling 12&quot; single of all time. This came in such a detailed Peter Saville-designed sleeve (replicating a floppy disc) that it is claimed by some that the band&#x27;s record company, Factory, lost money on every copy sold. The release of &quot;Blue Monday&quot; coincided with the album Power, Corruption &amp; Lies which further developed their dance/rock crossover. Other albums followed in 1985 ( Low-Life ), 1986 ( Brotherhood ) and 1989 ( Technique , influenced heavily by Ibiza&#x27;s acid house scene). In 1990 the band scored their sole number 1 hit with a song written by Keith Allen and performed with the England football team, &quot;World in Motion&quot;, the official England World Cup song. One more album, Republic followed in May 1993, which was released by London Records after the collapse of Factory in November 1992. The band effectively split in 1993 to pursue solo projects, but returned with a triumphant gig at the Reading Festival in 1998. After the recording of 2001&#x27;s Get Ready album Gillian Gilbert left the band amicably for family reasons - her and Stephen&#x27;s daughter Grace had been diagnosed with Transverse myelitis and she came to the decision that it would be easier for the band to replace her than her husband. They have since gone on to produce one more album with the help of Phil Cunningham of Marion when they released their last album, Waiting For The Sirens&#x27; Call . Hook left acrimoniously in 2007 and according to him, the band has effectively broken up. However, Sumner, Cunningham and Morris repeatedly denied that the band was over, and that if Hook no longer wanted to be in the band, that was his choice. Hook has since threatened to take legal action if they attempt to continue as New Order. In 2009, Sumner, Morris and Cunningham announced that they did not plan on continuing on as New Order without Hook. However, in September 2011 it was announced that they will reform as New Order for two concerts in October (Brussels and Paris), without Hook but with Gillian Gilbert. Hook&#x27;s replacement is Tom Chapman, who is also in Bad Lieutenant with Sumner, Morris and Cunningham. The charity gigs in Brussels and Paris were very successful and New Order decided to go on tour in 2012. They played various concerts all over the world and also some big festivals in the summer. Discography (studio albums): Movement (1981) Power, Corruption &amp; Lies (1983) Low-Life (1985) Brotherhood (1986) Technique (1989) Republic (1993) Get Ready (2001) Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call (2005)  Collaborations and other projects: Shortly after the split, Sumner and Cunningham formed Bad Lieutenant. The band&#x27;s debut album Never Cry Another Tear , released in 2009, features Morris on drums on several tracks, although he is not an official member of the band and has committed to continue musical projects with Gillian Gilbert. The band&#x27;s various solo projects understandably seemed to contain elements of the New Order &#x27;sound&#x27;, and gave some clues as to each member&#x27;s contribution to the band. Bernard Sumner worked with Johnny Marr (formerly of The Smiths) and Neil Tennant (of The Pet Shop Boys) in the &#x27;supergroup&#x27;, Electronic. Peter Hook formed the bands Revenge and, later, Monaco. These projects gained some commercial success. Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert recorded two albums of songs as The Other Two, and also did scoring work for film and television. Each of New Order&#x27;s four original members have, at various times, acted as producers and/or guest musicians under the moniker of Be Music for a myriad of Factory labelmates and other artists, including: Section 25, A Certain Ratio, Happy Mondays, Paul Haig, The Stockholm Monsters, The Stone Roses, and Stanton Miranda. ", "Calvin Harris": "Adam Richard Wiles (born 17 January 1984), better known by his stage name Calvin Harris, is a Scottish singer, songwriter and record producer. He was born and grew up in Dumfries, Scotland. His interest in electronic music surfaced in his early teenage years, producing his first bedroom demo by the age of 15. His first album I Created Disco was released on 18 June 2007. The album contained up-tempo electroclash songs that were influenced by music from the 1980s. To promote &#x27;I Created Disco&#x27;, Harris embarked on a tour of the UK, supporting Faithless and Groove Armada. The first release from the album was Vegas on limited edition vinyl and the first charted single released from the album was Acceptable In The 80&#x27;s, a tribute to the style and culture of the decade. The song reached the top ten on the UK singles chart, remaining on the chart for fifteen weeks. The Girls was the album&#x27;s second charted single. The fourth release from the album was Merrymaking At My Place however it only reached #43 in the UK chart. &#x27;Merrymaking At My Place&#x27; caused Harris some un-needed press, as the song and video promoted filming parties at teenagers&#x27; houses, and placing them on Youtube. Harris&#x27; second studio album Ready For The Weekend was released on August 17, 2009 in the United Kingdom. The first single, I&#x27;m Not Alone, was exclusively performed in Sydney, on New Year&#x27;s Eve. The single was released in April 2009. The new single debuted on BBC Radio 1 on Friday 23 January 2009, on the &#x27;Pete Tong&#x27; radio show. The song featured on his MySpace with the infamous spoiler, which repeated the phrase &#x27;I Am Your Nan&#x27; in a robotic voice. It debuted in the UK Singles Chart at #1 on Easter Sunday on downloads alone. http://djz. com/featured_djs/calvin-harris/ www. calvinharris. tv www. wikipedia. org/wiki/Calvin_Harris www. calvinharris. wikia. com/", "Bigbang": "Bigbang is the name of more than one artist. 1) Norwegian rock band 2) South Korean hip hop &amp; R&amp;B group Bigbang have been dubbed Norway's Greatest Live Band, and have been a major force in the Norwegian music scene for over a decade. During the past two years, the band has spent time focusing on the American market. Based in California, they have toured the country, playing intimate gigs and promoting their American debut From Acid to Zen, a compilation of songs from previously released albums. The album was very well received and resulted in great reviews among others from Rolling Stone Magazine's Editor David Fricke: It's a shotgun buffet, like those early U. S. LPs by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones that combined album tracks and singles from unrelated sessions, and it succeeds the same way: like an instant greatest-hits record. Singer-guitarist-songwriter Oystein Greni has the right history in his genes -- his dad sang in a Norwegian band that opened for Led Zeppelin in 1968 -- and he grounds songs like \"Early December,\" \"Hurricane Boy\" and the brilliantly titled \"From Acid to Zen\" in the eternal power-chord charge and fish-hook riffs of the Stones and the Who. But Greni also has a knack for wringing fresh excitement from the familiar: the country-angel harmonies and ice-Byrds guitar in the new version of \"Wild Bird,\" the improbable dream of Badfinger and Husker Du in \"The One. \" - David Fricke, Rolling Stone Magazine Edendale was recorded in the legendary Sound City Studios, with an impressive list of collaborators: Producers: Oystein Greni and Greg Richling (Wallflowers) Technician/mixer: Bryan Cook (Damian Rice, Jackson Browne, Stevie Nicks, Elton John etc) Mastered by: Gavin Lurssen (Robert Plant/Alison Krauss, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello) Guest guitarists: David Rawlings (Ryan Adams, Gillian Welch), Jared Nelson Smith (Hello Stranger) Release date in Norway: 9th of March Other territories: summer/autumn 2009 members as of April 2009: Oystein Greni (Guitar, vocals) Olaf Olsen (Drums, percussion and backing vocals) Nikolai Eilertsen (Bass, backing vocals) If you are looking for the South Korean pop group comprised of five members see bigbaeng or Big Bang. ", "Nine Inch Nails": "Nine Inch Nails is a Cleveland, OH, USA, Industrial rock band that was formed in 1988 by Trent Reznor, the only constant member of the band. He&#x27;s generally credited for popularizing the genre known as &quot;industrial rock&quot; with both his releases and dark, theatrical music videos. Born Michael Trent Reznor, he was raised by his maternal grandparents in Mercer, Pennsylvania, USA. Reznor took up piano at the age of five and in high school took up the tuba and saxophone. In the early to mid-80s, Trent played with various synthpop and new wave groups such as Exotic Birds and Option 30 before beginning his solo project. As a member of Exotic Birds, he appeared in the Michael J. Fox and Joan Jett film Light of Day . He also was mentioned on local TV as a proponent of electronic music in general. Before the 1989 release of NIN&#x27;s first album, &#x27; Pretty Hate Machine &#x27;, he worked for Right Track Studio as a handyman heavily interested in recording technology. Both the name of Reznor&#x27;s band and the title of his second single, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;, came from remarks by Al Jourgensen of Ministry, Reznor&#x27;s biggest influence. Nine Inch Nails has issued eight major albums, which have generally received both critical and commercial acclaim. Historically, NIN releases have been assigned a &quot; Halo &quot; index number. For example, the album &#x27; With Teeth &#x27; is also known as Halo 19. With the inclusion of the &#x27; Broken &#x27; EP, the band&#x27;s primary releases are: 1. &#x27; Pretty Hate Machine &#x27; (1989) 2. &#x27; Broken &#x27; EP (1992) 3. &#x27; The Downward Spiral &#x27; (1994) 4. &#x27; The Fragile (Left) &#x27; / &#x27; &#x27;The Fragile (Right) &#x27; (1999) 5. &#x27; With Teeth &#x27; (2005) 6. &#x27; Year Zero &#x27; (2007) 7. &#x27; Ghosts I-IV &#x27; (2008) 8. &#x27; The Slip &#x27; (2008) 9. &#x27; Hesitation Marks &#x27; (2013) Nine Inch Nails has also produced a number of EP&#x27;s, remixes, and provided contributions to various movie soundtracks, including &#x27; Lara Croft: Tomb Raider &#x27;, &#x27; The Crow &#x27;, &#x27; Natural Born Killers &#x27;, &#x27; Lost Highway &#x27;, and &#x27; Tetsuo: The Bullet Man &#x27;. Trent Reznor additionally provided the soundtrack for the massively popular id Software game Quake , a release inspired by ambient music. His team up with Atticus Ross resulted in the critically praised soundtrack to the film &#x27;The Social Network&#x27;, with the Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross duo winning an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 83rd Academy Awards In 2002, a live album (their second live release, the first being the video &#x27;Closure Documentary&#x27;) entitled &#x27; And All That Could Have Been &#x27; was released on DVD &amp; CD. The Deluxe version of the CD came packaged with a mini album called &#x27; Still &#x27;. That release featured several previously released songs in a stripped down, near-acoustic format along with several other new compositions. Nine Inch Nails as a live band is generally understood to be a separate entity from its recording studio-based component. Occasionally, past band members are invited to participate in the process when not directly involved with recording new material, Nine Inch Nails&#x27; lineup tends to change drastically between major tours. Aside from Trent Reznor remaining on lead vocals, nothing about the live band has remained constant since its inception. Reznor cited the long gestation period between studio albums as part of the reason for these frequent personnel changes. Beginning in late 2005, the live band featured Aaron North on guitar, Jeordie White on bass guitar, Alessandro Cortini on keyboards, and Josh Freese on drums, though all occasionally performed with different instruments. This lineup toured Europe, Asia, Australia, and America through 2007. Trent Reznor reported that he would disband the &quot;rock band configuration&quot; of his touring lineup after their concert in Honolulu, Hawaii on September 18, 2007, and would explore other means to perform Nine Inch Nails material on subsequent tours. Despite this claim he has regained the rock group lineup for the &#x27;Lights In The Sky Over&#8230;&#x27; tours with Robin Finck returning on guitar and Justin Meldal-Johnsen of Beck and other projects accompanying Cortini and Freese. Past live band members include (listed chronologically): * Ron Musarra: Drums, Samplers * Chris Vrenna: Keyboards, Samplers, Drums * Richard Patrick: Guitar * Jeff Ward: Drums * David Haymes: Keyboards * Nick Rushe: Keyboards * Lee Mars: Keyboards * James Woolley: Keyboards * Robin Finck: Guitar, Synthesizer * Danny Lohner: Bass, Guitar, Synthesizer * Charlie Clouser: Synthesizer, Drums on 5 songs during the Dissonance side of David Bowie&#x27;s Outside tour, Theremin * Sean Beavan: Soundboard, Backing vocals on 5 songs * Jerome Dillon: Drums * Alex Carapetis: Drums * Ilan Rubin: Drums The September 14, 2007 edition of the Honolulu Star-Bulletin reported that the September 18 show in Honolulu, Hawaii would be the last performance of the current incarnation of the Nine Inch Nails live band. Trent Reznor was quoted as stating, &quot;at this point, I want to switch things around a bit. Nine Inch Nails as a rock band configuration, we&#x27;ve done it and we&#x27;ve done it again. I see other ways I can present the material in concert, more challenging, something new. I don&#x27;t want it to go stale. &quot; A DVD/Blu-Ray/HD-DVD of live material from the 2006 With Teeth tour was released in late February 2007 entitled Nine Inch Nails Live: Beside You In Time . All three formats include 24 songs from the summer and winter 2006 tours, plus bonus material. Information about Nine Inch Nails concerts can be found on the NIN website . Ghosts I-IV was released on March 2, 2008. It contains 36 instrumental tracks and was recorded in ten weeks of fall 2007. Initially intended to be a five-track EP, the album is presented in the form of four nine-track EPs. The tracks do not have names, and are only identified by their track listing and position on the EPs. Ghosts I-IV also adds to the recent experimentation with digital distribution; the album is available in many different ways, including a digital download, for purchase or (partially) free, a CD set, and a deluxe edition set. The eighth album called &quot;The Slip&quot; was officially released on May 5, 2008. The whole album can be downloaded for free from this website: Nine Inch Nails - The Slip On February 16th 2009, Trent announced that he would begin his last tour. Nine Inch Nails would indefinitely end. However, it is not likely that this is the end of his music career. In his letter , he hinted that he may do something with Jane&#x27;s Addiction. In addition, Reznor has said outright in an interview on the official website that he is not done making music as Nine Inch Nails, but that he is done touring. Trivia: * Trent Reznor has worked with several big names in musical collaboration outside of NIN in recent years, including time rocker artist David Bowie, Maynard James Keenan of Tool, Zach de La Rocha of Rage Against the Machine, Peter Murphy of Bauhaus, Josh Wink, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, slam poet Saul Williams, hip-hop producer Puff Daddy &amp; The Family, Peter Gabriel, Henry Rollins and more recently, hip-hop producer El-P and Queens of the Stone Age. * Contrary to popular belief, Suck is technically a cover and not an original. The song was originally performed by the band Pigface on the album Gub (1991), a band which Trent worked with in the past. Trent is given vocal and writing credits and the song was later re-recorded for the Broken EP (1992) as a hidden track . * Legendary country star Johnny Cash covered Hurt on the album The Man Comes Around. * NIN along with Marilyn Manson, Maynard James Keenan, Phil Anselmo and other artists worked together to produce the Tapeworm Project, a side project that existed from the mid-1990s through to 2004. ", "Napoleon Solo": "Napoleon Solo was formed in the summer of 1984 by eight youngsters living in Copenhagen and they played their first gig that year. The unique blend of Sixties-influenced soul, R&amp;B, Jamaican ska and British Two-Tone proved from the beginning to be a great success. All the time Napoleon Solo has been known for a lively performance with a fresh attitude. Always sharply dressed. The band played in Hamburg for the first time in 1985 supporting the British band Making Time, but this concert was just the first of many performances in Germany. In 1988 Napoleon Solo went to England to make recordings for the bands first EP \"How To Steal The World\". The EP was produced by the legendary Buster Bloodwessel of Bad Manners and released on Unicorn Records. At the time of the release of the EP Napoleon Solo went back to England to join the Blue Beat Explosion Tour with Bad Manners. The band played seven concerts around the UK. From this tour, Napoleon Solo appeared on the live-album \"Live in London\" with the song \"Drive me Wild\". In an article in the British magazine NME, Napoleon Solo was chosen to be among the 10 best ska-bands in the world. In 1989 Napoleon Solo recorded their first album \"Shot!\", which was published by Vielklang/Pork Pie in Germany and by Bluebeat Records in the UK. Once again the band was touring both Germany and England. The following year, the band went back to Germany, with a changed lineup, and played seven sweaty concerts from Hamburg to Munich. The band broke up in 1992 but was reunited in 1996 and played with different lineups until 1999. In March 2009 Napoleon Solo was reunited with the original lineup for the first time in 10 years The album Shot was re-released in 2011 with bonus- and livetracks on the the label VME. 2011 was also the year that the band performed the song We Are Copenhagen on the album FCK CD Vol. III. A tribute to the local football team FC Kobenhavn (Copenhagen). Napoleon Solo was supporting The Specials in VEGA, Copenhagen. ", "Fleetwood Mac": "Fleetwood Mac is a British and American rock band formed in 1967. From the band&#x27;s inception through the end of 1974, no incarnation of Fleetwood Mac lasted longer than two years, but all featured core members Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. Their two most successful periods have been during the late 60s British blues boom, when they were led by guitarist/singer-songwriter Peter Green, and from 1975 to 1987, when they went a pop-oriented direction with musicians Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham, and Stevie Nicks. The band enjoyed more modest success in the intervening period between 1971 and 1974, with a line-up that included Bob Welch, and also during the 90s, which saw more personnel changes before the return of Nicks and Buckingham in 1997. More recently, the departure of Christine McVie from Fleetwood Mac in 1998 shifted around the group&#x27;s plans for many years. McVie returned to the fold in 2014 and a coming tour featuring the reunited line-up is in the works. The only member present in the band from the very beginning is its namesake drummer Mick Fleetwood. Bassist John McVie, despite his giving part of his name to the band, did not play on their first single nor at their first concerts. Keyboardist Christine McVie has, to date, appeared on all but two albums, either as a member or as a session musician. She also supplied the artwork for the album &#x27; Kiln House &#x27;. The band was started in London in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green, who recruited the rhythm section of John Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers: drummer Mick Fleetwood and bass guitarist John McVie. Green himself had replaced a departing member, Eric Clapton, as the lead guitarist of the &quot;Bluesbreakers;&quot; Green and McVie had appeared on John Mayall&#x27;s 1967 A Hard Road album. The band employed another bassist, Bob Brunning, until John McVie was persuaded to join the band. (The band&#x27;s first album Fleetwood Mac contains one song with Brunning on bass. ) Slide-guitarist and Elmore James devotee, Jeremy Spencer, rounded out the lineup. After its second album, Mr. Wonderful, a third guitarist, 18-year-old Danny Kirwan, was added to the lineup. At this point the band began shifting into a more melodic, introspective, and experimental/progressive mode. Most performances were built around the twin leads of Green and Kirwan, and Kirwan&#x27;s songwriting was featured in nearly equal proportion to Green&#x27;s. After releasing two successful singles, the instrumental &quot;Albatross&quot; (which remains the band&#x27;s only #1 hit in the UK), and the ballad &quot;Man of the World&quot; , it produced what is often considered the best album of the band&#x27;s Peter Green era, Then Play On . Spencer was, for the most part, absent from these recording sessions. The epic 2-part &quot;Oh Well&quot; single followed , and was included in later pressings of the U. S. LP album (and in all CDs). The band was then rocked by Peter Green&#x27;s decision to leave. Debate rages on the reasons for this, but it is agreed that Green wished to play a more experimental and improvisational style. Drugs, particularly LSD, also played a large part, as Green recorded sporadically before falling into a twenty-year period of mental illness. After a short gap, Christine McVie (a. k. a. under her maiden name Christine Perfect) joined the band on keyboards, and the band moved from the blues to a more melodic pop style. The early 1970s of Fleetwood Mac were turbulent for the band, which gained and lost members at a troubling rate. Jeremy Spencer disappeared during an American tour, and was found to have joined the controversial Children of God cult. American guitarist Bob Welch joined up, at the suggestion of good friend Judy Wong, lending a jazz-rock flavor to Kirwan&#x27;s more melodic songs. Kirwan&#x27;s and Welch&#x27;s tenures overlapped by two albums, but eventually, Kirwan&#x27;s own erratic behavior on tour led to his dismissal in late 1972. Welch&#x27;s contributions included &quot;Future Games&quot; (from 1971&#x27;s Future Games ), &quot;Sentimental Lady&quot; (from 1972&#x27;s Bare Trees ), and &quot;Hypnotized&quot; (from 1973&#x27;s Mystery To Me ). Bob Weston (guitar) and Savoy Brown&#x27;s Dave Walker (vocals) were also briefly hired during this phase of the band. Walker was fired after just one album, but the firing of Weston, for an alleged affair with Mick Fleetwood&#x27;s wife, during a late 1973 tour led to that tour&#x27;s abrupt cancellation. This led its manager, Clifford Davis, to send another dummy band out on the road billed as &quot;Fleetwood Mac,&quot; but featuring no original members of the band, resulting in a year-long legal battle. The fake Fleetwood Mac scored one hit a couple of years later (&quot;Why Did You Do It?&quot;) under their new name Stretch In late 1974, Welch indicated that he intended to leave the band, and Fleetwood and John McVie needed to fill the possible vacancy. While Fleetwood was scouting Van Nuys, California&#x27;s Sound City Studios, house engineer Keith Olsen played a track titled &quot;Frozen Love,&quot; which he had mixed there for an obscure American duo, Buckingham Nicks. Fleetwood liked what he heard, and he was introduced to the guitarist, Lindsey Buckingham, who just happened to be in the building. When Welch resigned from the band, Fleetwood asked Buckingham to join. Buckingham agreed, on the condition that his musical partner and girlfriend, Stevie Nicks, also become part of the band. In 1975, under new management by Gabriele Arras, the new lineup released the eponymous Fleetwood Mac (otherwise known as The White Album ). This proved to be a breakthrough for the band and it became a huge hit. The band was catapulted into stardom. Among the hit singles from this album were Christine McVie&#x27;s &quot;Over My Head&quot; and &quot;Say You Love Me,&quot; and Stevie Nicks&#x27;s &quot;Rhiannon (Will You Ever Win). &quot; But in 1976, with the success of the band also came the end of John and Christine McVie&#x27;s marriage, as well as Buckingham&#x27;s and Nicks&#x27;s longtime romantic relationship. Pressure was put on Fleetwood Mac to release a successful follow-on album, which, when combined with its new-found wealth, led to creative and personal tensions, fuelled by large amounts of drug and alcohol consumption, especially cocaine. The album the band members created was Rumours in 1977, in which the band lays bare the emotional turmoil experienced at that time. It became the best- selling album of the year, and it sold over 19 million copies worldwide by 1998. The RIAA certified Rumours as a diamond album. This lineup of the band continued to record for over a decade. Their 1979 album Tusk was a double album, more experimental in tone, still spawning three hit singles but selling nowhere near the quantity of Rumours . After solo albums by Nicks and Buckingham, 1982&#x27;s Mirage was a return to more commercial pop, but still didn&#x27;t reproduce the success of Rumours . The band went on hiatus, Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham continuing solo careers and Christine McVie issuing a solo album as well. In 1987, the band reconvened for Tango In The Night , some of which was originally destined for another Buckingham solo disc. The disc sold well and had several hit singles, but Buckingham refused to tour with the band and they parted ways acrimoniously. Buckingham was replaced with Rick Vito and Billy Burnette for the Tango In The Night tour, and this new lineup recorded the 1990 album Behind The Mask , which did not enjoy much commercial success. In 1991, Nicks and Vito announced they were leaving the band. Bekka Bramlett joined, and this lineup eventually recorded the unsuccessful album Time in 1995. In 1997, the &quot;classic&quot; Rumours line-up reunited for an MTV reunion special called The Dance . The live album sold over 5 million copies in the United States and spawned a 40-city tour. Following The Dance , Christine McVie retired from the band permanently, and the remaining four (Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, John McVie, and Mick Fleetwood) produced a new album released in 2003 called Say You Will . The new album included 18 new songs written by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. They then went on an 18-month worldwide tour over the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. In interviews given in November 2006 to support his solo album, Under The Skin , Buckingham stated that there were plans for the band to reunite once more for a 2008 tour but recording plans had been put on hold for the foreseeable future. In a September 2007 interview Stevie Nicks gave to the UK newspaper The Daily Telegraph, she noted that she is unwilling to carry on with the band unless Christine McVie returns. However in a recent interview, Mick Fleetwood said &quot;&#8230;be very happy and hopeful that we will be working again. I can tell you everyone&#x27;s going to be extremely excited about what&#x27;s happening with Fleetwood Mac. &quot; On June 9, 2008, The New York Times reported that Irving Azoff is in the process of negotiating a deal with Wal-Mart for Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s new album. The article states &quot;Mr. Azoff said that he was already talking to Wal-Mart about an exclusive deal for Fleetwood Mac's next release. &#x27;Classic rock really works there,&#x27; Mr. Azoff said. &quot; According to Stevie Nicks, &quot;the group will start working on material and recording probably in October, and finish an album. &quot; However, instead of returning to the studio, the band instead went back out on the road in 2009 for a greatest hits tour called &quot;Fleetwood Mac Unleashed,&quot; the first time the band have gone out on tour without an album to support. The tour saw the band play throughout the United States as well as returning, for the first time in years, to play dates in Canada, Europe, and the UK. On January 11, 2014, Mick Fleetwood announced that Christine McVie would be rejoining Fleetwood Mac, and the news was confirmed on January 13. www. fleetwoodmac. com/", "P!nk": "P!nk is a stylisation of Pink , a pseudonym of singer songwriter Alecia Beth Moore (b. 8 Sep 1979, in Doylestown, PA, USA), who gained prominence in early 2000. She has sold over 10 million albums in the United States, over 32 million worldwide, and has won three Grammy awards. P!nk began her career as an RnB artist, signed to the predominately urban label, LaFace Records. She has since complained that because she chose to relinquish creative control to her record label, she did not like the type of music she was making at that time, and did not like her image, which included bright Pink hair. Her first album, Can&#x27;t Take Me Home was a substantial success, going platinum, due to the huge pop and urban radio hit singles &quot;there you go&quot; and &quot;most girls&quot;. Towards the end of 2001, P!nk decided to take her career in a new direction and have more creative control. Tired of being marketed as a another cookie-cutter pop act, and eager to become a more serious singer-songwriter and musician, P!nk sought the help of former 4 Non Blondes vocalist, Linda Perry. Together, P!nk and Perry co-wrote and co-produced most of the tracks on P!nk&#x27;s sophomore album, M!ssundaztood , which was released in November 2001. The album&#x27;s more pop rock sound could be heard immediately with its first single, the Linda Perry penned &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;. &quot;Get the Party Started&quot; was a huge, commercially successful single, topping the charts in many countries. The album&#x27;s other singles, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Get Me&quot;, &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;, and &quot;Family Portrait&quot; were also radio and commercial successes. In 2003, P!nk released a new album called Try This . Eight of the thirteen tracks were co-written with Tim Armstrong of punk band Rancid. Try This reached the Top 10 on album charts in the US, Canada, UK and Australia in 2003. Though its singles &quot;Trouble&quot; and &quot;God Is A DJ&quot; didn&#x27;t do as well in her home country as her previous singles, &quot;Trouble&quot; earned Pink her second Grammy award in 2003. However the singles were largely successful in the United Kingdom and Australia. P!nk&#x27;s fourth album, I&#x27;m Not Dead was released in April 2006. The first single was the controversial and funny &quot;stupid girls&quot;. The album had started causing controversy before it was even released: the song dear mr. president is an open letter condemning the actions of President George W. Bush. P!nk appeared on the Australian TV show &quot;Rove Live&quot;, discussing the track, stating that it would never be released as a single in the United States, lest it be misinterpreted as a publicity stunt. A DVD containing concert footage of P!nk&#x27;s Try This European tour was released in May 2006. Her fifth album, funhouse , was released in October 2008, preceded by her first solo number one on the Billboard Hot 100, &quot;So What&quot;. The following singles from Funhouse, &quot;Sober&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Leave Me&quot;, both charted well on their releases around the world. In 2010 !nk collaborated on The Imagine Project singing Don&#x27;t Give Up and Imagine. She also featured in the track Won&#x27;t Back Down for Enimem&#x27;s album Recovery. In October 2010 she released the first single Raise Your Glass from her first compilation album Greatest Hits&#8230; So Far!!. P!nk was the voice actress of Gloria in the animated movie Happy Feet Two, which premiered in the US on November 18, 2011. She also sang the movie&#x27;s theme song Bridge of Light. P!nk&#x27;s sixth album The Truth About Love was first confirmed by P!nk by Twitter on February 29, 2012. The first single from this album Blow Me (One Last Kiss) was produced by Greg Kurstin and released on July 3. P!nk announced the album title the following day, along with the news of her upcoming world tour. On September 6th P!nk performed Blow Me (One Last Kiss) live at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards. In February 2013 P!nk started her &quot;Truth About Love Tour&quot;, which was so popular that she added additional dates for US/Canada and Australia. During this time her track Just Give Me A Reason rose up to 9th on the Hot 100, her 14th Top 10 hit on that chart. The following week this rose up to number 5, and two weeks later it topped the Billboard Hot 100 becoming her 4th number-one single in the US. It also topped the charts in several other countries worldwide, and held the top spot on the Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks. On April 29, 2013, Just Give Me a Reason became P!nk&#x27;s eighth number one on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Top 40, which resulted in her becoming the record holder for most number ones on that chart, beating out Maroon 5 and Katy Perry who each have seven. In 2013, Billboard named Pink Woman of the Year, citing the success of her album The Truth About Love and of the singles &quot;Blow Me (One Last Kiss)&quot;, &quot;Try&quot;, &quot;Just Give Me a Reason&quot;, and &quot;True Love&quot;, as well as her 2013 tour, which was extended to 140 different sets due to demand. The Truth About Love earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album earlier in 2013. After releasing The Truth About Love in 2012, RCA Records has announced that they have signed Pink for a multi-album deal that will last for years to come. ", "Deftones": "Deftones is an American Rock/Alternative Metal band from Sacramento, California, formed in 1988, consisting of Chino Moreno (lead vocals and guitar), Stephen Carpenter (guitar), Sergio Vega (bass), Frank Delgado (keyboards and turntables), and Abe Cunningham (drums and percussion). Vega (formerly of Quicksand ) took on bass duties in mid-2009 in substitution for Chi Cheng, who was seriously injured in an automobile accident in Santa Clara, California on November 4, 2008. Cheng remained in a coma until his death on April 13, 2013 due to cardiac arrest. While they were mostly an alternative metal band in their early years, their sound changed into something more complex and experimental in 2000, as a result they are often coined today as an alternative rock band. Critics have often praised them as one of the closest to unique rock bands of recent years for their innovative, atmospheric music; as Johnny Loftus writes, &quot;Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like dream pop and DC hardcore into their Northern California alt-metal. &quot; Frontman Chino Moreno's poetic lyrics--described by a Time magazine critic as \"fiercely intelligent\"--are often evocative, yet are sparse enough to allow for multiple interpretations. Moreno has cited Morrissey, Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, The Cure's Robert Smith, and Depeche Mode's David Gahan among his favorite singers, and beyond an occasional similarity in vocal technique, these singers' sweeping sense of drama and delicate vulnerability is often evident in Moreno's vocals. Deftones members have worked on several side projects, including Moreno's Team Sleep and drummer Abe Cunningam's Phallucy. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter works with a group called Kush, featuring members of Fear Factory and Cypress Hill. Turntablist Frank Delgado has a DJ crew with DJ Crook of Team Sleep, DJ Julez and Matt D called Decibel Devils. * Chino Moreno (vocals, guitar) * Stephen Carpenter (guitar) * Abe Cunningham (drums) * Chi Cheng (bass, backing vocals) * Frank Delgado (turntablist/keyboardist/sampler) (Incidentally, Carpenter is generally credited with \"strings\", though if he actually plays anything other than electric guitar it's not immediately apparent. This most likely refers to his abuse of the guitar strings, making screeching noises inbetween playing riffs. ) Releases: 1992 - like linus (demo) 1995 - Adrenaline 1997 - Around the Fur 2000 - White Pony 2002 - Music in High Places: Deftones - Live In Hawaii (DVD) 2002 - Back to School (Mini Maggit) (EP) 2003 - Deftones 2005 - B-Sides &amp; Rarities (with accompanying DVD video library and live footage) 2006 - Saturday Night Wrist 2009 - Eros ( Shelved) 2010 - Diamond Eyes 2011 - Covers 2012 - Koi No Yokan Album Around the Fur (1997) features Soulfly's Max Cavalera on PlayHeadup.

Album Saturday Night Wrist (2006) features System of a Down's Serj Tankian on Mein. Early years: 1989-1993 When Carpenter was 15 years old he was hit by a car while skateboarding. This left him confined to a wheelchair for several months. It was at this point that he began teaching himself guitar by playing along with bands such as Anthrax, Stormtroopers of Death and Metallica. It has been reported that the driver paid Carpenter a cash settlement that allowed the band to purchase equipment, but drummer Abe Cunningham commented in an interview that this was &quot;a myth about how our band was started. &quot; Carpenter, Moreno and Cunningham went to the same high school. They were childhood friends and remained friends through the skateboarding scene in Sacramento. When Moreno found out Carpenter played guitar, he set up a jam session with Cunningham and the three began playing regularly in Carpenter&#x27;s garage circa 1988. After playing with several bassists, the band settled on Justin Jaramillo and recorded a four track demo soon after. Within two years the band began playing club shows and later expanded their playing territory to San Francisco and Los Angeles where they played shows alongside bands such as Korn. While closing for another band in L. A. , after the majority of the audience had left, the band impressed a Maverick Records representative. They were soon after signed to the label after showcasing three of their songs for Freddy DeMann and Guy Oseary. The name &quot;Deftones&quot; was created by Carpenter who wanted to pick &quot;something that would just stand out but you know, not be all cheese-ball at the same time. &quot; Carpenter combined the hip hop slang term &quot;def&quot;, which was used by artists he listened to such as LL Cool J and Public Enemy, with the suffix &quot;-tones&quot;, which was a popular suffix among 50s bands whose music he also enjoyed (e. g. Dick Dale and the Deltones; The Quin-Tones, The Monotones, The Cleftones and The Harptones). Carpenter said the name is intentionally vague to reflect the band&#x27;s tendency to not focus on just one style of music. Adrenaline: 1994-1996 The band&#x27;s debut album, Adrenaline, was recorded at Bad Animals Studio in Seattle, Washington and released on October 3, 1995. It was produced by Deftones and Terry Date, who would go on to produce the band&#x27;s next three albums. Initially unsuccessful, extensive touring, word-of-mouth and Internet promotion built the band a dedicated fanbase, as well as helping Adrenaline to sell over 220,000 copies without the singles &quot;7 Words&quot; and &quot;Bored&quot; (as well as their music videos) receiving any airplay. The band contributed the non-album track &quot;Teething&quot; to the soundtrack for the 1996 film The Crow: City of Angels and are also seen performing the song live during one of the film&#x27;s scenes. The album spent 21 weeks on the Billboard Heatseekers chart reaching a peak position of 23. When asked what he attributed the album&#x27;s success to, Cheng responded, &quot;One word: perseverance. We&#x27;ve been together for almost eight years, on the road for two and we do it with honesty and integrity - and the kids can tell. &quot; The album was RIAA certified gold on 7 July 1999 in recognition of 500,000 units sold. Regarding the recording of the album, Abe Cunningham said, &quot;At the time we did the first record - which I really like and think is good - you can tell the band was really young. We&#x27;d been playing most of those songs for quite a while, and we were just so happy to be making a record that we didn&#x27;t really think a whole lot about making the songs better. &quot; Moreno felt that Adrenaline was recorded &quot;really fast&quot;[ and performed all his vocals live with the band in the room using a hand-held Shure 58 microphone. A review of Adrenaline praised the album&#x27;s musical control, precision, overall groove and Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly sophisticated drumming&quot;. It was also noted that &quot;there is a bit of sameness in Chino Moreno&#x27;s whispered vocal melodies, which drags the record down a bit. &quot; Adrenaline was certified platinum on September 23, 2008 by the RIAA Around the Fur: 1997-1999 Deftones&#x27; second album, Around the Fur, was recorded at Studio Litho in Seattle, Washington and produced by Terry Date. Released on October 26, 1997, the album included a collaboration with singer Max Cavalera (of Sepultura/Soulfly/Cavalera Conspiracy) on &quot;Headup&quot;, a tribute to Cavalera&#x27;s late stepson Dana Wells, to whom the album was also dedicated. Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado is credited as &quot;audio&quot; on five of the album&#x27;s tracks and Cunningham&#x27;s wife, Annalynn, provides guest vocals on &quot;MX&quot;. &quot;When we went in to make this record, we really didn&#x27;t have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with,&quot; said Moreno in a 1998 interview with Chart magazine. However, he felt that the album &quot;fell into place&quot; once the band had settled into the studio. The band expanded its sound, spending more time with Terry Date, and giving more thought to the album&#x27;s production. Cunningham varied his drum sound and experimented by using different types of snare drum on almost every track. The album was praised for its loud-soft dynamics, the flow of the tracks, Moreno&#x27;s unusual vocals and the strong rhythm-section grooves created by Cheng and Cunningham. Stephen Thomas Erlewine&#x27;s review noted that &quot;while they don&#x27;t have catchy riffs or a fully developed sound, Around the Fur suggests they&#x27;re about to come into their own. &quot; The album was highly anticipated and propelled the band to fame in the alternative metal scene on the strength of radio and MTV airplay for the singles &quot;My Own Summer (Shove It)&quot; and &quot;Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away)&quot;. Around the Fur sold 43,000 copies in its first week of release, and entered the Billboard 200 at number 29 (its peak position), remaining on the charts for 17 weeks. The band went back to touring, making appearances at the Warped Tour (in the United States, New Zealand and Australia), Pinkpop Festival, Roskilde Festival and Ozzfest as well as releasing a live EP on June 22, 1999. Around the Fur went on to reach RIAA gold status on June 24, 1999. White Pony: 2000-2002 On June 20, 2000, the band released their third album, White Pony, again produced by Terry Date and Deftones. It was recorded at The Plant Studios in Sausalito, California and at Larrabee Sound Studios, West Hollywood, California. The album debuted at number three in the US Billboard chart with sales of 178,000 copies. Delgado (DJ Speedboat) was now a full-time band member, adding new elements to the band&#x27;s music. The melancholy &quot;Teenager&quot;, for example, was a radical departure in style and mood, a &quot;love song,&quot; according to Moreno, which incorporated elements of glitch and trip hop, with programming duties carried out by Moreno&#x27;s friend and side-project Team Sleep bandmate DJ Crook. A collaboration with singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool is present on &quot;Passenger&quot;, and the refrain in &quot;Knife Party&quot; features vocals by Rodleen Getsic. Moreno had also started contributing additional guitar on several tracks. An interview with the band in Alternative Press explained the recording process of White Pony. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording White Pony, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of &quot;Change (In the House of Flies)&quot; was the turning point where the band began working as a group. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. Cheng explained that &quot;We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make. &quot; Moreno did not have a common theme in mind lyrically, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining that &quot;I basically didn't sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things. &quot; Reviews were generally positive, noting Moreno&#x27;s increasing sophistication as a lyricist and the group&#x27;s experimentalism. Of White Pony, one reviewer wrote that &quot;Deftones went soft, but in an impressive way, to twist around its signature punk sound. &quot; The album was originally released as an 11 track version beginning with &quot;Feiticeira&quot; and ending with &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; and featuring gray cover art. A limited edition print of 50,000 black and red jewel case versions of White Pony were also released at the same time with a bonus 12th track entitled &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Republic&quot;. Later, the band released &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot;, a rap-influenced interpretation of the album&#x27;s closer, &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;. &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot; was track 11 on the leaked pre-release version of White Pony in April 2000, but not included on the original (official) issue of the album in June 2000. The leaked version of White Pony also included the slower version of &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; which appeared on the first official White Pony CDs. That song was listed as a bonus track (track 12) on the leaked pre-release version. The song was picked up as a single and placed as the new opening track (with &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; still the closer) of a re-released White Pony on October 3, 2000 featuring altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have &quot;Back to School&quot; made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Chino noted that &quot;Everybody&#x27;s already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I&#x27;d be kind of feelin&#x27; like, &#x27;Man, why we putting all these different versions of the record?&#x27; that&#x27;s the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically. And if they wanna buy the record again, it&#x27;s cool. &quot; White Pony achieved platinum status, selling over 1. 3 million copies in the US, and earning the band a 2001 Grammy award for Best Metal Performance for the song &quot;Elite&quot;. Deftones: 2003-2005 Deftones began work on their fourth album under the working title Lovers. Regarding the album&#x27;s direction, Cheng commented that &quot;We&#x27;ve proven that we can musically go in any direction we want, and we want to get kind of heavy on this one. &quot; Moreno underwent vocal training as a precaution after severely damaging his vocal cords on the band&#x27;s 2001 summer tour. The band converted their rehearsal space in Sacramento into a fully equipped studio and recorded most of the album there at negligible cost. The band brought in Terry Date to assist with production, and also received input on musical arrangement from Greg Wells on several of the album&#x27;s tracks. The band later added more material at Studio X in Seattle, WA and at Larrabee Studios in West Hollywood, CA. Overall the album took twelve months and cost roughly $2. 5 million to produce with the band being fined by Maverick for missing deadlines. In January 2003, Deftones left the studio to perform some &quot;one off&quot; shows in Australia and New Zealand as part of the annual Big Day Out Festival. Shortly after, the band returned to the studio to finish their fourth album. The self-titled Deftones was released on May 20, 2003. Deftones entered the Billboard 200 at number two and sold 167,000 copies in its first week. The album remained in the Billboard top 100 for nine weeks, supported by the first single, &quot;Minerva&quot;. The band shot a video for their second single, &quot;Hexagram&quot;, with fans watching the band play the song in an indoor skatepark in Simi Valley, California. The band made a video for the track &quot;Bloody Cape&quot;, but it was never released for play on television. The video was only made available on the band&#x27;s official website for one day. It was later released on their B-Sides and Rarities DVD. Reviews were mainly positive, praising the band for the heavy album&#x27;s progression and originality in the midst of declining creativity in contemporary metal. Moreno was quoted as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s all on record. We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren&#x27;t going to be with them. &quot; In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes that &quot;Hexagram&quot;, the album&#x27;s opener, &quot;hits hard -- harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is,&quot; but also goes on to say that the album &quot;sticks a little too close to familiar territory. &quot; The Onion&#x27;s A. V. Club similarly called the album &quot;less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre. &quot; The band released a compilation album titled B-Sides &amp; Rarities on October 4, 2005. The CD includes various b-sides and covers from throughout their career, while the DVD contains behind-the-scenes footage and the band&#x27;s complete videography up to that point. Saturday Night Wrist: 2006-2007 Deftones performing live in Glasgow, June 2006. The band&#x27;s latest album, titled Saturday Night Wrist, was released on October 31, 2006. It debuted at number ten in the US Billboard chart with sales of just over 76,000, a significant decrease on the first week sales of their two previous releases. Rather than work with longtime producer Terry Date, Deftones decided to record with Bob Ezrin. Cunningham says that while the group enjoyed working with Date, &quot;At this point, we just needed to change things up And this is definitely a different style. Working with him is just putting us fucking upside down. He&#x27;s cracking the whip. &quot; After recording all the instrumentals for the record, Chino Moreno decided to record his vocals separately. Chino thus finished recording the album with former Far guitarist Shaun Lopez as producer. Collaborations on the record include Annie Hardy from Giant Drag on the song &quot;Pink Cellphone&quot; and Serj Tankian from System of a Down on the track &quot;Mein&quot;. The album&#x27;s first single was called &quot;Hole in the Earth&quot;, hitting the radio on October 16, 2006. &quot;Hole in the Earth&quot; was also featured as a downloadable song for the PS3 &amp; Xbox 360 versions of Guitar Hero 3. &quot;Mein&quot; was the album&#x27;s second single, which aired in Spring of 2007. As of March 2007, Saturday Night Wrist has sold over 250,000 copies (US). Deftones spent the majority of 2006 and 2007 touring around the world in support of the album. The band played shows in places including North America, Canada, Europe, South America, Japan and Australia. The band also performed in such tours as Taste of Chaos, Family Values Tour and the Soundwave Festival in Australia. Eros: 2008-2009 Deftones are currently in the studio writing and recording their next release, Eros, which will once again utilize the production services of Terry Date. Deftones have been writing the album since Fall 2007. As of December 7, 2007, six to eight songs were finished and the album is expected to be released in the winter of 2008. Chino Moreno has described the album as weird, unorthodox, featuring a lot of atmosphere and soundscaping, and having &quot;fuck you, I hope you die!&quot; style aggression. He has also stated that he won&#x27;t be contributing on guitar, instead focusing on his vocals, and will leave guitar duties entirely to Stephen Carpenter. Carpenter will be utilizing his signature 8-String guitar, the ESP Stef B-8. They started recording the album on April 14th, 2008. Moreno stated that this album would be more up-tempo (as far as the drumming is concerned), going on to say that the past couple of albums have been more mid-tempo; that Abe Cunningham has been playing faster. He also referred to the album as being &quot;snappy&quot;. Moreno stated in an interview that the process for this album would be more raw and simplified after dissatisfaction with the long and &quot;pieced-together&quot; experience of recording Saturday Night Wrist. On January 14th, Chino Moreno posted an instrumental electronic beat that sounds similar to Team Sleep called &quot;You&#x27;ve Seen The Butcher&quot;, on the Deftones&#x27; MySpace page, and announced in a bulletin that the album would be called Eros, the Greek word for &quot;love. &quot; It was also announced that Eros would be released by Reprise Records, the first time Deftones have released an album not affiliated with Maverick Records. On September 18, Deftones played a secret show at the Spaceland Club in Los Angeles. The band played a new song entitled Melanie, which they also played at the previously announced headlining show at the Ventura Theater in Ventura, California on September 19 and also at the KUPD&#x27;s End of Summer Scorcher on September 20 in Peoria, Arizona, where they co-headlined with Alice In Chains. Also, recently Deftones have been posting a number of videos on MySpace and their blog, documenting the recording process of Eros. On November 4, bassist Chi Cheng was seriously injured in a car accident in Santa Clara, California. Chino Moreno posted on the band&#x27;s blog, saying, &quot;It deeply saddens me to inform you all that our brother Chi Cheng was involved in a terrible car accident last night. He is currently in a Northern California hospital in serious, but stable condition. I am on my way up north right now to be by his side, along with the rest of our bandmates and family. Chi is one of the strongest people I know, and I&#x27;m praying that his strength will get him through this. Please say a prayer for him as well. &quot; Following the accident, Cheng&#x27;s bandmates and mother, Jeanne, began using the Deftones blog to post updates on Cheng&#x27;s condition. In a post dated November 18, it was stated that &quot;Chi&#x27;s condition remains the same - serious, but stable. He still lies in a coma, however his vitals (heart, lungs, and blood pressure) all exhibit very stable functions and doctors have begun removing much of the excess monitoring equipment. &quot; In a blog posted dated November 9, it was reported that Chi was attended by three off-duty EMTs who happened upon the accident scene. The post goes on to state that &quot;If not for them, the chances of Chi making to the hospital alive would have been poor. &quot; On December 9, it was announced that Chi had been moved into the care of an unnamed hospital that &quot;specializes in the care and management of traumatic and non-trauma related brain injuries&quot;. Diamond Eyes: 2010-2011 It was announced that the new album would be titled &quot;Diamond Eyes&quot;, to be released May 18th, 2010.

Koi No Yokan: 2012 On March 29, 2012 an interview with Stephen Carpenter was posted on ESP Guitars&#x27;s YouTube channel. In it, Carpenter talks about his switch to 7-string and 8-string guitars. At the end, he says, &quot;Musically, me and my band, Deftones, are working on a new record and we hope to have it finished and out by Summer of 2012, and when the new record&#x27;s done we&#x27;ll start another touring cycle and get out there and play our stuff for those who are interested. &quot; Chino Moreno has also stated that it has resemblance to their 2000 record, White Pony, when it&#x27;s compared to their previous work. \"The songs are very different from each other, not heavier or slower, but more dynamic, going towards several directions, it's heavy, but beautiful. \" In addition, it has been reported that Nick Raskulinecz will return to produce their seventh effort, which is, as of yet, unnamed. On April 3, 2012 after performing at the Quilmes Rock 2012 festival, Chino was interviewed about Crosses and the new Deftones record. He said that the writing process was completed last week and they start recording after he gets back from South America. &quot;We start recording next week. I love it, I&#x27;m so excited about it because Deftones, obviously, that&#x27;s my life, I&#x27;ve made a career since I was fifteen years old and right before I came last week we finished all the writing so, next week, when I get back, we start recording. We should have a record that comes out in the early Fall, maybe October. Maybe September. &quot; The album was released through Reprise Records on November 12, 2012, in the UK and November 13, 2012, in the United States. Band frontman Chino Moreno characterized the album as &quot;dynamic&quot; with a full range of sound, noting that more contributions were made to the album from bassist Sergio Vega compared to their previous record, Diamond Eyes.

Through that same friend, La Havas was also introduced to British singer, Paloma Faith; she later sang backing vocals on tour for Faith. La Havas was co-writer and performer in &#x27;The Paris Parade&#x27; alongside Christian Pinchbeck (who designed the artwork for Lost &amp; Found) and also is now part of the duo Elephant (Memphis Industries).

His influences include David Bowie, Damien Rice, Oasis, The Beatles, U2, Pink Floyd and Fleetwood Mac. Born on born 9th January 1987 in Paisley, Scotland, his father is of Italian descent and his mother Glaswegian, although his father&#x27;s family have been in Scotland for four generations. Nutini had no formal music training, and was expecting to follow his father into the family fish and chip shop business. He was first encouraged to sing by his music-loving grandfather and a teacher at his school who recognised his talent. He left school to work as a roadie and to sell T-shirts for Speedway and spent three years learning the music business, performing live, alone and with a band, and working as a studio hand at Glasgow&#x27;s Park Lane Studio. His big chance came when he attended a concert for David Sneddon&#x27;s return to his home town of Paisley at the beginning of 2003. Sneddon was delayed, and as the winner of an impromptu pop quiz, Nutini was given the chance to perform a couple of songs on stage during the wait. The favourable reaction of the crowd impressed another member of the audience, who offered to become his manager. A Daily Record journalist, John Dingwall, saw him performing at the Queen Margaret Union, and invited him to appear live on Radio Scotland. Still only seventeen, he moved to London, and performed regularly at the Bedford pub in Balham whilst still legally too young to drink alcohol himself. Other radio and live appearances followed, including two live acoustic spots on Radio London, The Hard Rock Cafe, and support slots for Amy Winehouse and KT Tunstall. His debut album, These Streets , produced by Ken Nelson (Coldplay/Gomez), was released on 17th July 2006, and immediately entered the U. K. album charts at number three. Many of the songs on the album, including &quot;Last Request&quot; and &quot;Rewind&quot;, were inspired by a turbulent relationship with a girlfriend, and &quot;Jenny Don&#x27;t Be Hasty&quot; is a true story about encounters with an older woman.

Charice started singing at the age of 4. Her talent was discovered by her mother, Raquel, who was also the lead vocalist in a band in her younger days. Her mother became her vocal coach and so began her training. &quot;CHARICE! Remember the name!&quot; was the statement made onstage by David &quot;the Hit Man&quot; Foster (multi-award winning songwriter) on his birthday tribute held in Mandalay Bay Resort, in Las Vegas last May 2008, wherein Charice received the first ever standing ovation given to an entertainer in that venue, from an audience of 10,000. At the age of 7, Charice began to join local singing competitions, winning most of them, eventually graduating into nationwide and syndicated television shows, competing nationally. It wasn&#x27;t until 2005 when she was 13 and competed in the show &quot;Little Big Star&quot; (a show which can be likened to the &quot;Idol&quot; franchise, in which the participants get voted in or out by text votes) that she really started to garner attention and build her own so-called fanbase. One of Charice&#x27;s fans, later known as FalseVoice, made a video of one of her performances from the show pitting it against the performance of another well-known young singer, Bianca Ryan ( the 11 year old winner of America&#x27;s Got Talent) and posted it on YouTube. That video received thousands of views and got the attention of Ten Songs Production in Sweden who invited Charice to fly to Stockholm in June 2007 to record seven songs. The same video brought Charice to the attention of one of the most popular TV Shows in Korea, &quot;Star King&quot;, another talent show for children. In October 2007, Charice was invited to appear on the Star King show in Korea, where she performed the songs &quot;And I Am Telling You&quot; (soundtrack from the movie &quot;Dreamgirls&quot;, sung by Jennifer Hudson). A Korean viewer made a video of Charice&#x27;s now famous performance and posted it on UCC, a video hosting website in Korea equivalent to YouTube. It became a huge hit. Several copies of the video of her performance on Star King appeared on YouTube and garnered over a million hits todate (and still counting!). Charice was also voted by the show&#x27;s judges as the Best Performer for that show. She also performed a duet with one of the Super Junior singers, singing &quot;A Whole New World&quot; (from the movie &quot;Aladdin&quot;. She was later invited back by Star King to once again perform on the show, as she was the Most Requested Foreign Act. Charice spent Christmas Day 2007, in Korea, performing Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, and performing a duet with Korea&#x27;s Lena Park, singing &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; made famous by Whitney Houston. Around that time several videos of her performances were popping up like popcorn on YouTube, gaining worldwide viewership totalling in the millions, until eventually she was discovered by the US talk show host, Ellen Degeneres. On 19 December 2007, she appeared on the show Ellen, where she once again performed the songs &quot;And I Am Telling You&quot; and &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. She received standing ovations for both performances. It was an emotional moment for Charice as it marked the beginning of her journey to international stardom. Her performance on Ellen turned Charice into an instant celebrity in her native country and she became the most celebrated performer and sought after artist nationwide. She also garnered more international attention as a result of her guest appearance on Ellen. The UK&#x27;s Paul O&#x27;Grady show invited Charice in April 2008 to perform on the show. By special request from the show&#x27;s host, Charice performed the same songs she performed on Ellen. Once again, Charice received a standing ovation for each of her performances. Paul O&#x27;Grady was not the only TV personality who took notice of Charice&#x27;s singing prowess. Around the same time, David Foster, who also saw her performance on Ellen, contacted Oprah about Charice. At the time Oprah&#x27;s show was planning a special episode focusing on children with special talents. It was a big break for Charice as she was invited to be part of Oprah&#x27;s show as one of the kids with special talent. And that she has!!! In May 2008, Charice appeared on Oprah and she performed the song &quot;I Have Nothing&quot;, another song made famous by Whitney Houston. Charice wowed the audience and once again, she received a well-deserved standing ovation! Her performance was explosive! Between Oprah and David Foster, it was arranged that Charice will be part of David Foster&#x27;s birthday tribute concert entitled &quot;David Foster &amp; Friends, held at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas, which was also held in May 2008. It was in that concert that Charice was introduced by David Foster as the next international singing sensation. Charice shared the stage with the likes of Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban, Michael Buble, Alicia Keys, Katharine McPhee and other international artists. In July 2008, Charice flew to Tuscany, Italy, on the invitation of famous Italian tenor, Andrea Bocelli, who, after hearing Charice&#x27;s performance at David Foster&#x27;s concert in Las Vegas, wanted to sing a duet with Charice. The concert was held at the Teatro del Silencio in Lajatico, Italy and was attended by over 8,000 people. Charice performed the requested duet with Andrea Bocelli, singing &quot;The Prayer&quot;, a song that has special meaning for both herself and the Maestro. Charice also performed solo, singing her now signature song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. In September 2008, she was flown into The Netherlands to perform in front of an audience of over 50,000 football fans, celebrating Feyenoord&#x27;s Centennial Anniversary, titled &quot;The Festival of the Century&quot;. Charice was requested to sing the team&#x27;s theme song &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. On 9 September 2008, she once again appeared on Oprah&#x27;s show as the featured guest for the episode &quot;Dreams Come True&quot;. Oprah introduced Charice as the Most Talented Girl in World. The show focused on Charice&#x27;s amazing talent as well as the trials and tribulations of her young life. It also highlighted Charice&#x27;s childhood dreams, some of which have already come true! Charice also talked about her lifetime dream of singing a duet with her ultimate idol Celine Dion. They even showed Charice&#x27;s dream journal where she draws herself performing with her favourite artists. On the Oprah show, she performed the very first song she ever learned &ndash; &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (theme song from the movie &quot;Titanic&quot;). She was accompanied on the piano by David Foster himself, who was also a guest on the show, indicating a collaboration between himself and Oprah as regards Charice&#x27;s future in the entertainment world. After Charice&#x27;s soul-touching rendition (which again gained her another standing ovation), she received a surprise from Oprah with the appearance of Celine Dion on satellite video. Celine Dion then invited Charice (on national television) to perform with her at her concert the following week at none other than Madison Square Garden, New York! Charice was moved to tears as another one of her dreams comes true! The following week, (15 September 2008) was another incredible milestone in Charice&#x27;s still very young international career. She was met by Celine Dion at Madison Square Garden on the day of the concert, went to rehearsals and then performed that night at Madison Square Garden. Celine also made a grand introduction of Charice, repeating that Charice is the Most Talented Girl in the World. She also said that Charice has &quot;a voice that can literally blow the roof off Madison Square Garden! And she just might tonight!&quot; The crowd of 18,000 roared from the moment Charice started making her way down to the audience and up to the stage to join Celine. It was a hair-raising performance, with Celine graciously stepping aside to let Charice shine and get all the limelight, only stepping in every now and then, adding more dynamics to the song, &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;. On Celine&#x27;s suggestion Charice dedicated to her mother, who was also in the audience. Although it was only meant to be a one-song performance, the crowd clamored for more. The roar from the crowd was deafening and Celine declared at the end of the song that the roof of Madison Square Garden blew off that night! The write-ups that followed about the concert and the amazing performance of this 16 year old child prodigy is testament to the fact that Charice has definitely arrived into the international music scene! And she&#x27;s definitely one to watch out for! Remember the name: CHARICE!", "Aram Il'yich Khachaturian": "Aram Khachaturian was born in Tbilisi, Georgia, Imperial Russia to a poor Armenian family. In his youth, he was fascinated by the music he heard around him, but at first he did not study music or learn to read it. In 1921, he travelled to Moscow to join his brother, unable to speak a word of Russian. Although he had almost no musical education, Khachaturian showed such great talent that he was admitted to the Gnessin Institute where he studied cello under Mikhail Gnessin and entered a composition class (1925). In 1929, he transferred to the Moscow Conservatory where he studied under Nikolai Myaskovsky. In the 1930s, he married the composer Nina Makarova, a fellow student from Myaskovsky's class. In 1951, he became professor at the Gnessin State Musical and Pedagogical Institute (Moscow) and the Moscow Conservatory. He also held important posts at the Composers' Union, which would later severely denounce some of his works as being \"formalist\" music, along with those of Sergei Prokofiev and Dmitri Shostakovich. These three composers became the so called \"titans\" of Soviet music, enjoying world-wide reputation as some of the leading composers of the 20th century. Khachaturian's works include concertos for violin (also transcribed for flute), cello, and piano (the latter originally including an early part for the flexatone), concerto-rhapsodies for the same instruments, three symphonies--the third containing parts for fifteen additional trumpets and organ, and the ballets Spartak (AKA Spartacus) and Gayane (the adagio was used in Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey). The latter ballet features in its final act what is probably his most famous movement, the \"Sabre Dance. \" He also wrote some piano music such as the song &quot;Two Ladies Gossiping,&quot; a quick and lively song. He also composed some film music and incidental music for plays such as the 1941 production of Mikhail Lermontov's Masquerade. The cinematic quality of his music for Spartacus was clearly seen when it was used as the theme for a popular BBC drama series, The Onedin Line, during the 1970s. Since then, it has become one of the most popular of all classical pieces for UK audiences. Joel Coen's The Hudsucker Proxy also prominently featured music from Spartacus and Gayane (Sabre Dance included) mixed with the original compositions by Carter Burwell. He was also the composer for the state anthem of the Armenian SSR, whose tune is one of the five current choices to become the next state anthem of Armenia. The climax of Spartacus' second movement was also used in Ice Age: The Meltdown.

Other minor hits included \"Goodbye to You\" (1982 - #65 US), \"Love's Got A Line On You\" (1983 - #59 US), and \"Hands Tied\" (1984 - #41 US). Scandal was formed in New York City in 1981 by guitarist Zack Smith, who also wrote most of the band's hits. The other initial members included: bassist Ivan Elias (1950-1995), guitarist Keith Mack, guitarist Jon Bon Jovi (briefly), keyboardist Benjy King, drummer Frankie LaRocka, and vocalist Patty Smyth. Thommy Price later replaced LaRocka on drums. The band had much success early on but due to struggles within the group and their record company, it slowly dissolved--losing member after member. By the time \"The Warrior\" tour hit the road in 1984, all that remained of the original lineup were Smyth and Mack. Scandal broke up shortly after the tour ended in 1985. The group (minus Ivan Elias, who died of cancer in June 1995) reunited in 2004 for VH1's Bands Reunited show and did a string of concerts on the United States East Coast culminating in a show at Irving Plaza in their home city (New York) on February 9, 2005. During the summer of 2006, the band (excluding Thommy Price) reunited again for VH1's \"We Are The 80's\" tour, playing a string of large - mainly outdoor - venues and earning critical acclaim. During the summer and fall of 2007, they toured again (this time without Zack Smith). In July 2008, Billboard reported the upcoming release of new music by Patty Smyth and Scandal (featuring original members Keith Mack and Benjy King). At a performance in Dewey Beach, DE on August 3, 2008, Smyth indicated Scandal would be releasing a new five song EP in the near future. Scandal also performed one of their new songs, \"Trust In Me\". Other new titles include \"Make It Hard\" and \"End Of The Girl\". Patty Smyth &amp; Scandal debuted their first single as a band (\"Hard For You To Love Me\", also referred to as \"Make It Hard\") in over 24 years on January 17, 2009 in Ridgefield, CT to a standing ovation. Patty Smyth stated the song will be available to purchase digitally in February 2009, with the new EP to follow shortly.

", "Frank Ocean": "Frank Ocean (born October 28, 1987) is an American singer/songwriter and member of the gleefully hedonistic hip-hop collective OFWGKTA. He was born Christopher &quot;Lonny&quot; Breaux in New Orleans, Louisiana, and now resides in Beverly Hills. He has helped pen tracks for Justin Bieber, John Legend, Brandy, and Beyonce Knowles over the last few years. In 2011, Ocean released his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra, for free via his Tumblr. Venting about his decision to drop the record his own way, he took to Twitter on March 1, 2011: &quot;i. did. this. not ISLAND DEF JAM. that&#x27;s why you see no label logo on the artwork that I DID. guess its my fault for trusting my dumbass lawyer and signing my career over to a failing company. fuck Def Jam &amp; any company that goes the length of signing a kid with dreams &amp; talent w/ no intention of following through. fuck em. now back to my day. i want some oatmeal and toast. brunch swag. &quot; Compared to the mainstream r&amp;b/hip-hop music we hear on the radio now-a-days, Ocean is a breath of fresh air. As a member of the Odd Future (OFWGKTA) collective, his sound is distinctively soulful/r&amp;b influenced, yet done in a way that could pass for something totally different. As Tyler, the Creator states, \"It's Smooth Ass Music About Bitches, Relationships And Being A Rich Young Nigga. . . But In A Swagged Out Way. \" Ocean was evacuated from the University of New Orleans to Los Angeles, California just as Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005, and stayed in Los Angeles to pursue a music career. Ocean joined Los Angeles based collective OFWGKTA, who he met through mutual friends, at the end of 2009. In the end of 2009, he met Tricky Stewart, who helped Ocean sign a contract with Def Jam Recordings as an artist, however, he was initially unable to build a relationship with the company. In 2010, he changed his name from Christopher &quot;Lonny&quot; Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean via a legal website. In an April 2011 interview, Ocean intimated that his relationship with Def Jam has strengthened since the release of his mixtape. On April 28, 2011, Ocean was arrested on unspecified charges by the LAPD, and was released on the morning after on April 29, 2011. Ocean joined his OFWGKTA bandmates for the first time on tour from May 12 to May 19, 2011. On May 31, 2011, Def Jam released the single Novacane on iTunes soon followed by Swim Good Taken from his mixtape Nostalgia, ULTRA. His first &#x27;proper&#x27; album, &quot;Channel Orange&quot; was released on July 17th, 2012.
